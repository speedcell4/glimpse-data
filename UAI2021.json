    "abstract": "Variational inference has had great success in scaling approximate Bayesian inference to big data by exploiting mini-batch training. To date, however, this strategy has been most applicable to models of independent data. We propose an extension to state space models of time series data based on a novel generative model for latent temporal states: the neural moving average model. This permits a subsequence to be sampled without drawing from the entire distribution, enabling training iterations to use mini-batches of the time series at low computational cost. We illustrate our method on autoregressive, Lotka-Volterra, FitzHugh-Nagumo and stochastic volatility models, achieving accurate parameter estimation in a short time",

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning ability is heavily desired for machine intelligence. By meta-learning a model initialization from training tasks with fast adaptation ability to new tasks, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has achieved remarkable success in a number of few-shot learning applications. However, theoretical understandings on the learning ability of MAML remain absent yet, hindering developing new and more advanced meta learning methods in a principled way. In this work, we solve this problem by theoretically justifying the fast adaptation capability of MAML when applied to new tasks. Specifically, we prove that the learnt meta-initialization can benefit the fast adaptation to new tasks with only a few steps of gradient descent. This result explicitly reveals the benefits of the unique designs in MAML. Then we propose a theory-inspired task similarity aware MAML which clusters tasks into multiple groups according to the estimated optimal model parameters and learns group-specific initializations. The proposed method improves upon MAML by speeding up the adaptation and giving stronger few-shot learning ability. Experimental results on the few-shot classification tasks testify its advantages",

In Bayesian statistics, biased estimators of the model evidence have been often used as stochastic objectives because the existing debiasing techniques are computationally costly to apply. To overcome this issue, we apply an MLMC sampling technique to construct low-variance unbiased estimators both for the model evidence and its gradient. In the theoretical analysis, we show that the computational cost required for our proposed MLMC estimator to estimate the model evidence or its gradient with a given accuracy is an order of magnitude smaller than those of the previously known estimators. Our numerical experiments confirm considerable computational savings compared to the conventional estimators. Combining our MLMC estimator with gradient-based stochastic optimization results in a new scalable, efficient, debiased inference algorithm for Bayesian statistical models",

However, we show here how CIFs can be used as part of an auxiliary VI scheme to formulate and train expressive posterior approximations in a natural way. We exploit the conditional independence structure of multi-layer CIFs to build the required auxiliary inference models, which we show empirically yield low-variance estimators of the model evidence.

With NOP, TreeBERT extracts the syntactical structure by learning the order constraints of nodes in AST. We pre-trained TreeBERT on datasets covering multiple programming languages.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), despite their tremendous success in recent years, could still cast doubts on their predictions due to the intrinsic uncertainty associated with their learning process. Ensemble techniques and post-hoc calibrations are two types of approaches that have individually shown promise in improving the uncertainty calibration of DNNs. However, the synergistic effect of the two types of methods has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a truth discovery framework to integrate ensemble-based and post-hoc calibration methods. Using the geometric variance of the ensemble candidates as a good indicator for sample uncertainty, we design an accuracy-preserving truth estimator with provably no accuracy drop. Furthermore, we show that post-hoc calibration can also be enhanced by truth discovery-regularized optimization. On large-scale datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet, our method shows consistent improvement against state-of-the-art calibration approaches on both histogram-based and kernel density-based evaluation metrics.

In this work, we propose a model-agnostic data augmentation method that allows us to exploit the prior knowledge of the CI encoded in a CG for supervised machine learning.

We take into account the presence of not only unobserved common causes but also unobserved intermediate variables. Our theoretical results show that, when the causal relationships are nonlinear and there are unobserved variables, it is not possible to identify all the causal relationships between observed variables through regression and independence tests.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation in deep models is essential in many real-world applications and has benefited from developments over the last several years. Recent evidence suggests that existing solutions dependent on simple Gaussian formulations may not be sufficient. However, moving to other distributions necessitates Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate quantities such as the KL divergence: it could be expensive and scales poorly as the dimensions of both the input data and the model grow. This is directly related to the structure of the computation graph, which can grow linearly as a function of the number of MC samples needed. Here, we construct a framework to describe these computation graphs, and identify probability families where the graph size can be independent or only weakly dependent on the number of MC samples. These families correspond directly to large classes of distributions. Empirically, we can run a much larger number of iterations for MC approximations for larger architectures used in computer vision with gains in performance measured in confident accuracy, stability of training, memory and training time",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has shown its ability in producing models that are robust to perturbations on the input data, but usually at the expense of a decrease in the standard accuracy. To mitigate this issue, it is commonly believed that more training data will eventually help such adversarially robust models generalize better on the benign/unperturbed test data. In this paper, however, we challenge this conventional belief and show that more training data can hurt the generalization of adversarially robust models in classification problems. We first investigate the Gaussian mixture classification with a linear loss and identify three regimes based on the strength of the adversary. In the weak adversary regime, more data improves the generalization of adversarially robust models. In the medium adversary regime, with more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent curve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training data hurts the generalization. In the strong adversary regime, more data almost immediately causes the generalization error to increase. Then we analyze a two-dimensional classification problem with a 0-1 loss. We prove that more data always hurts generalization of adversarially trained models with large perturbations. Empirical studies confirm our theoretical results",

In each meta-training episode, a discriminative feature embedding and/or classifier are first constructed from a support set in an inner loop, and then evaluated in an outer loop using a query set for model updating. This query set sample centered learning objective is however intrinsically limited in addressing the lack of training data problem in the support set. In this paper, a novel contrastive prototype learning with augmented embeddings (CPLAE) model is proposed to overcome this limitation. First, data augmentations are introduced to both the support and query sets with each sample now being represented as an augmented embedding (AE) composed of concatenated embeddings of both the original and augmented versions. Second, a novel support set class prototype centered contrastive loss is proposed for contrastive prototype learning (CPL). With a class prototype as an anchor, CPL aims to pull the query samples of the same class closer and those of different classes further away. This support set sample centered loss is highly complementary to the existing query centered loss, fully exploiting the limited training data in each episode. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CPLAE achieves new state-of-the-art",

The teacher classifier is a combined expert that leverages knowledge of domain experts that can be theoretically guaranteed to handle perfectly source examples, while the student classifier acting on the target domain tries to imitate the teacher classifier acting on the source domains. Our rigorous theory developed based on optimal transport makes this cross-domain imitation possible and also helps to mitigate not only the data shift but also the label shift, which are inherently thorny issues in DA research. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the merit of our approach and its optimal transport based imitation learning viewpoint.

Therefore, we focus on robust sequential patrol planning for green security following the minimax regret criterion, which has not been considered in the literature. We formulate the problem as a game between the defender and nature who controls the parameter values of the adversarial behavior and design an algorithm MIRROR to find a robust policy. MIRROR uses two reinforcement learning–based oracles and solves a restricted game considering limited defender strategies and parameter values. We evaluate MIRROR on real-world poaching data",

    "title": "Defending SVMs against poisoning attacks: the hardness and DBSCAN approach",
    "abstract": "Adversarial machine learning has attracted a great amount of attention in recent years. Due to the great importance of support vector machines (SVM) in machine learning, we consider defending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper. We study two commonly used strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms and data sanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before, most of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience, or rely on strong assumptions about the data distribution or the attacker’s behavior. Moreover, the research on the hardness of designing a quality-guaranteed adversarially-resilient SVM algorithm is still quite limited. We are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to prove that even the simplest hard-margin one-class SVM with adversarial outliers problem is NP-complete, and has no fully PTAS unless P=NP. For data sanitization, we explain the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a density-based outlier removal method) for defending against poisoning attacks. In particular, we link it to the intrinsic dimensionality by proving a sampling theorem in doubling metrics. In our empirical experiments, we systematically compare several defenses including the DBSCAN and robust SVM methods, and investigate the influences from the intrinsic dimensionality and poisoned fraction to their performances",

Although adversarial bandit algorithms achieve low regret, they do not exploit the matrix structure and perform poorly relative to the new algorithms.

The premise of all current systems-of-inference for deriving CIs in PGMs, is that the set of CIs used for the construction of the PGM hold exactly. In practice, algorithms for extracting the structure of PGMs from data, discover approximate CIs that do not hold exactly in the distribution. In this paper, we ask how the error in this set propagates to the inferred CIs read off the graphical structure. More precisely, what guarantee can we provide on the inferred CI when the set of CIs that entailed it hold only approximately? It has recently been shown that in the general case, no such guarantee can be provided. We prove that such a guarantee exists for the set of CIs inferred in directed graphical models, making the d-separation algorithm a sound and complete system for inferring approximate CIs.

For discrete domains, weighted model counting has emerged as an effective and general approach in a variety of formalisms. Weighted first-order model counting, which allows relational atoms and function-free first order logic has pushed the envelope further, by exploiting symmetry properties over indistinguishable groups of objects, and by extension avoids the need to perform inference on the exponential ground theory. Given the limitation to discrete domains, the formulation of weighted model integration was proposed as an extension to weighted model counting for mixed discrete-continuous domains over both symbolic and numeric weight functions. While that formulation has enjoyed considerable attention in recent years, there is very little understanding on whether the task can be solved at a lifted level, that is, whether we can reason with relational models by avoiding grounding.

However, for safety critical tasks, such as robotics and healthcare, it is necessary to provide some specific guarantees before the deployment in a real world context. Even in these scenarios, where high cost equipment and human safety are involved, the evaluation of the models is usually performed with the standard metrics (i.e., cumulative reward or success rate). In this paper, we introduce a novel metric for the evaluation of models in safety critical tasks, the violation rate. We build our work upon the concept of formal verification for neural networks, providing a new formulation for the safety properties that aims to ensure that the agent always makes rational decisions. To perform this evaluation, we present ProVe (Property Verifier), a novel approach based on the interval algebra, designed for the analysis of our novel behavioral properties. We apply our method to different domains (i.e., mapless navigation for mobile robots, trajectory generation for manipulators, and the standard ACAS benchmark).

To this end, we introduce uncertainty units for Laplace-approximated networks: Hidden units associated with a particular weight structure that can be added to any pre-trained, point-estimated network. Due to their weights, these units are inactive—they do not affect the predictions. But their presence changes the geometry (in particular the Hessian) of the loss landscape, thereby affecting the network’s uncertainty estimates under a Laplace approximation. We show that such units can be trained via an uncertainty-aware objective, improving standard Laplace approximations’ performance in various uncertainty quantification tasks",

We develop a measure-theoretic perspective on WMC and propose a way to encode conditional weights on literals analogously to conditional probabilities. This representation can be as succinct as standard WMC with weights on literals but can also expand as needed to represent probability distributions with less structure. To demonstrate the performance benefits of conditional weights over the addition of extra literals, we develop a new WMC encoding for Bayesian networks and adapt a state-of-the-art WMC algorithm ADDMC to the new format.

Furthermore, it can then perform one-shot learning and use newly learned concepts for inferring additional novel concepts. We evaluate this approach in a new set of environments, showing that agents successfully learn to reason by elimination, and can also learn novel concepts and use them for further reasoning.

    "title": "FlexAE: flexibly learning latent priors for wasserstein auto-encoders",
    "abstract": "Auto-Encoder (AE) based neural generative frameworks model the joint-distribution between the data and the latent space using an Encoder-Decoder pair, with regularization imposed in terms of a prior over the latent space. Despite their advantages, such as stability in training, efficient inference, the performance of AE based models has not reached the superior standards of the other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Motivated by this, we examine the effect of the latent prior on the generation quality of deterministic AE models in this paper. Specifically, we consider the class of Generative AE models with deterministic Encoder-Decoder pair (such as Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE), Adversarial Auto-Encoder (AAE)), and show that having a fixed prior distribution, a priori, oblivious to the dimensionality of the ‘true’ latent space, will lead to the infeasibility of the optimization problem considered. As a remedy to the issue mentioned above, we introduce an additional state space in the form of flexibly learnable latent priors, in the optimization objective of WAE/AAE. Additionally, we employ a latent-space interpolation based smoothing scheme to address the non-smoothness that may arise from highly flexible priors. We show the efficacy of our proposed models, called FlexAE and FlexAE-SR, through several experiments on multiple datasets, and demonstrate that FlexAE-SR is the new state-of-the-art for the AE based generative models in terms of generation quality as measured by several metrics such as Fr\\’echet Inception Distance, Precision/Recall score",

    "abstract": "Greedy coordinate descent (GCD) is an efficient optimization algorithm for a wide range of machine learning and data mining applications. GCD could be significantly faster than randomized coordinate descent (RCD) if they have similar per iteration cost. Nevertheless, in some cases, the greedy rule used in GCD cannot be efficiently implemented, leading to huge per iteration cost and making GCD slower than RCD. To alleviate the cost per iteration, the existing solutions rely on maximum inner product search (MIPS) as an approximate greedy rule. But it has been empirically shown that GCD with approximate greedy rule could suffer from slow convergence even with the state-of-the-art MIPS algorithms. We propose a hybrid coordinate descent algorithm with a simple variable partition strategy to tackle the cases when greedy rule cannot be implemented efficiently. The convergence rate and theoretical properties of the new algorithm are presented. The proposed method is shown to be especially useful when the data matrix has a group structure. Numerical experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our new algorithm is competitive against RCD, GCD, approximate GCD with MIPS and their accelerated variants",

    "abstract": "Tucker decomposition is a classical tensor factorization model. Compared with the most widely used CP decomposition, the Tucker model is much more flexible and interpretable in that it accounts for every possible (multiplicative) interaction between the factors in different modes. However, this also brings in the risk of overfitting and computational challenges, especially in the case of fast streaming data. To address these issues, we develop BASS-Tucker, a BAyesian Streaming Sparse Tucker decomposition method. We place a spike-and-slab prior over the core tensor elements to automatically select meaningful factor interactions so as to prevent overfitting and to further enhance the interpretability. To enable efficient streaming factorization, we use conditional moment matching and Delta’s method to develop one-shot incremental update of the latent factors and core tensor upon receiving each streaming batch. Thereby, we avoid processing the data points one by one as in the standard assumed density filtering, which needs to update the core tensor for each point and is quite inefficient. We explicitly introduce and update a sparse prior approximation in the running posterior to fulfill effective sparse estimation in the streaming inference. We show the advantage of BASS-Tucker in several real-world applications",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. BO budgets are typically given in iterations, which implicitly assumes each evaluation has the same cost. In fact, in many BO applications, evaluation costs vary significantly in different regions of the search space. In hyperparameter optimization, the time spent on neural network training increases with layer size; in clinical trials, the monetary cost of drug compounds vary; and in optimal control, control actions have differing complexities. Cost-constrained BO measures convergence with alternative cost metrics such as time, money, or energy, for which the sample efficiency of standard BO methods is ill-suited. For cost-constrained BO, cost efficiency is far more important than sample efficiency. In this paper, we formulate cost-constrained BO as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and develop an efficient rollout approximation to the optimal CMDP policy that takes both the cost and future iterations into account.

Yet, in critical applications such as in healthcare or justice, if models cannot be explained, domain experts will be reluctant to use them. A common way to explain a black-box model is to approximate it by a simpler model such as a decision tree. In this paper, we propose a co-learning framework to learn decision rules as explanations of black-box models through knowledge distillation and simultaneously constrain the black-box model by these explanations; all of this in a differentiable manner. To do so, we introduce the soft truncated Gaussian mixture analysis (STruGMA), a probabilistic model which encapsulates hyper-rectangle decision rules. With STruGMA, global explanations can be extracted by any rule learner such as decision lists, sets or trees. We provide evidences through experiments that our framework can globally explain differentiable black-box models such as neural networks. In particular, the explanation fidelity is increased, while the accuracy of the models is marginally impacted",

This is a important classical problem, with close connections to statistical literature in permutation-based models and also has wide applications ranging from archaeology to biology. Specifically, we consider the case where the rows are monotonically increasing after an unknown permutation of the columns. Past work has shown that the least-squares estimator is optimal up to logarithmic factors, but efficient algorithms for computing the least-squares estimator remain unknown to date. We approach this important problem from a heuristic perspective. Specifically, we replace the combinatorial permutation constraint by a continuous regularization term, and then use projected gradient descent to obtain a local minimum of the non-convex objective. We show that the attained local minimum is the global minimum in certain special cases under the noiseless setting, and preserves desirable properties under the noisy setting. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm outperforms prior algorithms when (1) the underlying model is more complex than simplistic parametric assumptions such as low-rankedness, or (2) the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Under partial observations, the proposed algorithm requires an initialization, and different initializations may lead to different local minima.

In LocalNewton, the worker machines update their model in every iteration by finding a suitable second-order descent direction using only the data and model stored in their own local memory. We let the workers run multiple such iterations locally and communicate the models to the master node only once every few (say $L$) iterations. LocalNewton is highly practical since it requires only one hyperparameter, the number $L$ of local iterations. We use novel matrix concentration based techniques to obtain theoretical guarantees for LocalNewton, and we validate them with detailed empirical evaluation. To enhance practicability, we devise an adaptive scheme to choose $L$, and we show that this reduces the number of local iterations in worker machines between two model synchronizations as the training proceeds, successively refining the model quality at the master. Via extensive experiments using several real-world datasets with AWS Lambda workers and an AWS EC2 master, we show that LocalNewton requires fewer than $60%$ of the communication rounds (between master and workers) and less than $40%$ of the end-to-end running time, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, to reach the same training loss",

Many algorithms for NAS consist of searching through a space of architectures by iteratively choosing an architecture, evaluating its performance by training it, and using all prior evaluations to come up with the next choice. The evaluation step is noisy - the final accuracy varies based on the random initialization of the weights. Prior work has focused on devising new search algorithms to handle this noise, rather than quantifying or understanding the level of noise in architecture evaluations. In this work, we show that (1) the simplest hill-climbing algorithm is a powerful baseline for NAS, and (2), when the noise in popular NAS benchmark datasets is reduced to a minimum, the loss landscape becomes near-convex, causing hill-climbing to outperform many popular state-of-the-art algorithms. We further back up this observation by showing that the number of local minima is substantially reduced as the noise decreases and by giving a theoretical characterization of the performance of local search in NAS. Based on our findings, for NAS research we suggest (1) using local search as a baseline, and (2) denoising the training pipeline when possible",

This paper initiates a rigorous study on the efficiency of particle filtering for sequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity bounds.

In particular, we show that, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice.

However, a generalization theory for the neural networks has not been well developed, because several essential factors for the theory, such as network size and margin distribution, are not deeply connected to the invariance and equivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization error bound for invariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the effect of invariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of a quotient feature space, which measures the effect of group actions for the properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature spaces can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that the invariance and equivariance significantly improves the leading term of the bound. We apply our result to a specific invariant and equivariant networks, such as DeepSets (Zaheer et al., NIPS 2017), and show that their generalization bound is considerably improved by $\\sqrt{n!}$, where $n!$ is the number of permutations. We also discuss the expressive power of invariant DNNs and show that they can achieve an optimal approximation rate. Moreover, we conducted experiments to support our results",

We propose an optimization framework for SMSC, which guarantees a constant-factor approximation. Our algorithm’s key idea is to construct a new instance of submodular function maximization from a given instance of SMSC, which can be approximated efficiently.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the relationship between generalization and privacy preservation of machine learning in two steps. We first establish an alignment between the two facets for any learning algorithm. We prove that $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy implies an on-average generalization bound for a multi-sample-set learning algorithm, which further leads to a high-probability bound for any learning algorithm. We then investigate how the iterative nature shared by most learning algorithms influences privacy preservation and further generalization. Three composition theorems are proved to approximate the differential privacy of an iterative algorithm through the differential privacy of its every iteration. Integrating the above two steps, we eventually deliver generalization bounds for iterative learning algorithms. Our results are strictly tighter than the existing works. Particularly, our generalization bounds do not rely on the model size which is prohibitively large in deep learning. Experiments of MLP, VGG, and ResNet on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 are in full agreement with our theory. The theory applies to a wide spectrum of learning algorithms.

We find that this is possible if and only if the two variables are ‘densely connected’; in other words, if applications of identifiable causal interventions on the graph cannot (non-trivially) separate them. As a consequence of this, we can also allow such pairs of random variables have any bivariate joint distribution that we choose.

We contribute in this direction and propose a novel adversarial defense method called Synonym Encoding Method (SEM). Specifically, SEM inserts an encoder before the input layer of the target model to map each cluster of synonyms to a unique encoding and trains the model to eliminate possible adversarial perturbations without modifying the network architecture or adding extra data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEM can effectively defend the current synonym substitution based attacks and block the transferability of adversarial examples.

    "title": "Path-BN: Towards effective batch normalization in the Path Space for ReLU networks",
    "abstract": "Neural networks with ReLU activation functions (abbrev. ReLU Networks), have demonstrated their success in many applications. Recently, researchers noticed that ReLU networks are positively scale-invariant (PSI) while the weights are not. This mismatch may lead to undesirable behaviors in the optimization process. Hence, some new algorithms that conduct optimization directly in the path space (the path space is proven to be PSI) were developed, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the path space. %nd it was shown that, SGD in the path space is superior to that in the weight space. However, it is still unknown that whether other deep learning techniques such as batch normalization (BN), could also have their counterparts in the path space. In this paper, we conduct a formal study on the design of BN in the path space. First, we propose path-reparameterization of ReLU networks, in which the weights in the networks are reparameterized by path-values. Then, the feedforward and backward propagation of the path-reparameterized networks can calculate the values of the hidden nodes and the gradients in the path space, respectively. Next, we design the a novel way to do batch normalization for the path-reparameterized ReLU networks, called Path-BN. Specifically, we notice that, path-reparameterized ReLU NNs have a portion of constant weights which play more critical roles to form the basis of the path space. We propose to exclude these constant weights when doing batch normalization and prove that, by doing so, the scale and the direction of the trained parameters can be more effectively decoupled during training. Finally, we conduct experiments on benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed Path-BN can improve the performance of the optimization algorithms in the path space",

We focus on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues — prediction sets using conformal prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by post-hoc binning — since these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d. data. Two common ways of generalizing beyond the i.i.d. setting include handling covariate and label shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ, the former has already received attention, but not the latter. It is known that label shift hurts prediction, and we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by showing degradation in coverage and calibration. Piggybacking on recent progress in addressing label shift (for better prediction), we examine the right way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal and calibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target distribution is available. We examine these techniques theoretically in a distribution-free framework and demonstrate their excellent practical performance",

In this work, we propose a geometric gradient analysis (GGA) to improve the identification of untrustworthy predictions without retraining of a given model. GGA analyzes the geometry of the loss landscape of neural networks based on the saliency maps of their respective input. We observe considerable differences between the input gradient geometry of trustworthy and untrustworthy predictions.

While in networks that do not use skip connections, convergence to the NTK requires one to fix the depth, while increasing the layers’ width.

Neural networks can be used to learn good representations that encode intricate structures in high dimensional data, and can be used as inputs to the GP kernel. However the huge data requirement of neural networks makes this approach ineffective in small data settings. To solves the conflicting problems of representation learning and data efficiency, we propose to learn deep kernels on probabilistic embeddings by using a probabilistic neural network. Our approach maps high-dimensional data to a probability distribution in a low dimensional subspace and then computes a kernel between these distributions to capture similarity. To enable end-to-end learning, we derive a functional gradient descent procedure for training the model. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in GP kernel learning in both supervised and semi-supervised settings.

However, on mixed variable spaces, surrogate models other than GPs are prevalent, mainly due to the lack of kernels which can model complex dependencies across different types of variables. In this paper, we propose the frequency modulated(FM) kernel flexibly modeling dependencies among different types of variables, so that BO can enjoy the further improved sample efficiency. The FM kernel uses distances on continuous variables to modulate the graph Fourier spectrum derived from discrete variables. However, the frequency modulation does not always define a kernel with the similarity measure behavior which returns higher values for pairs of more similar points. Therefore, we specify and prove conditions for FM kernels to be positive definite and to exhibit the similarity measure behavior. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of GP BO using FM kernels(BO-FM). On synthetic problems and hyperparameter optimization problems, BO-FM outperforms competitors consistently. Also, the importance of the frequency modulation principle is empirically demonstrated on the same problems. On joint optimization of neural architectures and SGD hyperparameters, BO-FM outperforms competitors including Regularized evolution(RE) and BOHB.

    "title": "Compositional abstraction error and a category of causal models",
    "abstract": "Interventional causal models describe several joint distributions over some variables used to describe a system, one for each intervention setting. They provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint distributions and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the system. Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M’ and then further simplifying that to obtain M”, we expect the composite transformation from M to M” to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce a category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of enriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our framework",

    "title": "Bayesian optimization for modular black-box systems with switching costs",
    "abstract": "Most existing black-box optimization methods assume that all variables in the system being optimized have equal cost and can change freely at each iteration. However, in many real-world systems, inputs are passed through a sequence of different operations or modules, making variables in earlier stages of processing more costly to update. Such structure induces a dynamic cost from switching variables in the early parts of a data processing pipeline. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for switch-cost-aware optimization called Lazy Modular Bayesian Optimization (LaMBO). This method efficiently identifies the global optimum while minimizing cost through a passive change of variables in early modules. The method is theoretically grounded which achieves a vanishing regret regularized with switching cost. We apply LaMBO to multiple synthetic functions and a three-stage image segmentation pipeline used in a neuroimaging task, where we obtain promising improvements over existing cost-aware Bayesian optimization algorithms. Our results demonstrate that LaMBO is an effective strategy for black-box optimization capable of minimizing switching costs",

However, the number of inducing points is generally not associated with uncertainty which prevents us from applying the apparatus of Bayesian reasoning for identifying an appropriate trade-off. In this work we place a point process prior on the inducing points and approximate the associated posterior through stochastic variational inference. By letting the prior encourage a moderate number of inducing points, we enable the model to learn which and how many points to utilise. We experimentally show that fewer inducing points are preferred by the model as the points become less informative, and further demonstrate how the method can be employed in deep Gaussian processes and latent variable modelling",

    "abstract": "Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with hidde variables are often used to characterize causal relations between variables in a system. When some variables are unobserved, DAGs imply a notoriously complicated set of constraints on the distribution of observed variables. In this work, we present entropic inequality constraints that are implied by e-separation relations in hidden variable DAGs with discrete observed variables. The constraints can intuitively be understood to follow from the fact that the capacity of variables along a causal pathway to convey information is restricted by their entropy; e.g. at the extreme case, a variable with entropy 0 can convey no information. We show how these constraints can be used to learn about the true causal model from an observed data distribution. In addition, we propose a measure of causal influence called the minimal mediary entropy, and demonstrate that it can concisely augment traditional measures such as the average treatment effect",

However, such decoupled approaches are inherently sub-optimal. Designing an unsupervised loss function to train a GNN and extract communities in an integrated manner is a fundamental challenge. To tackle this problem, we combine the principle of self-expressiveness with the framework of self-supervised graph neural network for unsupervised community detection for the first time in literature.

Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable “what-to-draw” per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models.

PALM generatively learn the alignment of two protein sequences with probabilistic area distance objective, which can denoise the measurement errors contained in the ground-truth alignments. During learning, we show that the optimization is computationally efficient by estimating the gradients via dynamically sampling alignments. Empirically, we show that PALM can generate sequence alignments with higher precision and recall, as well as smaller area distance than the competing methods especially for long protein sequences and remote homologies.

Assume $\\theta_1 > \\theta_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq\\theta_n$. We propose an adaptive algorithm which explores the gaps and variances of the rewards of the arms and makes future decisions based on the gathered information using a novel approach called grouped median elimination.

Motivated by these facts, we propose to replace a dense linear layer in any neural network by an architecture based on the butterfly network. The proposed architecture significantly improves upon the quadratic number of weights required in a standard dense layer to nearly linear with little compromise in expressibility of the resulting operator. In a collection of wide variety of experiments, including supervised prediction on both the NLP and vision data, we show that this not only produces results that match and at times outperform existing well-known architectures, but it also offers faster training and prediction in deployment. To understand the optimization problems posed by neural networks with a butterfly network, we also study the optimization landscape of the encoder-decoder network, where the encoder is replaced by a butterfly network followed by a dense linear layer in smaller dimension.

Even worse, the problem may not be noticed, and an alleged CW still be produced. In this paper, we therefore address the problem as a ”testification” task, by which we mean a combination of testing and identification: The online identification of the CW is combined with the statistical testing of the CW assumption. Thus, instead of returning a supposed CW at some point, the learner has the possibility to stop sampling and refuse an answer in case it feels confident that the CW assumption is violated. Analyzing the testification problem formally, we derive lower bounds on the expected sample complexity of any online algorithm solving it.

Through careful experimentation on UCI datasets, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace dataset, we find that the overfitting from overparameterized deep kernel learning, in which the model is “somewhat Bayesian”, can in certain scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian at all.

The causal structure underlying each such model is naturally represented by a directed graph whose edges indicate for each variable which other variables it causally depends upon. Under a number of different model assumptions, it has been shown that this causal graph and, thus also, causal effects are identifiable from mere observational data. For these models, practical algorithms have been devised to learn the graph. Moreover, when the graph is known, standard techniques may be used to give estimates and confidence intervals for causal effects. We argue, however, that a two-step method that first learns a graph and then treats the graph as known yields confidence intervals that are overly optimistic and can drastically fail to account for the uncertain causal structure. To address this issue we lay out a framework based on test inversion that allows us to give confidence regions for total causal effects that capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure and numerical size of nonzero effects.

We formalize this problem as risk minimization under fairness and abstention constraints for which we derive the form of the optimal classifier. Building on this result, we propose a post-processing classification algorithm, which is able to modify any off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only unlabeled sample. We establish finite sample risk, fairness, and abstention guarantees for the proposed algorithm. In particular, it is shown that fairness and abstention constraints can be achieved independently from the initial classifier as long as sufficiently many unlabeled data is available. The risk guarantee is established in terms of the quality of the initial classifier. Our post-processing scheme reduces to a sparse linear program allowing for an efficient implementation, which we provide.

This approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has substantial practical utility in disease modelling — by applying our approach to COVID-19 mortality data from Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we can make informative predictions on important epidemiological quantities such as the current effective reproduction number",

    "abstract": "We propose injective generative models called Trumpets that generalize invertible normalizing flows. The proposed generators progressively increase dimension from a low-dimensional latent space. We demonstrate that Trumpets can be trained orders of magnitudes faster than standard flows while yielding samples of comparable or better quality. They retain many of the advantages of the standard flows such as training based on maximum likelihood and a fast, exact inverse of the generator. Since Trumpets are injective and have fast inverses, they can be effectively used for downstream Bayesian inference. To wit, we use Trumpet priors for maximum a posteriori estimation in the context of image reconstruction from compressive measurements, outperforming competitive baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and speed. We then propose an efficient method for posterior characterization and uncertainty quantification with Trumpets by taking advantage of the low-dimensional latent space",

    "title": "Stochastic model for sunk cost bias",
    "abstract": "We present a novel model for capturing the behavior of an agent exhibiting sunk-cost bias in a stochastic environment. Agents exhibiting sunk-cost bias take into account the effort they have already spent on an endeavor when they evaluate whether to continue or abandon it. We model planning tasks in which an agent with this type of bias tries to reach a designated goal. Our model structures this problem as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking, the agent traverses a directed acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions, paying costs for its actions as it tries to reach a target node containing a specified reward. The agent’s sunk cost bias is modeled by a cost that it incurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent decides to stop traversing the graph, it incurs a cost of $\\lambda \\cdot C_{sunk}$, where ${\\lambda \\geq 0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and $C_{sunk}$ is the sum of costs already invested. We analyze the behavior of two types of agents: naive agents that are unaware of their bias, and sophisticated agents that are aware of it. Since optimal (bias-free) behavior in this problem can involve abandoning the traversal before reaching the goal, the bias exhibited by these types of agents can result in sub-optimal behavior by shifting their decisions about abandonment. We show that in contrast to optimal agents, it is computationally hard to compute the optimal policy for a sophisticated agent. Our main results quantify the loss exhibited by these two types of agents with respect to an optimal agent. We present both general and topology-specific bounds",

In their original derivation, APFs operate in an extended state space using an auxiliary variable to improve inference. In this work, we propose optimized auxiliary particle filters, a framework where the traditional APF auxiliary variables are interpreted as weights in a importance sampling mixture proposal. Under this interpretation, we devise a mechanism for proposing the mixture weights that is inspired by recent advances in multiple and adaptive importance sampling. In particular, we propose to select the mixture weights by formulating a convex optimization problem, with the aim of approximating the filtering posterior at each timestep. Further, we propose a weighting scheme that generalizes previous results on the APF (Pitt et al. 2012), proving unbiasedness and consistency of our estimators. Our framework demonstrates significantly improved estimates on a range of metrics compared to state-of-the-art particle filters at similar computational complexity in challenging and widely used dynamical models",

Episodic meta-learning attempts to simulate a realistic setting by generating a set of small artificial tasks from a larger set of training tasks for meta-training and proceeds in a similar fashion for meta-testing. However, this (meta-)learning paradigm has recently been shown to be brittle, suggesting that the inductive bias encoded in the learned representations is inadequate. In this work we propose to compose episodes to robustify meta-learning in the few-shot setting in order to learn more efficiently and to generalize better to new tasks. We make use of active learning scoring rules to select the data to be included in the episodes. We assume that the meta-learner is given new tasks at random, but the data associated to the tasks can be selected from a larger pool of unlabeled data, and investigate where active learning can boost the performance of episodic meta-learning. We show that instead of selecting samples at random, it is better to select samples in an active manner especially in settings with out-of-distribution and class-imbalanced tasks.

    "abstract": "To capture the slowly time-varying spectral content of real-world time series, a common paradigm is to partition the data into approximately stationary intervals and perform inference in the time-frequency domain. This approach, however, lacks a corresponding nonstationary time-domain generative model for the entire data and thus, time-domain inference, such as sampling from the posterior, occurs in each interval separately. This results in distortion/discontinuity around interval boundaries and, consequently, can lead to erroneous inferences based on any quantities derived from the posterior, such as the phase. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Piecewise Locally Stationary Oscillation (PLSO) generative model for decomposing time-series data with slowly time-varying spectra into several oscillatory, piecewise-stationary processes. PLSO, being a nonstationary time-domain generative model, enables inference on the entire time-series, without boundary effects, and, at the same time, provides a characterization of its time-varying spectral properties. We propose a novel two-stage inference algorithm that combines the classical Kalman filter and the recently-proposed accelerated proximal gradient algorithm to optimize the nonconvex Whittle likelihood from PLSO.

In the tabular setting, many state-of-the-art methods produce the required optimism through approaches which are intractable when scaling to deep RL. We re-interpret these scalable optimistic model-based algorithms as solving a tractable noise augmented MDP. This formulation achieves a competitive regret bound: ˜ O (∣ S ∣ H √∣ A ∣ T ) when augmenting using Gaussian noise, where T is the total number of environment steps. We also explore how this trade-off changes in the deep RL setting, where we show empirically that estimation error is signiﬁcantly more troublesome.

Many common approaches to solve the collaborative ﬁltering task are based on learning representations of users and items, including simple matrix factorization, Gaussian process latent variable models, and neural-network based embeddings. While matrix factorization approaches fail to model nonlinear relations, neural networks can potentially capture such complex relations with unprecedented predictive power and are highly scalable. However, neither of them is able to model predictive uncertainties. In contrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate a predictive distribution, but cannot scale to large amounts of data. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach combining the representation learning paradigm of collaborative ﬁltering with multi-output Gaussian processes in a joint framework to generate uncertainty-aware recommendations. We introduce an efﬁcient strategy for model training and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and sparse datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of clas-sical metrics quantifying the reconstruction error. In addition to accurately predicting user preferences, our model also provides meaningful uncertainty estimates about that prediction",

    "title": "Generalization error bounds for deep unfolding RNNs",
    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful models with the ability to model sequential data. However, they are often viewed as black-boxes and lack in interpretability. Deep unfolding methods take a step towards interpretability by designing deep neural networks as learned variations of iterative optimization algorithms to solve various signal processing tasks. In this paper, we explore theoretical aspects of deep unfolding RNNs in terms of their generalization ability. Specifically, we derive generalization error bounds for a class of deep unfolding RNNs via Rademacher complexity analysis. To our knowledge, these are the first generalization bounds proposed for deep unfolding RNNs. We show theoretically that our bounds are tighter than similar ones for other recent RNNs, in terms of the number of timesteps. By training models in a classification setting, we demonstrate that deep unfolding RNNs can outperform traditional RNNs in standard sequence classification tasks. These experiments allow us to relate the empirical generalization error to the theoretical bounds. In particular, we show that over-parametrized deep unfolding models like reweighted-RNN achieve tight theoretical error bounds with minimal decrease in accuracy, when trained with explicit regularization",

    "title": "Contingency-aware influence maximization: A reinforcement learning approach",
    "abstract": "The inﬂuence maximization (IM) problem aims at ﬁnding a subset of seed nodes in a social network that maximize the spread of inﬂuence. In this study, we focus on a sub-class of IM problems, where whether the nodes are willing to be the seeds when being invited is uncertain, called contingency-aware IM . Such contingency aware IM is critical for applications for non-proﬁt organi-zations in low resource communities (e.g., spread-ing awareness of disease prevention). Despite the initial success, a major practical obstacle in pro-moting the solutions to more communities is the tremendous runtime of the greedy algorithms and the lack of high performance computing (HPC) for the non-proﬁts in the ﬁeld – whenever there is a new social network, the non-proﬁts usually do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions. Motivated by this and inspired by the line of works that use reinforcement learning (RL) to address combinatorial optimization on graphs, we formalize the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use RL to learn an IM policy over historically seen networks, and generalize to unseen networks with negligible runtime at test phase. To fully exploit the properties of our targeted problem, we propose two technical innovations that improve the existing methods, including state-abstraction and theoretically grounded reward shaping. Empirical results show that our method achieves inﬂuence as high as the state-of-the-art methods for contingency-aware IM, while having negligible runtime at test phase",

    "title": "Invariant representation learning for treatment effect estimation",
    "abstract": "The defining challenge for causal inference from observational data is the presence of `confounders', covariates that affect both treatment assignment and the outcome. To address this challenge, practitioners collect and adjust for the covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However, including every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including `bad controls', variables that \\emph{induce} bias when they are conditioned on. The problem is that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are safe to adjust for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn a representation of the covariates that, under some assumptions, strips out bad controls but preserves sufficient information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting for the learned representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the induced bias and provides valid causal inferences. NICE is appropriate in the following setting. i) We observe data from multiple environments that share a common causal mechanism for the outcome, but that differ in other ways. ii) In each environment, the collected covariates are a superset of the causal parents of the outcome, and contain sufficient information for causal identification. iii) But the covariates also may contain bad controls, and it is unknown which covariates are safe to adjust for and which ones induce bias. We evaluate NICE on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data. When the covariates contain unknown collider variables and other bad controls, NICE performs better than existing methods that adjust for all the covariates",

Past work in this field has relied on traditional optimization algorithms that ignore the inherent structure of the problem and data, or generative methods that rely purely on learning and often fail to generate adversarial examples where they are hard to find. To alleviate these deficiencies, we propose a novel attack based on a graph neural network (GNN) that takes advantage of the strengths of both approaches; we call it AdvGNN. Our GNN architecture closely resembles the network we wish to attack. During inference, we perform forward-backward passes through the GNN layers to guide an iterative procedure towards adversarial examples. During training, its parameters are estimated via a loss function that encourages the efficient computation of adversarial examples over a time horizon. We show that our method beats state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, including PGD-attack, MI-FGSM, and Carlini and Wagner attack, reducing the time required to generate adversarial examples with small perturbation norms by over 65\\%. Moreover, AdvGNN achieves good generalization performance on unseen networks.

A default choice for the (conditional) independence test is the (partial) correlation test, which can fail in presence of nonlinear relations between the variables. Recent research proposes a Bayesian nonparametric two-sample test (Holmes et al., 2015), an independence test between continuous variables (Filippi and Holmes, 2017), and a conditional independence test between continuous variables (Teymur and Filippi, 2019). We extend this work by proposing a novel Bayesian nonparametric conditional two-sample test. We utilise this conditional two-sample test for testing the conditional independence $C \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Y |X$ where C denotes a Bernoulli random variable, and X and Y are continuous one-dimensional random variables. This enables a nonparametric implementation of the Local Causal Discovery (LCD) algorithm with binary variables in the experimental setup (e.g. an indicator of treatment/control group). We propose a fair performance measure for comparing frequentist and Bayesian tests in the LCD setting. We utilise this performance measure for comparing our Bayesian ensemble with state-of-the-art frequentist tests, and conclude that the Bayesian ensemble has better performance than its frequentist counterparts.

We provide data-dependent generalisation error bounds for all three aforementioned algorithms when they are applied to graphs drawn from a partially labelled extension of a versatile latent space graph generative model. The bounds we obtain enable us to characterise the predictive performance as measured by accuracy in terms of homophily and label quantity. Building on this we develop a key notion of GLM-safety which enables us to compare G-SSL algorithms on the basis of the range of graphs on which they obtain a guaranteed accuracy.

However, existing GP approximations do not simultaneously support large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series which is a hallmark of many applications. Pseudo-point approximations, one of the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs to large data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid spatial data. However, they cannot handle long temporal observation horizons effectively reverting to cubic computational scaling in the time dimension. State space GP approximations are well suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear complexity in the number of temporal observations, but have a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle off-the-grid spatial data. In this work we show that there is a simple and elegant way to combine pseudo-point methods with the state space GP approximation framework to get the best of both worlds. The approach hinges on a surprising conditional independence property which applies to space–time separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more scalable and applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal problems than either method on its own",

In this work we introduce a novel theoretically motivated Class Balancing regularizer for training GANs. Our regularizer makes use of the knowledge from a pretrained classifier to ensure balanced learning of all the classes in the dataset. This is achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based on the exponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN to focus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our regularizer in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via achieving better performance than existing approaches over multiple datasets.

To address this issue, we develop a novel nonlocal gradient to skip small local minima by capturing major structures of the loss’s landscape in blackbox optimization. The nonlocal gradient is defined by a directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach. The key idea of DGS is to conducts 1D long-range exploration with a large smoothing radius along d orthogonal directions in R, each of which defines a nonlocal directional derivative as a 1D integral. Such long-range exploration enables the nonlocal gradient to skip small local minima. The d directional derivatives are then assembled to form the nonlocal gradient. We use the GaussHermite quadrature rule to approximate the d 1D integrals to obtain an accurate estimator.

Recent work has proposed several methods to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning agents to adversarial perturbations based on training in the presence of these imperceptible perturbations (i.e. adversarial training). In this paper, we study the effects of adversarial training on the neural policy learned by the agent. In particular, we follow two distinct parallel approaches to investigate the outcomes of adversarial training on deep neural policies based on worst-case distributional shift and feature sensitivity. For the first approach, we compare the Fourier spectrum of minimal perturbations computed for both adversarially trained and vanilla trained neural policies. Via experiments in the OpenAI Atari environments we show that minimal perturbations computed for adversarially trained policies are more focused on lower frequencies in the Fourier domain, indicating a higher sensitivity of these policies to low frequency perturbations. For the second approach, we propose a novel method to measure the feature sensitivities of deep neural policies and we compare these feature sensitivity differences in state-of-the-art adversarially trained deep neural policies and vanilla trained deep neural policies.

    "title": "Statistically robust neural network classification",
    "abstract": "Recently there has been much interest in quantifying the robustness of neural network classifiers through adversarial risk metrics. However, for problems where test-time corruptions occur in a probabilistic manner, rather than being generated by an explicit adversary, adversarial metrics typically do not provide an accurate or reliable indicator of robustness. To address this, we introduce a statistically robust risk (SRR) framework which measures robustness in expectation over both network inputs and a corruption distribution. Unlike many adversarial risk metrics, which typically require separate applications on a point-by-point basis, the SRR can easily be directly estimated for an entire network and used as a training objective in a stochastic gradient scheme. Furthermore, we show both theoretically and empirically that it can scale to higher-dimensional networks by providing superior generalization performance compared with comparable adversarial risks",

    "title": "Constrained differentially private federated learning for low-bandwidth devices",
    "abstract": "Federated learning becomes a prominent approach when different entities want to learn collaboratively a common model without sharing their training data. However, Federated learning has two main drawbacks. First, it is quite bandwidth inefﬁcient as it involves a lot of message exchanges between the aggregating server and the participating entities. This bandwidth and corresponding processing costs could be prohibitive if the participating entities are, for example, mobile devices. Furthermore, although federated learning improves privacy by not sharing data, recent attacks have shown that it still leaks information about the training data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme. The proposed scheme provides theoretical privacy guarantees, as it is based on Differential Privacy. Furthermore, it optimizes the model accuracy by constraining the model learning phase on few selected weights. Finally, as shown experimentally, it reduces the upstream and downstream bandwidth by up to 99.9% compared to standard federated learning, making it practical for mobile systems",

    "title": "Know your limits: Uncertainty estimation with ReLU classifiers fails at reliable OOD detection",
    "abstract": "A crucial requirement for reliable deployment of deep learning models for safety-critical applications is the ability to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) data points, samples which differ from the training data and on which a model might underper-form. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem using uncertainty estimation techniques. However, there is empirical evidence that a large family of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classiﬁcation tasks. This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental ﬁndings and illustrates it on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not able to reliably identify OOD samples in a classiﬁcation setting, since their level of conﬁdence is generalized to unseen areas of the feature space. This result stems from the interplay between the representation of ReLU networks as piece-wise afﬁne transformations, the saturating nature of activation functions like softmax, and the most widely-used uncertainty metrics",

    "abstract": "Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) is a central task in knowledge representation, learning, and reasoning. There is vast literature on efficient algorithms for constructing data structures and performing exact and approximate NNS. This paper studies NNS under Uncertainty (NNSU). Specifically, consider the setting in which an NNS algorithm has access only to a stochastic distance oracle that provides a noisy, unbiased estimate of the distance between any pair of points, rather than the exact distance. This models many situations of practical importance, including NNS based on human similarity judgements, physical measurements, or fast, randomized approximations to exact distances. A naive approach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm and repeatedly query and average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise) whenever it needs a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of repeated queries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point may be distant from all but one other point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large number of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how ideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an NNSU algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the (unknown) geometry of the dataset",

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, agents that consider the context, or current state, when selecting source policies for transfer have been shown to outperform context-free approaches. However, none of the existing approaches transfer knowledge contextually from model-based learners to a model-free learner. This could be useful, for instance, when source policies are intentionally learned on diverse simulations with plentiful data but transferred to a real-world setting with limited data. In this paper, we assume knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and common sub-goals but different dynamics. We introduce a novel deep mixture-of-experts formulation for learning state-dependent beliefs over source task dynamics that match the target dynamics using state trajectories collected from the target task. The mixture model is easy to interpret, demonstrates robustness to estimation errors in dynamics, and is compatible with most learning algorithms. We then show how this model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym",

    "abstract": "When data contains measurement errors, it is necessary to make modeling assumptions relating the error-prone measurements to the unobserved true values. Work on measurement error has largely focused on models that fully identify the parameter of interest. As a result, many practically useful models that result in bounds on the target parameter – known as partial identiﬁcation – have been neglected. In this work, we present a method for partial identiﬁcation in a class of measurement error models involving discrete variables. We focus on models that impose linear constraints on the target parameter, allowing us to compute partial identiﬁcation bounds using off-the-shelf LP solvers. We show how several common measurement error assumptions can be composed with an extended class of instrumental variable-type models to cre-ate such linear constraint sets. We further show how this approach can be used to bound causal parameters, such as the average treatment effect, when treatment or outcome variables are measured with error.

    "title": "Bias-corrected peaks-over-threshold estimation of the CVaR",
    "abstract": "The conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a useful risk measure in ﬁelds such as machine learning, ﬁnance, insurance, energy, etc. When measuring very extreme risk, the commonly used CVaR estimation method of sample averaging does not work well due to limited data above the value-at-risk (VaR), the quantile corresponding to the CVaR level. To mitigate this problem, the CVaR can be estimated by extrapolating above a lower threshold than the VaR using a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), which is often referred to as the peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. This method often requires a very high threshold to ﬁt well, leading to high variance in estimation, and can induce signiﬁcant bias if the threshold is chosen too low. In this paper, we address this bias-variance tradeoff by deriving a new expression for the GPD approximation error of the CVaR, a bias term induced by the choice of threshold, as well as a bias correction method for the estimated GPD parameters. This leads to the derivation of a new CVaR estimator that is asymptotically unbiased and less sensit-ive to lower thresholds being used. An asymptotic conﬁdence interval for the estimator is also con-structed. In a practical setting, we show through experiments that our estimator provides a signiﬁcant performance improvement compared with competing CVaR estimators in ﬁnite samples from heavy-tailed distributions",

    "abstract": "Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy. Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally, the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that our method is competitive with variational boosting and MCMC",

Conditional density models f ( y | x ) , where x represents potentially high-dimensional features, are an integral part of uncertainty quantiﬁcation in prediction and Bayesian inference.

While existing diagnostic tools can determine whether an approximated conditional density is compatible overall with a data sample, they lack a principled framework for identifying, locating, and interpreting the nature of statistically signiﬁcant discrepancies over the entire feature space. In this paper, we present rigorous and easy-to-interpret diagnostics such as (i) the \"Local Coverage Test\" (LCT), which distinguishes an arbitrarily misspeciﬁed model from the true conditional density of the sample, and (ii) \"Amortized Local P-P plots\" (ALP) which can quickly provide interpretable graphical summaries of distributional differences at any location x in the feature space.

Here policies are optimized by performing online learning on a sequence of loss functions that encourage the learner to mimic expert actions, and if the online learning has no regret, the agent can provably learn an expert-like policy. Online IL has demonstrated empirical successes in many applications and interestingly, its policy improvement speed observed in practice is usually much faster than existing theory suggests. In this work, we provide an explanation of this phenomenon. Let $\\xi$ denote the policy class bias and assume the online IL loss functions are convex, smooth, and non-negative. We prove that, after $N$ rounds of online IL with stochastic feedback, the policy improves in $\\tilde{O}(1/N + \\sqrt{\\xi/N})$ in both expectation and high probability. In other words, we show that adopting a sufficiently expressive policy class in online IL has two benefits: both the policy improvement speed increases and the performance bias decreases",

For instance, one might decide between inertial measurements or GPS to determine changepoints for motion. A Bayesian approach to changepoint detection is particularly appealing because we can represent our posterior uncertainty about changepoints and make active, cost-sensitive decisions about data ﬁdelity to re-duce this posterior uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered through active ﬁdelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data distribution. We propose a multi-ﬁdelity approach that makes cost-sensitive decisions about which data ﬁdelity to collect based on maximizing information gain with respect to changepoints.

We begin with a hardness result for the adversarial MDP problem: even for a horizon of 3, obtaining sublinear regret against the best non-stationary policy is NP -hard when both rewards and transitions are adversarial. This implies that convergence to even the weakest natural solution concept—normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium—is not possible via black-box reduction to a no-regret algorithm even in stochastic games with constant horizon (unless NP ⊆ BPP ). Instead, we turn to a different target: algorithms which generate an equilibrium when they are used by all players. Our main result is algorithm which generates an extensive-form correlated equilibrium, whose runtime is exponential in the horizon but polynomial in all other parameters. We give a similar algorithm which is polynomial in all parameters for \"fast-mixing\" stochastic games. We also show a method for efﬁciently reaching normal-form coarse correlated equilibria in \"single-controller\" stochastic games which follows the traditional no-regret approach.

    "abstract": "Node features and structural information of a graph are both crucial for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation problems. A variety of graph neural network (GNN) based approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, which typically determine output labels through feature aggregation. This can be problematic, as it implies conditional in-dependence of output nodes given hidden representations, despite their direct connections in the graph. To learn the direct inﬂuence among output nodes in a graph, we propose the E xplicit P airwise F actorized G raph N eural N etwork (EPFGNN), which models the whole graph as a partially observed Markov Random Field. It contains explicit pairwise factors to model output–output relations and uses a GNN backbone to model input–output relations. To balance model complexity and expres-sivity, the pairwise factors have a shared compo-nent and a separate scaling coefﬁcient for each edge. We apply the EM algorithm to train our model, and utilize a star-shaped piecewise likelihood for the tractable surrogate objective. We conduct experiments on various datasets, which shows that our model can effectively improve the performance for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation on graphs",

Despite multitude of empirical advances, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of different pruning methods. We inspect different pruning techniques under the statistical mechanics formulation of a teacher-student framework and derive their generalization error (GE) bounds. It has been shown that Determinantal Point Process (DPP) based node pruning method is notably superior to competing approaches when tested on real datasets. Using GE bounds in the aforementioned setup we provide theoretical guarantees for their empirical observations. Another consistent finding in literature is that sparse neural networks (edge pruned) generalize better than dense neural networks (node pruned) for a fixed number of parameters. We use our theoretical setup to prove this finding and show that even the baseline random edge pruning method performs better than the DPP node pruning method. We also validate this empirically on real datasets",

    "abstract": "Infinite width limits of deep neural networks often have tractable forms. They have been used to analyse the behaviour of finite networks, as well as being useful methods in their own right. When investigating infinitely wide convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it was observed that the correlations arising from spatial weight sharing disappear in the infinite limit. This is undesirable, as spatial correlation is the main motivation behind CNNs. We show that the loss of this property is not a consequence of the infinite limit, but rather of choosing an independent weight prior. Correlating the weights maintains the correlations in the activations. Varying the amount of correlation interpolates between independent-weight limits and mean-pooling. Empirical evaluation of the infinitely wide network shows that optimal performance is achieved between the extremes, indicating that correlations can be useful",

By recursively partitioning the covariate space and the output space, posterior inference in our model reduces to inference on single-output GP experts, which only need to be conditioned on a small subset of the observations.

Driven by a probabilistic formulation of minimum cost multicuts, we provide a measure for the uncertainties of the decisions made during the optimization. We argue that the access to such uncertainties is crucial for many practical applications and conduct an evaluation by means of sparsifications on three different, widely used datasets in the context of image decomposition (BSDS-500) and motion segmentation (DAVIS2016 and FBMS59) in terms of variation of information (VI) and Rand index (RI)",

Despite some promising recent advances in the topic, very little attention has been given to the problem of effectively learning PSDDs from data and logical constraints in large domains. In this paper, we show that a simple strategy of sampling and averaging PSDDs leads to state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. We overcome some of the issues with previous methods by employing a top-down generation of circuits from a logic formula represented as a BDD. We discuss how to lo-cally grow the circuit while achieving a good trade-off between complexity and goodness-of-ﬁt of the resulting model. Generalization error is further de-creased by aggregating sampled circuits through an ensemble of models.

    "abstract": "Conditional independence (CI) is a fundamental concept with wide applications in machine learning and causal inference. Although the problems of testing CI and estimating divergences have been extensively studied, the complementary problem of generating data that satisﬁes CI has received much less attention. A special case of the generation problem is to produce conditionally independent predictions. Given samples from an input data distribution, we formulate the problem of generating samples from a distribution that is close to the input distribution and satisﬁes CI. We establish a characterization of CI in terms of a general divergence identity. Based on one version of this identity, an architecture is proposed that leverages the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enforce CI in an end-to-end differentiable manner. As one illustration of the problem formulation and architecture, we consider applications to notions of fairness that can be written as CIs, speciﬁcally equalized odds and conditional statistical parity. We demonstrate conditionally independent prediction that trades off adherence to fairness criteria against classiﬁcation accuracy",

    "title": "Exact and approximate hierarchical clustering using A*",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering is a critical task in nu-merous domains. Many approaches are based on heuristics and the properties of the resulting clusterings are studied post hoc. However, in several applications, there is a natural cost function that can be used to characterize the quality of the clustering. In those cases, hierarchical clustering can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem. To that end, we introduce a new approach based on A* search. We overcome the prohibitively large search space by combining A* with a novel trellis data structure. This results in an exact algorithm that scales beyond previous state of the art (from a search space with 10 12 trees to 10 15 trees) and an approximate algorithm that improves over baselines, even in enormous search spaces (that contain more than 10 1000 trees). Empirically we demonstrate that our method achieves substantially higher quality results than baselines for a particle physics use case and other clustering benchmarks. We describe how our method provides signiﬁcantly improved theoretical bounds on the time and space complexity of A* for clustering",

However, algorithms for inference in nonparametric mixture models fail to meet two critical requirements for practical use: (1) that inference can be performed online, and (2) that inference is efﬁcient in the large time/sample limit. In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian recursion to efﬁciently infer a posterior distribution over discrete latent variables from a sequence of observations in an online manner, assuming a Chinese Restaurant Process prior on the sequence of latent variables. Our recursive ﬁlter, which we call the Recursive Chinese Restaurant Process (R-CRP), has quasilinear average time complexity and logarithmic average space complexity in the total number of observations.

    "abstract": "In many real-world scenarios, such as gene knockout experiments, targeted interventions are often accompanied by unknown interventions at off-target sites. Moreover, different units can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions, thereby creating a mixture of interventions. Identifying different components of this mixture can be very valuable in some applications. Motivated by such situations, in this work, we study the problem of identifying all components present in a mixture of interventions on a given causal Bayesian Network. We construct an example to show that, in general, the components are not identiﬁable from the mixture distribution. Next, assuming that the given network satisﬁes a positivity condition, we show that, if the set of mixture components satisfy a mild exclusion assumption, then they can be uniquely identiﬁed. Our proof gives an efﬁcient algorithm to recover these targets from the exponentially large search space of possible targets. In the more realistic scenario, where distributions are given via ﬁnitely many samples, we conduct a simulation study to analyze the performance of an algorithm derived from our identiﬁability proof",

The output layer of SDM-Net consists of both seen and unseen classes. To enable zero-shot learning, during training, we regularize the model such that the predicted distribution of unseen class is close in KL divergence to the distribution of similarities between the correct seen class and all the unseen classes.

We introduce a novel objective function that simultaneously accounts for fairness and stability and develop a layer-wise weight normalization using the Lipschitz constant to enhance neural message passing in GNNs. In doing so, we enforce fairness and stability both in the objective function as well as in the GNN architecture. Further, we show theoretically that our layer-wise weight normalization promotes counterfactual fairness and stability in the resulting representations.

Our ﬁrst contribu-tion is to formalize the problem in various settings, and explicitly discussing subtle aspects such as learner’s randomness and whether (or not) adversary’s attack can depend on it. We show that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the sample complexity, PAC learnability and certiﬁcation are achievable. In contrast, when the adversary’s budget grows linearly with the sample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss to one. We also study distribution-speciﬁc PAC learning in the same attack model and show that proper learning with certiﬁcation is possible for learning half spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the robustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning attacks.

Box models use regions which are products of intervals on [0 , 1] (i.e., \"boxes\"), representing joint probability distributions via Lebesgue measure. To mitigate issues with training, a recent work models the endpoints of these intervals using Gumbel distributions, chosen due to their min/max-stability. In this work we analyze min/max-stability on a bounded domain and provide a speciﬁc family of such distributions which, replacing Gumbel, allow for stochastic boxes embedded in a ﬁnite measure space. This allows for a latent noise model which is a probability measure.
