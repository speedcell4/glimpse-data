    "title": "Visual In-Context Prompting",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) has become a prevalent approach to improve zero-shot capabilities, but this idea is less explored in the vision domain. Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets. By joint training on COCO and SA-1B, our model achieves $57.7$ PQ on COCO and $23.2$ PQ on ADE20K. Code will be available at https://github.com/UX-Decoder/DINOv",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Methods for finetuning generative models for concept-driven personalization generally achieve strong results for subject-driven or style-driven generation. Recently, low-rank adaptations (LoRA) have been proposed as a parameter-efficient way of achieving concept-driven personalization. While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Feature alignment methods are used in many scientific disciplines for data pooling, annotation, and comparison. As an instance of a permutation learning problem, feature alignment presents significant statistical and computational challenges. In this work, we propose the covariance alignment model to study and compare various alignment methods and establish a minimax lower bound for covariance alignment that has a non-standard dimension scaling because of the presence of a nuisance parameter. This lower bound is in fact minimax optimal and is achieved by a natural quasi MLE. However, this estimator involves a search over all permutations which is computationally infeasible even when the problem has moderate size. To overcome this limitation, we show that the celebrated Gromov-Wasserstein algorithm from optimal transport which is more amenable to fast implementation even on large-scale problems is also minimax optimal. These results give the first statistical justification for the deployment of the Gromov-Wasserstein algorithm in practice",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) demonstrated remarkable capabilities in learning complex hierarchical data representations, but the nature of these representations remains largely unknown. Existing global explainability methods, such as Network Dissection, face limitations such as reliance on segmentation masks, lack of statistical significance testing, and high computational demands. We propose Inverse Recognition (INVERT), a scalable approach for connecting learned representations with human-understandable concepts by leveraging their capacity to discriminate between these concepts. In contrast to prior work, INVERT is capable of handling diverse types of neurons, exhibits less computational complexity, and does not rely on the availability of segmentation masks. Moreover, INVERT provides an interpretable metric assessing the alignment between the representation and its corresponding explanation and delivering a measure of statistical significance, emphasizing its utility and credibility. We demonstrate the applicability of INVERT in various scenarios, including the identification of representations affected by spurious correlations, and the interpretation of the hierarchical structure of decision-making within the models",

    "title": "Risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process and Learning under General Utility Functions",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations. Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework. Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration. In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward. We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design. We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward. When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity. In the absence of a simulator, our algorithm, designed with an upper-confidence-bound exploration approach, identifies a near-optimal policy while ensuring a guaranteed regret bound. For both algorithms, we match the theoretical lower bounds for the risk-neutral setting",

This widespread adoption of AI requires significant efforts in deploying these models in production environments. When hosting machine learning models for real-time predictions, it is important to meet defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs), ensuring reliability, minimal downtime, and optimizing operational costs of the underlying infrastructure. Large machine learning models often demand GPU resources for efficient inference to meet SLOs. In the context of these trends, there is growing interest in hosting AI models in a serverless architecture while still providing GPU access for inference tasks. This survey aims to summarize and categorize the emerging challenges and optimization opportunities for large-scale deep learning serving systems.

    "abstract": "We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly logconcave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm. Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Data sampling is an effective method to improve the training speed of neural networks, with recent results demonstrating that it can even break the neural scaling laws. These results critically rely on high-quality scores to estimate the importance of an input to the network. We observe that there are two dominant strategies: static sampling, where the scores are determined before training, and dynamic sampling, where the scores can depend on the model weights. Static algorithms are computationally inexpensive but less effective than their dynamic counterparts, which can cause end-to-end slowdown due to their need to explicitly compute losses. To address this problem, we propose a novel sampling distribution based on nonparametric kernel regression that learns an effective importance score as the neural network trains. However, nonparametric regression models are too computationally expensive to accelerate end-to-end training. Therefore, we develop an efficient sketch-based approximation to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Using recent techniques from high-dimensional statistics and randomized algorithms, we prove that our Nadaraya-Watson sketch approximates the estimator with exponential convergence guarantees. Our sampling algorithm outperforms the baseline in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy on four datasets",

    "title": "$Ï$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear principal component analysis",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Linear principal component analysis (PCA), nonlinear PCA, and linear independent component analysis (ICA) -- those are three methods with single-layer autoencoder formulations for learning linear transformations from data. Linear PCA learns orthogonal transformations (rotations) that orient axes to maximise variance, but it suffers from a subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to find a unique rotation for axes that share the same variance. Both nonlinear PCA and linear ICA reduce the subspace indeterminacy from rotational to permutational by maximising statistical independence under the assumption of unit variance. The main difference between them is that nonlinear PCA only learns rotations while linear ICA learns not just rotations but any linear transformation with unit variance. The relationship between all three can be understood by the singular value decomposition of the linear ICA transformation into a sequence of rotation, scale, rotation. Linear PCA learns the first rotation; nonlinear PCA learns the second. The scale is simply the inverse of the standard deviations. The problem is that, in contrast to linear PCA, conventional nonlinear PCA cannot be used directly on the data to learn the first rotation, the first being special as it reduces dimensionality and orders by variances. In this paper, we have identified the cause, and as a solution we propose $\\sigma$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear PCA as single-layer autoencoders. One of its key ingredients: modelling not just the rotation but also the scale -- the variances. This model bridges the disparity between linear and nonlinear PCA. And so, like linear PCA, it can learn a semi-orthogonal transformation that reduces dimensionality and orders by variances, but, unlike linear PCA, it does not suffer from rotational indeterminacy",

We use the Mapper algorithm to transform 3D digital rock images into graph datasets, encapsulating essential geometrical information.

Not only does it perform well on the test dataset, but it also maintains high prediction accuracy for unseen rocks and unexplored subcube sizes. Comparative analysis with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reveals the superior performance of GNNs in predicting unseen rock properties. Moreover, the graph representation of microstructures significantly reduces GPU memory requirements (compared to the grid representation for CNNs), enabling greater flexibility in the batch size selection. This work demonstrates the potential of GNN models in enhancing the prediction accuracy of rock properties and boosting the efficiency of digital rock analysis",

Similar to classical machine learning, an exact form of a quantum kernel is expected to have a great impact on the model performance. In this work we combine all trace-induced quantum kernels, including the commonly-used global fidelity and local projected quantum kernels, into a common framework. We show how generalized trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the fundamental building blocks we coin \"Lego\" kernels, which impose an inductive bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement shots. We show numerically that models based on local projected kernels can achieve comparable performance to the global fidelity quantum kernel.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m<n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests",

For the prediction, we formalize RAHT(1) linear prediction in MPEG-PCC in a theoretical framework, and propose a new nonlinear predictor using a polynomial of bilateral filter. We derive equations to efficiently compute the critically sampled high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$ amenable to encoding.

    "abstract": "Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs). Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps. In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans. However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \\textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs. ``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios. AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples. For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\\% improvement on GSM8K.

    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) plays a significant part in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems since it can provide empathetic services. Multimodal ERC can mitigate the drawbacks of uni-modal approaches. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in a variety of fields due to their superior performance in relation modeling. In multimodal ERC, GNNs are capable of extracting both long-distance contextual information and inter-modal interactive information. Unfortunately, since existing methods such as MMGCN directly fuse multiple modalities, redundant information may be generated and diverse information may be lost. In this work, we present a directed Graph based Cross-modal Feature Complementation (GraphCFC) module that can efficiently model contextual and interactive information. GraphCFC alleviates the problem of heterogeneity gap in multimodal fusion by utilizing multiple subspace extractors and Pair-wise Cross-modal Complementary (PairCC) strategy. We extract various types of edges from the constructed graph for encoding, thus enabling GNNs to extract crucial contextual and interactive information more accurately when performing message passing. Furthermore, we design a GNN structure called GAT-MLP, which can provide a new unified network framework for multimodal learning. The experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that our GraphCFC outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The convergence of many numerical optimization techniques is highly dependent on the initial guess given to the solver. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that utilizes tensor methods to initialize existing optimization solvers near global optima. Our method does not require access to a database of good solutions. We first transform the cost function, which depends on both task parameters and optimization variables, into a probability density function. Unlike existing approaches, the joint probability distribution of the task parameters and optimization variables is approximated using the Tensor Train model, which enables efficient conditioning and sampling. We treat the task parameters as random variables, and for a given task, we generate samples for decision variables from the conditional distribution to initialize the optimization solver. Our method can produce multiple solutions (when they exist) faster than existing methods. We first evaluate the approach on benchmark functions for numerical optimization that are hard to solve using gradient-based optimization solvers with a naive initialization. The results show that the proposed method can generate samples close to global optima and from multiple modes. We then demonstrate the generality and relevance of our framework to robotics by applying it to inverse kinematics with obstacles and motion planning problems with a 7-DoF manipulator",

    "abstract": "Language models for code such as CodeBERT offer the capability to learn advanced source code representation, but their opacity poses barriers to understanding of captured properties. Recent attention analysis studies provide initial interpretability insights by focusing solely on attention weights rather than considering the wider context modeling of Transformers. This study aims to shed some light on the previously ignored factors of the attention mechanism beyond the attention weights. We conduct an initial empirical study analyzing both attention distributions and transformed representations in CodeBERT. Across two programming languages, Java and Python, we find that the scaled transformation norms of the input better capture syntactic structure compared to attention weights alone. Our analysis reveals characterization of how CodeBERT embeds syntactic code properties. The findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating factors beyond just attention weights for rigorously understanding neural code models. This lays the groundwork for developing more interpretable models and effective uses of attention mechanisms in program analysis",

    "abstract": "Motor impairments, frequently caused by neurological incidents like strokes or traumatic brain injuries, present substantial obstacles in rehabilitation therapy. This research aims to elevate the field by optimizing motor imagery classification algorithms within Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). By improving the efficiency of BCIs, we offer a novel approach that holds significant promise for enhancing motor rehabilitation outcomes. Utilizing unsupervised techniques for dimensionality reduction, namely Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) coupled with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we evaluate the necessity of employing supervised methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification tasks. Importantly, participants who exhibited high KNN scores following UMAP dimensionality reduction also achieved high accuracy in supervised deep learning (DL) models. Due to individualized model requirements and massive neural training data, dimensionality reduction becomes an effective preprocessing step that minimizes the need for extensive data labeling and supervised deep learning techniques. This approach has significant implications not only for targeted therapies in motor dysfunction but also for addressing regulatory, safety, and reliability concerns in the rapidly evolving BCI field",

    "title": "Bitformer: An efficient Transformer with bitwise operation-based attention for Big Data Analytics at low-cost low-precision devices",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In the current landscape of large models, the Transformer stands as a cornerstone, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern models. However, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial computational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its reliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles, particularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing environments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices and a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions. To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we introduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer paradigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that adeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise operations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does it maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range information dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the computational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition from an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an $O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this advantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller than the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$. The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable requirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge computing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between high-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a promising trajectory for further advancements in the field",

Written records often reflect bias, and once bias is identified; it is possible to refer individuals for training to reduce bias. Many machine learning tools exist to explore text data and create predictive models that can search written records to identify real-time bias. However, few previous studies investigate large language model embeddings and geometric models of biased text data to understand geometry's impact on bias modeling accuracy. To overcome this issue, this study utilizes the RedditBias database to analyze textual biases. Four transformer models, including BERT and RoBERTa variants, were explored. Post-embedding, t-SNE allowed two-dimensional visualization of data. KNN classifiers differentiated bias types, with lower k-values proving more effective. Findings suggest BERT, particularly mini BERT, excels in bias classification, while multilingual models lag.

    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become a significant technology in natural language processing through extensive research and development. However, the deficiency of high-quality bilingual language pair data still poses a major challenge to improving NMT performance. Recent studies have been exploring the use of contextual information from pre-trained language model (PLM) to address this problem. Yet, the issue of incompatibility between PLM and NMT model remains unresolved. This study proposes PLM-integrated NMT (PiNMT) model to overcome the identified problems. PiNMT model consists of three critical components, PLM Multi Layer Converter, Embedding Fusion, and Cosine Alignment, each playing a vital role in providing effective PLM information to NMT. Furthermore, two training strategies, Separate Learning Rates and Dual Step Training, are also introduced in this paper. By implementing the proposed PiNMT model and training strategy, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the IWSLT'14 En$\\leftrightarrow$De dataset.

Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic and radiotherapy (RT) planning tool, offering detailed insights into the anatomy of the human body. The extensive scan time is stressful for patients, who must remain motionless in a prolonged imaging procedure that prioritizes reduction of imaging artifacts. This is challenging for pediatric patients who may require measures for managing voluntary motions such as anesthesia. Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements. DeepMRIRec reduced scanning time by a factor of four producing a structural similarity score surpassing the evaluated state-of-the-art method (0.960 vs 0.896), thereby demonstrating its potential for accelerating MRI scanning for RT planning",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Formality plays a significant role in language communication, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages utilise formal and informal expressions to convey messages based on social contexts and relationships. When a language translation technique is used to translate from a source language that does not pertain the formality (e.g. English) to a target language that does, there is a missing information on formality that could be a challenge in producing an accurate outcome. This research explores how this issue should be resolved when machine learning methods are used to translate from English to languages with formality, using Hindi as the example data. This was done by training a bilingual model in a formality-controlled setting and comparing its performance with a pre-trained multilingual model in a similar setting. Since there are not a lot of training data with ground truth, automated annotation techniques were employed to increase the data size. The primary modeling approach involved leveraging transformer models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the official formality accuracy(ACC) by comparing the predicted masked tokens with the ground truth. This metric provides a quantitative measure of how well the translations align with the desired outputs. Our study showcases a versatile translation strategy that considers the nuances of formality in the target language, catering to diverse language communication needs and scenarios",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Quantization is commonly used in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to reduce the storage and computational complexity by decreasing the arithmetical precision of activations and weights, a.k.a. tensors. Efficient hardware architectures employ linear quantization to enable the deployment of recent DNNs onto embedded systems and mobile devices. However, linear uniform quantization cannot usually reduce the numerical precision to less than 8 bits without sacrificing high performance in terms of model accuracy. The performance loss is due to the fact that tensors do not follow uniform distributions. In this paper, we show that a significant amount of tensors fit into an exponential distribution. Then, we propose DNA-TEQ to exponentially quantize DNN tensors with an adaptive scheme that achieves the best trade-off between numerical precision and accuracy loss. The experimental results show that DNA-TEQ provides a much lower quantization bit-width compared to previous proposals, resulting in an average compression ratio of 40% over the linear INT8 baseline, with negligible accuracy loss and without retraining the DNNs. Besides, DNA-TEQ leads the way in performing dot-product operations in the exponential domain, which saves 66% of energy consumption on average for a set of widely used DNNs",

We propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to identifying the most preferred solution in the MOO with expensive objective functions, in which a Bayesian preference model of the DM is adaptively estimated by an interactive manner based on the two types of supervisions called the pairwise preference and improvement request. To explore the most preferred solution, we define an acquisition function in which the uncertainty both in the objective functions and the DM preference is incorporated. Further, to minimize the interaction cost with the DM, we also propose an active learning strategy for the preference estimation.

In particular, we establish an isometry between such parameterizations in terms of a generalization of the Hilbert log cross-ratio simplex distance to a tempered Hilbert co-simplex distance. Similar to the Hilbert geometry, the tempered Hilbert distance is characterized as a $t$-symmetrization of the oriented tempered Funk distance. We motivate our construction by introducing the notion of $t$-lengths of smooth curves in a tautological Finsler manifold.

    "abstract": "Learning style refers to a type of training mechanism adopted by an individual to gain new knowledge. As suggested by the VARK model, humans have different learning preferences, like Visual (V), Auditory (A), Read/Write (R), and Kinesthetic (K), for acquiring and effectively processing information. Our work endeavors to leverage this concept of knowledge diversification to improve the performance of model compression techniques like Knowledge Distillation (KD) and Mutual Learning (ML). Consequently, we use a single-teacher and two-student network in a unified framework that not only allows for the transfer of knowledge from teacher to students (KD) but also encourages collaborative learning between students (ML). Unlike the conventional approach, where the teacher shares the same knowledge in the form of predictions or feature representations with the student network, our proposed approach employs a more diversified strategy by training one student with predictions and the other with feature maps from the teacher. We further extend this knowledge diversification by facilitating the exchange of predictions and feature maps between the two student networks, enriching their learning experiences. We have conducted comprehensive experiments with three benchmark datasets for both classification and segmentation tasks using two different network architecture combinations. These experimental results demonstrate that knowledge diversification in a combined KD and ML framework outperforms conventional KD or ML techniques (with similar network configuration) that only use predictions with an average improvement of 2%. Furthermore, consistent improvement in performance across different tasks, with various network architectures, and over state-of-the-art techniques establishes the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We study private empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem for losses satisfying the $(\\gamma,\\kappa)$-Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition. The Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition is a special case of this condition when $\\kappa=2$. Specifically, we study this problem under the constraint of $\\rho$ zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). When $\\kappa\\in[1,2]$ and the loss function is Lipschitz and smooth over a sufficiently large region, we provide a new algorithm based on variance reduced gradient descent that achieves the rate $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^\\kappa\\big)$ on the excess empirical risk, where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension. We further show that this rate is nearly optimal. When $\\kappa \\geq 2$ and the loss is instead Lipschitz and weakly convex, we show it is possible to achieve the rate $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^\\kappa\\big)$ with a private implementation of the proximal point method. When the KL parameters are unknown, we provide a novel modification and analysis of the noisy gradient descent algorithm and show that this algorithm achieves a rate of $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^{\\frac{2\\kappa}{4-\\kappa}}\\big)$ adaptively, which is nearly optimal when $\\kappa = 2$. We further show that, without assuming the KL condition, the same gradient descent algorithm can achieve fast convergence to a stationary point when the gradient stays sufficiently large during the run of the algorithm. Specifically, we show that this algorithm can approximate stationary points of Lipschitz, smooth (and possibly nonconvex) objectives with rate as fast as $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)$ and never worse than $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^{1/2}\\big)$. The latter rate matches the best known rate for methods that do not rely on variance reduction",

    "title": "Transfer Attacks and Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Tasks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as code2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, such as the inclusion of \"dead code\" through false conditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to \"fool\" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of adversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code models, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such adversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based defenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information such as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for reversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial examples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening the LLMs' performance. The proposed defenses show promise in improving the model's resilience, paving the way to more robust defensive solutions for LLMs in code-related applications",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Classifier-free guidance is a key component for improving the performance of conditional generative models for many downstream tasks. It drastically improves the quality of samples produced, but has so far only been used for diffusion models. Flow Matching (FM), an alternative simulation-free approach, trains Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs) based on regressing vector fields. It remains an open question whether classifier-free guidance can be performed for Flow Matching models, and to what extent does it improve performance. In this paper, we explore the usage of Guided Flows for a variety of downstream applications involving conditional image generation, speech synthesis, and reinforcement learning. In particular, we are the first to apply flow models to the offline reinforcement learning setting. We also show that Guided Flows significantly improves the sample quality in image generation and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis, and can make use of drastically low amounts of computation without affecting the agent's overall performance",

Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the initialization challenges and sparse data issues inherent in cyclic shear strain loads are addressed in the RNN models. A mean-field model generates a comprehensive data set representing elasto-plastic behavior. In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strain histories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source task and cyclic loading conditions as the target task. Incorporating sub-scale properties enhances RNN versatility. In order to achieve accurate predictions, the model uses a grid search method to tune network architecture and hyper-parameter configurations. The results of this study demonstrate that transfer learning can be used to effectively adapt the RNN to varying strain conditions, which establishes its potential as a useful tool for modeling path-dependent responses in woven composites",

    "abstract": "Working with multiple variables they usually contain difficult to control complex dependencies. This article proposes extraction of their individual information, e.g. $\\overline{X|Y}$ as random variable containing information from $X$, but with removed information about $Y$, by using $(x,y) \\leftrightarrow (\\bar{x}=\\textrm{CDF}_{X|Y=y}(x),y)$ reversible normalization. One application can be decoupling of individual information of variables: reversibly transform $(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)\\leftrightarrow(\\tilde{X}_1,\\ldots \\tilde{X}_n)$ together containing the same information, but being independent: $\\forall_{i\\neq j} \\tilde{X}_i\\perp \\tilde{X}_j, \\tilde{X}_i\\perp X_j$. It requires detailed models of complex conditional probability distributions - it is generally a difficult task, but here can be done through multiple dependency reducing iterations, using imperfect methods (here HCR: Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction). It could be also used for direct mutual information - evaluating direct information transfer: without use of intermediate variables. For causality direction there is discussed multi-feature Granger causality, e.g. to trace various types of individual information transfers between such decoupled variables, including propagation time (delay)",

    "title": "From Principle to Practice: Vertical Data Minimization for Machine Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Aiming to train and deploy predictive models, organizations collect large amounts of detailed client data, risking the exposure of private information in the event of a breach. To mitigate this, policymakers increasingly demand compliance with the data minimization (DM) principle, restricting data collection to only that data which is relevant and necessary for the task. Despite regulatory pressure, the problem of deploying machine learning models that obey DM has so far received little attention. In this work, we address this challenge in a comprehensive manner. We propose a novel vertical DM (vDM) workflow based on data generalization, which by design ensures that no full-resolution client data is collected during training and deployment of models, benefiting client privacy by reducing the attack surface in case of a breach. We formalize and study the corresponding problem of finding generalizations that both maximize data utility and minimize empirical privacy risk, which we quantify by introducing a diverse set of policy-aligned adversarial scenarios. Finally, we propose a range of baseline vDM algorithms, as well as Privacy-aware Tree (PAT), an especially effective vDM algorithm that outperforms all baselines across several settings. We plan to release our code as a publicly available library, helping advance the standardization of DM for machine learning. Overall, we believe our work can help lay the foundation for further exploration and adoption of DM principles in real-world applications",

    "title": "Confident Naturalness Explanation (CNE): A Framework to Explain and Assess Patterns Forming Naturalness",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Protected natural areas are regions that have been minimally affected by human activities such as urbanization, agriculture, and other human interventions. To better understand and map the naturalness of these areas, machine learning models can be used to analyze satellite imagery. Specifically, explainable machine learning methods show promise in uncovering patterns that contribute to the concept of naturalness within these protected environments. Additionally, addressing the uncertainty inherent in machine learning models is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of this concept. However, existing approaches have limitations. They either fail to provide explanations that are both valid and objective or struggle to offer a quantitative metric that accurately measures the contribution of specific patterns to naturalness, along with the associated confidence. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called the Confident Naturalness Explanation (CNE) framework. This framework combines explainable machine learning and uncertainty quantification to assess and explain naturalness. We introduce a new quantitative metric that describes the confident contribution of patterns to the concept of naturalness. Furthermore, we generate an uncertainty-aware segmentation mask for each input sample, highlighting areas where the model lacks knowledge. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we apply it to a study site in Fennoscandia using two open-source satellite datasets",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The gameplay of strategic board games such as chess, Go and Hex is often characterized by combinatorial, relational structures -- capturing distinct interactions and non-local patterns -- and not just images. Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Navigating the challenges of data-driven speech processing, one of the primary hurdles is accessing reliable pathological speech data. While public datasets appear to offer solutions, they come with inherent risks of potential unintended exposure of patient health information via re-identification attacks. Using a comprehensive real-world pathological speech corpus, with over n=3,800 test subjects spanning various age groups and speech disorders, we employed a deep-learning-driven automatic speaker verification (ASV) approach. This resulted in a notable mean equal error rate (EER) of 0.89% with a standard deviation of 0.06%, outstripping traditional benchmarks. Our comprehensive assessments demonstrate that pathological speech overall faces heightened privacy breach risks compared to healthy speech. Specifically, adults with dysphonia are at heightened re-identification risks, whereas conditions like dysarthria yield results comparable to those of healthy speakers. Crucially, speech intelligibility does not influence the ASV system's performance metrics. In pediatric cases, particularly those with cleft lip and palate, the recording environment plays a decisive role in re-identification. Merging data across pathological types led to a marked EER decrease, suggesting the potential benefits of pathological diversity in ASV, accompanied by a logarithmic boost in ASV effectiveness. In essence, this research sheds light on the dynamics between pathological speech and speaker verification, emphasizing its crucial role in safeguarding patient confidentiality in our increasingly digitized healthcare era",

We study regression from images to parameter values and here it is common to detect uncertainty by predicting probability distributions. In this context, we investigate the regression-by-classification paradigm which can represent multimodal distributions, without a prior assumption on the number of modes. Through experiments on a specifically designed synthetic dataset, we demonstrate that traditional loss functions lead to poor probability distribution estimates and severe overconfidence, in the absence of full ground truth distributions. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose hinge-Wasserstein -- a simple improvement of the Wasserstein loss that reduces the penalty for weak secondary modes during training. This enables prediction of complex distributions with multiple modes, and allows training on datasets where full ground truth distributions are not available. In extensive experiments, we show that the proposed loss leads to substantially better uncertainty estimation on two challenging computer vision tasks: horizon line detection and stereo disparity estimation",

Here we apply a recent development in the theory of feature learning, the adaptive kernel approach, to two teacher-student models with cubic-polynomial and modular addition teachers. We provide analytical predictions on feature learning and Grokking properties of these models and demonstrate a mapping between Grokking and the theory of phase transitions. We show that after Grokking, the state of the DNN is analogous to the mixed phase following a first-order phase transition. In this mixed phase, the DNN generates useful internal representations of the teacher that are sharply distinct from those before the transition",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models, not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS use structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieve computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) leveraging simple math to re-arrange the order of operations in REDS computational graph to take advantage of the data cache. REDS support conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provide computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on six benchmark architectures trained on the Google Speech Commands, FMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence for REDS outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\\mu$s, utilizing a 2-layer fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense",

Prior works on time series diffusion models have primarily focused on developing conditional models tailored to specific forecasting or imputation tasks. In this work, we explore the potential of task-agnostic, unconditional diffusion models for several time series applications. We propose TSDiff, an unconditionally-trained diffusion model for time series. Our proposed self-guidance mechanism enables conditioning TSDiff for downstream tasks during inference, without requiring auxiliary networks or altering the training procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three different time series tasks: forecasting, refinement, and synthetic data generation. First, we show that TSDiff is competitive with several task-specific conditional forecasting methods (predict). Second, we leverage the learned implicit probability density of TSDiff to iteratively refine the predictions of base forecasters with reduced computational overhead over reverse diffusion (refine). Notably, the generative performance of the model remains intact -- downstream forecasters trained on synthetic samples from TSDiff outperform forecasters that are trained on samples from other state-of-the-art generative time series models, occasionally even outperforming models trained on real data (synthesize)",

    "title": "MergeSFL: Split Federated Learning with Feature Merging and Batch Size Regulation",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular technique for edge AI to mine valuable knowledge in edge computing (EC) systems. To mitigate the computing/communication burden on resource-constrained workers and protect model privacy, split federated learning (SFL) has been released by integrating both data and model parallelism. Despite resource limitations, SFL still faces two other critical challenges in EC, i.e., statistical heterogeneity and system heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SFL framework, termed MergeSFL, by incorporating feature merging and batch size regulation in SFL. Concretely, feature merging aims to merge the features from workers into a mixed feature sequence, which is approximately equivalent to the features derived from IID data and is employed to promote model accuracy. While batch size regulation aims to assign diverse and suitable batch sizes for heterogeneous workers to improve training efficiency. Moreover, MergeSFL explores to jointly optimize these two strategies upon their coupled relationship to better enhance the performance of SFL. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical platform with 80 NVIDIA Jetson edge devices, and the experimental results show that MergeSFL can improve the final model accuracy by 5.82% to 26.22%, with a speedup by about 1.74x to 4.14x, compared to the baselines",

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference can quantify uncertainty in the predictions of neural networks using posterior distributions for model parameters and network output. By looking at these posterior distributions, one can separate the origin of uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic contributions. One goal of uncertainty quantification is to inform on prediction accuracy. Here we show that prediction accuracy depends on both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in an intricate fashion that cannot be understood in terms of marginalized uncertainty distributions alone. How the accuracy relates to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties depends not only on the model architecture, but also on the properties of the dataset. We discuss the significance of these results for active learning and introduce a novel acquisition function that outperforms common uncertainty-based methods. To arrive at our results, we approximated the posteriors using deep ensembles, for fully-connected, convolutional and attention-based neural networks",

    "title": "Counterfactual Explanation for Regression via Disentanglement in Latent Space",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) help address the question: How can the factors that influence the prediction of a predictive model be changed to achieve a more favorable outcome from a user's perspective? Thus, they bear the potential to guide the user's interaction with AI systems since they represent easy-to-understand explanations. To be applicable, CEs need to be realistic and actionable. In the literature, various methods have been proposed to generate CEs. However, the majority of research on CEs focuses on classification problems where questions like \"What should I do to get my rejected loan approved?\" are raised. In practice, answering questions like \"What should I do to increase my salary?\" are of a more regressive nature. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to generate CEs for a pre-trained regressor by first disentangling the label-relevant from the label-irrelevant dimensions in the latent space. CEs are then generated by combining the label-irrelevant dimensions and the predefined output. The intuition behind this approach is that the ideal counterfactual search should focus on the label-irrelevant characteristics of the input and suggest changes toward target-relevant characteristics. Searching in the latent space could help achieve this goal. We show that our method maintains the characteristics of the query sample during the counterfactual search. In various experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive based on different quality measures on image and tabular datasets in regression problem settings. It efficiently returns results closer to the original data manifold compared to three state-of-the-art methods, which is essential for realistic high-dimensional machine learning applications.

    "abstract": "While deep learning has achieved remarkable success, there is no clear explanation about why it works so well. In order to discuss this question quantitatively, we need a mathematical framework that explains what learning is in the first place. After several considerations, we succeeded in constructing a mathematical framework that can provide a unified understanding of all types of learning, including deep learning and learning in the brain. We call it learning principle, and it follows that all learning is equivalent to estimating the probability of input data. We not only derived this principle, but also mentioned its application to actual machine learning models. For example, we found that conventional supervised learning is equivalent to estimating conditional probabilities, and succeeded in making supervised learning more effective and generalized. We also proposed a new method of defining the values of estimated probability using differentiation, and showed that unsupervised learning can be performed on arbitrary dataset without any prior knowledge. Namely, this method is a general-purpose machine learning in the true sense. Moreover, we succeeded in describing the learning mechanism in the brain by considering the time evolution of a fully or partially connected model and applying this new method.

Our findings reveal that curriculum learning should be considered a novel direction in improving control-task performance over complex time-series. Our ample random-seed out-sample empirics and ablation studies are highly encouraging for curriculum learning for time-series control. These findings are especially encouraging as we tune all overlapping hyperparameters on the baseline -- giving an advantage to the baseline.

In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Automated blood vessel segmentation is vital for biomedical imaging, as vessel changes indicate many pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Test Time Adaptation (TTA) is a pivotal concept in machine learning, enabling models to perform well in real-world scenarios, where test data distribution differs from training. In this work, we propose a novel approach called pseudo Source guided Target Clustering (pSTarC) addressing the relatively unexplored area of TTA under real-world domain shifts. This method draws inspiration from target clustering techniques and exploits the source classifier for generating pseudo-source samples. The test samples are strategically aligned with these pseudo-source samples, facilitating their clustering and thereby enhancing TTA performance. pSTarC operates solely within the fully test-time adaptation protocol, removing the need for actual source data. Experimental validation on a variety of domain shift datasets, namely VisDA, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, CIFAR-100C verifies pSTarC's effectiveness. This method exhibits significant improvements in prediction accuracy along with efficient computational requirements. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the universality of the pSTarC framework by showing its effectiveness for the continuous TTA framework.

    "abstract": "Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for goal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and transferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as they require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously discovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical information, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a developmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that abstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar roles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns both the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses symbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the transition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation. We evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned representation is interpretable, transferrable and results in data efficient learning",

    "abstract": "A popular perspective in Reinforcement learning (RL) casts the problem as probabilistic inference on a graphical model of the Markov decision process (MDP). The core object of study is the probability of each state-action pair being visited under the optimal policy. Previous approaches to approximate this quantity can be arbitrarily poor, leading to algorithms that do not implement genuine statistical inference and consequently do not perform well in challenging problems. In this work, we undertake a rigorous Bayesian treatment of the posterior probability of state-action optimality and clarify how it flows through the MDP. We first reveal that this quantity can indeed be used to generate a policy that explores efficiently, as measured by regret. Unfortunately, computing it is intractable, so we derive a new variational Bayesian approximation yielding a tractable convex optimization problem and establish that the resulting policy also explores efficiently. We call our approach VAPOR and show that it has strong connections to Thompson sampling, K-learning, and maximum entropy exploration.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Hydropower plants are crucial for stable renewable energy and serve as vital water sources for sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation. This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts",

Using the BigIdeasLab_STEP dataset, which includes heart rate time series annotated with specific tasks performed by individuals, we sought to determine if general classification was achievable. Our analyses showed that the accuracy is sensitive to the choice of window/stride size. Moreover, we found variable classification performances between subjects due to differences in the physical structure of their hearts. Various techniques were used to minimize this variability. First of all, normalization proved to be a crucial step and significantly improved the performance. Secondly, grouping subjects and performing classification inside a group helped to improve performance and decrease inter-subject variability. Finally, we show that including handcrafted features as input to a deep learning (DL) network improves the classification performance further. Together, these findings indicate that heart rate time series can be utilized for classification tasks like predicting activity. However, normalization or grouping techniques need to be chosen carefully to minimize the issue of subject variability",

Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models.

    "abstract": "In the field of equation learning, exhaustively considering all possible equations derived from a basis function dictionary is infeasible. Sparse regression and greedy algorithms have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this challenge. However, the presence of multicollinearity poses difficulties for sparse regression techniques, and greedy steps may inadvertently exclude terms of the true equation, leading to reduced identification accuracy. In this article, we present an approach that strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency in equation learning. Inspired by stepwise regression, our approach combines the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, and the Bayesian model evidence, $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$, in a novel way. Our procedure is characterized by a comprehensive search with just a minor reduction of the model space at each iteration step. With two flavors of our approach and the adoption of $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$ for bi-directional stepwise regression, we present a total of three new avenues for equation learning. Through three extensive numerical experiments involving random polynomials and dynamical systems, we compare our approach against four state-of-the-art methods and two standard approaches. The results demonstrate that our comprehensive search approach surpasses all other methods in terms of identification accuracy. In particular, the second flavor of our approach establishes an efficient overfitting penalty solely based on $R^2$, which achieves highest rates of exact equation recovery",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited performance in structural knowledge extraction, such as relations between objects. In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "title": "Towards Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA$^2$ in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Our code will be made publicly available",

    "abstract": "In Byzantine robust distributed or federated learning, a central server wants to train a machine learning model over data distributed across multiple workers. However, a fraction of these workers may deviate from the prescribed algorithm and send arbitrary messages. While this problem has received significant attention recently, most current defenses assume that the workers have identical data. For realistic cases when the data across workers are heterogeneous (non-iid), we design new attacks which circumvent current defenses, leading to significant loss of performance. We then propose a simple bucketing scheme that adapts existing robust algorithms to heterogeneous datasets at a negligible computational cost. We also theoretically and experimentally validate our approach, showing that combining bucketing with existing robust algorithms is effective against challenging attacks. Our work is the first to establish guaranteed convergence for the non-iid Byzantine robust problem under realistic assumptions",

    "title": "On sampling determinantal and Pfaffian point processes on a quantum computer",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "DPPs were introduced by Macchi as a model in quantum optics the 1970s. Since then, they have been widely used as models and subsampling tools in statistics and computer science. Most applications require sampling from a DPP, and given their quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a quantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over a finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of $\\{1,\\dots,N\\}$ parametrized by an $N\\times N$ Hermitian kernel matrix. Vanilla sampling consists in two steps, of respective costs $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(Nr^2)$ operations on a classical computer, where $r$ is the rank of the kernel matrix. A large first part of the current paper consists in explaining why the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation of fermionic systems already yields quantum DPP sampling algorithms. We then modify existing quantum circuits, and discuss their insertion in a full DPP sampling pipeline that starts from practical kernel specifications. The bottom line is that, with $P$ (classical) parallel processors, we can divide the preprocessing cost by $P$ and build a quantum circuit with $\\mathcal{O}(Nr)$ gates that sample a given DPP, with depth varying from $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r\\log N)$ depending on qubit-communication constraints on the target machine. We also connect existing work on the simulation of superconductors to Pfaffian point processes, which generalize DPPs and would be a natural addition to the machine learner's toolbox. In particular, we describe \"projective\" Pfaffian point processes, the cardinality of which has constant parity, almost surely. Finally, the circuits are empirically validated on a classical simulator and on 5-qubit IBM machines",

In this work, we will propose a non-targeted Hard Label Black Box Node Injection Attack on Graph Neural Networks, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Under this setting, more real world tasks can be studied because our attack assumes no prior knowledge about (1): the model architecture of the GNN we are attacking; (2): the model's gradients; (3): the output logits of the target GNN model. Our attack is based on an existing edge perturbation attack, from which we restrict the optimization process to formulate a node injection attack.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recently, a large number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites have been launched and deployed successfully in space by commercial companies, such as SpaceX. Due to multimodal sensors equipped by the LEO satellites, they serve not only for communication but also for various machine learning applications, such as space modulation recognition, remote sensing image classification, etc. However, the ground station (GS) may be incapable of downloading such a large volume of raw sensing data for centralized model training due to the limited contact time with LEO satellites (e.g. 5 minutes). Therefore, federated learning (FL) has emerged as the promising solution to address this problem via on-device training. Unfortunately, to enable FL on LEO satellites, we still face three critical challenges that are i) heterogeneous computing and memory capabilities, ii) limited uplink rate, and iii) model staleness. To this end, we propose FedSN as a general FL framework to tackle the above challenges, and fully explore data diversity on LEO satellites. Specifically, we first present a novel sub-structure scheme to enable heterogeneous local model training considering different computing, memory, and communication constraints on LEO satellites. Additionally, we propose a pseudo-synchronous model aggregation strategy to dynamically schedule model aggregation for compensating model staleness. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedSN, we evaluate it using space modulation recognition and remote sensing image classification tasks by leveraging the data from real-world satellite networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedSN framework achieves higher accuracy, lower computing, and communication overhead than the state-of-the-art benchmarks and the effectiveness of each components in FedSN",

We implement a method that allows for producing functions with given inputs as minima. We find that increasing the number of minima degrades ICL performance.

    "title": "Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various applications. Existing frameworks utilize CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments to train GNN models and integrate mini-batch and sampling techniques to overcome the GPU memory limitation. In CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments, we can divide sample-based GNN training into three steps: sample, gather, and train. Existing GNN systems use different task orchestrating methods to employ each step on CPU or GPU. After extensive experiments and analysis, we find that existing task orchestrating methods fail to fully utilize the heterogeneous resources, limited by inefficient CPU processing or GPU resource contention. In this paper, we propose NeutronOrch, a system for sample-based GNN training that incorporates a layer-based task orchestrating method and ensures balanced utilization of the CPU and GPU. NeutronOrch decouples the training process by layer and pushes down the training task of the bottom layer to the CPU. This significantly reduces the computational load and memory footprint of GPU training. To avoid inefficient CPU processing, NeutronOrch only offloads the training of frequently accessed vertices to the CPU and lets GPU reuse their embeddings with bounded staleness. Furthermore, NeutronOrch provides a fine-grained pipeline design for the layer-based task orchestrating method, fully overlapping different tasks on heterogeneous resources while strictly guaranteeing bounded staleness. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GNN systems, NeutronOrch can achieve up to 4.61x performance speedup",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Differentially private GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) have been recently studied to provide high accuracy in various tasks on graph data while strongly protecting user privacy. In particular, a recent study proposes an algorithm to protect each user's feature vector in an attributed graph with LDP (Local Differential Privacy), a strong privacy notion without a trusted third party. However, this algorithm does not protect edges (friendships) in a social graph, hence cannot protect user privacy in unattributed graphs. How to provide strong privacy with high accuracy in unattributed graphs remains open. In this paper, we propose a novel LDP algorithm called the DPRR (Degree-Preserving Randomized Response) to provide LDP for edges in GNNs. Our DPRR preserves each user's degree hence a graph structure while providing edge LDP. Technically, our DPRR uses Warner's RR (Randomized Response) and strategic edge sampling, where each user's sampling probability is automatically tuned using the Laplacian mechanism to preserve the degree information under edge LDP. We also propose a privacy budget allocation method to make the noise in both Warner's RR and the Laplacian mechanism small. We focus on graph classification as a task of GNNs and evaluate the DPRR using three social graph datasets. Our experimental results show that the DPRR significantly outperforms three baselines and provides accuracy close to a non-private algorithm in all datasets with a reasonable privacy budget, e.g., epsilon=1",

    "abstract": "Score distillation sampling (SDS) has shown great promise in text-to-3D generation by distilling pretrained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, but suffers from over-saturation, over-smoothing, and low-diversity problems. In this work, we propose to model the 3D parameter as a random variable instead of a constant as in SDS and present variational score distillation (VSD), a principled particle-based variational framework to explain and address the aforementioned issues in text-to-3D generation. We show that SDS is a special case of VSD and leads to poor samples with both small and large CFG weights. In comparison, VSD works well with various CFG weights as ancestral sampling from diffusion models and simultaneously improves the diversity and sample quality with a common CFG weight (i.e., $7.5$). We further present various improvements in the design space for text-to-3D such as distillation time schedule and density initialization, which are orthogonal to the distillation algorithm yet not well explored. Our overall approach, dubbed ProlificDreamer, can generate high rendering resolution (i.e., $512\\times512$) and high-fidelity NeRF with rich structure and complex effects (e.g., smoke and drops). Further, initialized from NeRF, meshes fine-tuned by VSD are meticulously detailed and photo-realistic. Project page and codes: https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/prolificdreamer/",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a promising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three) to generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account the sequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems often depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially low relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance at the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show that our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two real-world datasets across ten different domains",

    "abstract": "Algorithm selection aims to identify the most suitable algorithm for solving a specific problem before execution, which has become a critical process of the AutoML. Current mainstream algorithm selection techniques rely heavily on feature representations of various problems and employ the performance of each algorithm as supervised information. However, there is a significant research gap concerning the consideration of algorithm features. This gap is primarily attributed to the inherent complexity of algorithms, making it particularly challenging to find a universally effective feature extraction method that is applicable across a diverse range of algorithms. Unfortunately, neglecting this aspect undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of algorithm selection and indirectly necessitates an increased volume of problem data for training purposes. This paper takes a significant stride towards addressing this gap by proposing an approach that integrates algorithm representation into the algorithm selection process. Specifically, our proposed model employs distinct modules to extract representations of both problems and algorithms, where the algorithm representation leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in the realm of code comprehension. Following the extraction of embedding vectors for both algorithms and problems, the most suitable algorithm is determined through calculations of matching degrees. Our experiments not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also showcase the performance of different embedded pre-trained LLMs, which suggests that the proposed algorithm selection framework holds the potential to serve as a baseline task for evaluating the code representation capabilities of LLMs",

In this paper, we propose EdgeFM, a novel edge-cloud cooperative system with open-set recognition capability. EdgeFM selectively uploads unlabeled data to query the FM on the cloud and customizes the specific knowledge and architectures for edge models. Meanwhile, EdgeFM conducts dynamic model switching at run-time taking into account both data uncertainty and dynamic network variations, which ensures the accuracy always close to the original FM. We implement EdgeFM using two FMs on two edge platforms. We evaluate EdgeFM on three public datasets and two self-collected datasets.

We consider high-dimensional and linear settings where the reward function of the bandit model admits either a sparse or low-rank structure and ask how small a number of batches are needed for a comparable performance with fully dynamic data in which $L = T$. For these settings, we design a provably sample-efficient algorithm which achieves a $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(s_0^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the sparse case and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O} ( r ^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the low-rank case, using only $L = \\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches. Here $s_0$ and $r$ are the sparsity and rank of the reward parameter in sparse and low-rank cases, respectively, and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(\\cdot)$ omits logarithmic factors involving the feature dimensions. In other words, our algorithm achieves regret bounds comparable to those in fully sequential setting with only $\\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches. Our algorithm features a novel batch allocation method that adjusts the batch sizes according to the estimation accuracy within each batch and cumulative regret. Furthermore, we also conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data to validate our theory",

    "abstract": "In response to legislation mandating companies to honor the \\textit{right to be forgotten} by erasing user data, it has become imperative to enable data removal in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) where multiple parties provide private features for model training.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel observer-based approach to detect and isolate faulty sensors in nonlinear systems. The proposed sensor fault detection and isolation (s-FDI) method applies to a general class of nonlinear systems. Our focus is on s-FDI for two types of faults: complete failure and sensor degradation. The key aspect of this approach lies in the utilization of a neural network-based Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observer. The neural network is trained to learn the dynamics of the observer, enabling accurate output predictions of the system. Sensor faults are detected by comparing the actual output measurements with the predicted values. If the difference surpasses a theoretical threshold, a sensor fault is detected. To identify and isolate which sensor is faulty, we compare the numerical difference of each sensor meassurement with an empirically derived threshold. We derive both theoretical and empirical thresholds for detection and isolation, respectively. Notably, the proposed approach is robust to measurement noise and system uncertainties. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through numerical simulations of sensor faults in a network of Kuramoto oscillators",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create \"expert\" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become a widely used tool for automating neural network design. While one-shot NAS methods have successfully reduced computational requirements, they often require extensive training. On the other hand, zero-shot NAS utilizes training-free proxies to evaluate a candidate architecture's test performance but has two limitations: (1) inability to use the information gained as a network improves with training and (2) unreliable performance, particularly in complex domains like RecSys, due to the multi-modal data inputs and complex architecture configurations. To synthesize the benefits of both methods, we introduce a \"sub-one-shot\" paradigm that serves as a bridge between zero-shot and one-shot NAS. In sub-one-shot NAS, the supernet is trained using only a small subset of the training data, a phase we refer to as \"warm-up.\" Within this framework, we present SiGeo, a proxy founded on a novel theoretical framework that connects the supernet warm-up with the efficacy of the proxy. Extensive experiments have shown that SiGeo, with the benefit of warm-up, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS proxies on various established NAS benchmarks. When a supernet is warmed up, it can achieve comparable performance to weight-sharing one-shot NAS methods, but with a significant reduction ($\\sim 60$\\%) in computational costs",

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems that evolve continuously over time are ubiquitous throughout science and engineering. Machine learning (ML) provides data-driven approaches to model and predict the dynamics of such systems. A core issue with this approach is that ML models are typically trained on discrete data, using ML methodologies that are not aware of underlying continuity properties. This results in models that often do not capture any underlying continuous dynamics -- either of the system of interest, or indeed of any related system. To address this challenge, we develop a convergence test based on numerical analysis theory. Our test verifies whether a model has learned a function that accurately approximates an underlying continuous dynamics. Models that fail this test fail to capture relevant dynamics, rendering them of limited utility for many scientific prediction tasks; while models that pass this test enable both better interpolation and better extrapolation in multiple ways. Our results illustrate how principled numerical analysis methods can be coupled with existing ML training/testing methodologies to validate models for science and engineering applications",

    "abstract": "This paper jointly considers privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning. In a decentralized network, honest-but-curious agents faithfully follow the prescribed algorithm, but expect to infer their neighbors' private data from messages received during the learning process, while dishonest-and-Byzantine agents disobey the prescribed algorithm, and deliberately disseminate wrong messages to their neighbors so as to bias the learning process. For this novel setting, we investigate a generic privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework, in which Gaussian noise is injected to preserve privacy and robust aggregation rules are adopted to counteract Byzantine attacks. We analyze its learning error and privacy guarantee, discovering an essential tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness in decentralized learning -- the learning error caused by defending against Byzantine attacks is exacerbated by the Gaussian noise added to preserve privacy. For a class of state-of-the-art robust aggregation rules, we give unified analysis of the \"mixing abilities\". Building upon this analysis, we reveal how the \"mixing abilities\" affect the tradeoff between privacy preservation and Byzantine-robustness. The theoretical results provide guidelines for achieving a favorable tradeoff with proper design of robust aggregation rules.

Specifically, given sample access to two unknown distributions $\\mathbf p, \\mathbf q$ on $\\mathbb R^d$, we want to distinguish between the case that $\\mathbf p=\\mathbf q$ versus $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k} > \\epsilon$, where $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k}$ denotes the generalized ${A}_k$ distance between $\\mathbf p$ and $\\mathbf q$ -- measuring the maximum discrepancy between the distributions over any collection of $k$ disjoint, axis-aligned rectangles.

In more detail, we provide a computationally efficient closeness tester with sample complexity $O\\left((k^{6/7}/ \\mathrm{poly}_d(\\epsilon)) \\log^d(k)\\right)$. On the lower bound side, we establish a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(k^{6/7}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$, even for $d=2$. These sample complexity bounds are surprising because the sample complexity of the problem in the univariate setting is $\\Theta(k^{4/5}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$. This has the interesting consequence that the jump from one to two dimensions leads to a substantial increase in sample complexity, while increases beyond that do not. As a corollary of our general $A_k$ tester, we obtain $d_{\\mathrm TV}$-closeness testers for pairs of $k$-histograms on $\\mathbb R^d$ over a common unknown partition, and pairs of uniform distributions supported on the union of $k$ unknown disjoint axis-aligned rectangles.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs), which extend Large Language Models (LLM) by incorporating visual understanding capability, have demonstrated significant advancements in addressing open-ended visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. However, these models cannot accurately interpret images infused with text, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. Standard procedures for extracting information from images often involve learning a fixed set of query embeddings. These embeddings are designed to encapsulate image contexts and are later used as soft prompt inputs in LLMs. Yet, this process is limited to the token count, potentially curtailing the recognition of scenes with text-rich context. To improve upon them, the present study introduces BLIVA: an augmented version of InstructBLIP with Visual Assistant. BLIVA incorporates the query embeddings from InstructBLIP and also directly projects encoded patch embeddings into the LLM, a technique inspired by LLaVA. This approach assists the model to capture intricate details potentially missed during the query decoding process. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our model, BLIVA, significantly enhances performance in processing text-rich VQA benchmarks (up to 17.76% in OCR-VQA benchmark) and in undertaking general (not particularly text-rich) VQA benchmarks (up to 7.9% in Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark), comparing to our baseline InstructBLIP. BLIVA demonstrates significant capability in decoding real-world images, irrespective of text presence. To demonstrate the broad industry applications enabled by BLIVA, we evaluate the model using a new dataset comprising YouTube thumbnails paired with question-answer sets across 11 diverse categories.

Our main idea is to reduce OT to a small optimization problem that has significantly fewer variables by utilizing cyclic symmetry and various optimization techniques. On the basis of this reduction, our algorithms solve the small optimization problem instead of the original OT. As a result, our algorithms obtain the optimal solution and the objective function value of the original OT faster than solving the original OT directly. In this paper, our focus is on two crucial OT formulations: the linear programming OT (LOT) and the strongly convex-regularized OT, which includes the well-known entropy-regularized OT (EROT). Experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithms for LOT and EROT in synthetic/real-world data that has a strict/approximate cyclic symmetry structure.

In this paper, we integrate CTC with a variational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more generalizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two versions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the first being that the variational latent variables at each time step are conditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are Markovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the variational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present computationally tractable forms for implementing them",

We finetune open-source MPT-7B and MPT-30B models on instruction finetuning datasets of various sizes ranging from 1k to 60k samples. We find that subsets of 1k-6k instruction finetuning samples are sufficient to achieve good performance on both (1) traditional NLP benchmarks and (2) model-based evaluation. Finally, we show that mixing textbook-style and open-ended QA finetuning datasets optimizes performance on both evaluation paradigms",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We propose a privacy-preserving uplink over-the-air computation (AirComp) method, termed FLORAS, for single-input single-output (SISO) wireless federated learning (FL) systems. From the perspective of communication designs, FLORAS eliminates the requirement of channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT) by leveraging the properties of orthogonal sequences. From the privacy perspective, we prove that FLORAS offers both item-level and client-level differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Moreover, by properly adjusting the system parameters, FLORAS can flexibly achieve different DP levels at no additional cost. A new FL convergence bound is derived which, combined with the privacy guarantees, allows for a smooth tradeoff between the achieved convergence rate and differential privacy levels. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FLORAS compared with the baseline AirComp method, and validate that the analytical results can guide the design of privacy-preserving FL with different tradeoff requirements on the model convergence and privacy levels",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We present ShaDDR, an example-based deep generative neural network which produces a high-resolution textured 3D shape through geometry detailization and conditional texture generation applied to an input coarse voxel shape. Trained on a small set of detailed and textured exemplar shapes, our method learns to detailize the geometry via multi-resolution voxel upsampling and generate textures on voxel surfaces via differentiable rendering against exemplar texture images from a few views. The generation is interactive, taking less than 1 second to produce a 3D model with voxel resolutions up to 512^3. The generated shape preserves the overall structure of the input coarse voxel model, while the style of the generated geometric details and textures can be manipulated through learned latent codes. In the experiments, we show that our method can generate higher-resolution shapes with plausible and improved geometric details and clean textures compared to prior works. Furthermore, we showcase the ability of our method to learn geometric details and textures from shapes reconstructed from real-world photos. In addition, we have developed an interactive modeling application to demonstrate the generalizability of our method to various user inputs and the controllability it offers, allowing users to interactively sculpt a coarse voxel shape to define the overall structure of the detailized 3D shape.

    "title": "Verified Compositional Neuro-Symbolic Control for Stochastic Systems with Temporal Logic Tasks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Several methods have been proposed recently to learn neural network (NN) controllers for autonomous agents, with unknown and stochastic dynamics, tasked with complex missions captured by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Due to the sample-inefficiency of the majority of these works, compositional learning methods have been proposed decomposing the LTL specification into smaller sub-tasks. Then, separate controllers are learned and composed to satisfy the original task. A key challenge within these approaches is that they often lack safety guarantees or the provided guarantees are impractical. This paper aims to address this challenge. Particularly, we consider autonomous systems with unknown and stochastic dynamics and LTL-encoded tasks. We assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of base skills modeled by trained NN feedback controllers. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that will yield a composite system behavior that satisfies the assigned LTL task with probability one. We propose a new approach that relies on a novel integration of automata theory and data-driven reachability analysis tools for NN-controlled stochastic systems. The resulting neuro-symbolic controller allows the agent to generate safe behaviors for unseen complex temporal logic tasks in a zero-shot fashion by leveraging its base skills. We show correctness of the proposed method and we provide conditions under which it is complete. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that designs verified temporal compositions of NN controllers for unknown and stochastic systems. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations and hardware experiments on robot navigation tasks to demonstrate the proposed method",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great promise with algorithms learning in environments with large state and action spaces purely from scalar reward signals. A crucial challenge for current deep RL algorithms is that they require a tremendous amount of environment interactions for learning. This can be infeasible in situations where such interactions are expensive; such as in robotics. Offline RL algorithms try to address this issue by bootstrapping the learning process from existing logged data without needing to interact with the environment from the very beginning. While online RL algorithms are typically evaluated as a function of the number of environment interactions, there exists no single established protocol for evaluating offline RL methods.In this paper, we propose a sequential approach to evaluate offline RL algorithms as a function of the training set size and thus by their data efficiency. Sequential evaluation provides valuable insights into the data efficiency of the learning process and the robustness of algorithms to distribution changes in the dataset while also harmonizing the visualization of the offline and online learning phases. Our approach is generally applicable and easy to implement. We compare several existing offline RL algorithms using this approach and present insights from a variety of tasks and offline datasets",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving distributed training scheme, where multiple devices collaborate to train machine learning models by uploading local model updates. To improve communication efficiency, over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been applied to FL, which leverages analog modulation to harness the superposition property of radio waves such that numerous devices can upload their model updates concurrently for aggregation. However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model aggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling and compromises the learned model performance. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic device scheduling framework for over-the-air FL, named PO-FL, to mitigate the negative impact of channel noise, where each device is scheduled according to a certain probability and its model update is reweighted using this probability in aggregation. We prove the unbiasedness of this aggregation scheme and demonstrate the convergence of PO-FL on both convex and non-convex loss functions. Our convergence bounds unveil that the device scheduling affects the learning performance through the communication distortion and global update variance. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop a channel and gradient-importance aware algorithm to optimize the device scheduling probabilities in PO-FL. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed PO-FL framework with channel and gradient-importance awareness achieves faster convergence and produces better models than baseline methods",

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

Unlike existing methods, we discretize nonlinear hyperelasticity in a meshless way, obviating the necessity for intermediate auxiliary shape proxies like a tetrahedral mesh or voxel grid. A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation. As a result, physically realistic animations can be conveniently synthesized using our method for a wide range of hyperelastic materials at an interactive rate.

    "title": "Stable Unlearnable Example: Enhancing the Robustness of Unlearnable Examples via Stable Error-Minimizing Noise",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Siegelmann and Sontag (1992) famously showed that RNNs with rational weights and hidden states and unbounded computation time are Turing complete. However, LMs define weightings over strings in addition to just (unweighted) language membership and the analysis of the computational power of RNN LMs (RLMs) should reflect this. We extend the Turing completeness result to the probabilistic case, showing how a rationally weighted RLM with unbounded computation time can simulate any deterministic probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) with rationally weighted transitions. Since, in practice, RLMs work in real-time, processing a symbol at every time step, we treat the above result as an upper bound on the expressivity of RLMs. We also provide a lower bound by showing that under the restriction to real-time computation, such models can simulate deterministic real-time rational PTMs",

The Predict-Then-Optimize framework uses machine learning models to predict unknown parameters of an optimization problem from features before solving. Recent works show that decision quality can be improved in this setting by solving and differentiating the optimization problem in the training loop, enabling end-to-end training with loss functions defined directly on the resulting decisions. However, this approach can be inefficient and requires handcrafted, problem-specific rules for backpropagation through the optimization step. This paper proposes an alternative method, in which optimal solutions are learned directly from the observable features by predictive models. The approach is generic, and based on an adaptation of the Learning-to-Optimize paradigm, from which a rich variety of existing techniques can be employed.

To evaluate our cell's effectiveness, we compare its performance against the widely-used GRU and LSTM cells and the recently proposed Mogrifier LSTM on several tasks including, polyphonic music modeling, language modeling, and sentiment analysis. Our experiments show that RRU outperforms the traditional gated units on most of these tasks. Also, it has better robustness to parameter selection, allowing immediate application in new tasks without much tuning.

Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU.

We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frameworks for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance.

The first stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores.

    "title": "BOIS: Bayesian Optimization of Interconnected Systems",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the global optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. One of the main advantages of BO is its use of Gaussian processes (GPs) to characterize model uncertainty which can be leveraged to guide the learning and search process. However, BO typically treats systems as black-boxes and this limits the ability to exploit structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections). Composite functions of the form $f(x, y(x))$, wherein GP modeling is shifted from the performance function $f$ to an intermediate function $y$, offer an avenue for exploiting structural knowledge. However, the use of composite functions in a BO framework is complicated by the need to generate a probability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y$ calculated by the GP (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression). Previous work has handled this issue using sampling techniques; these are easy to implement and flexible but are computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm which allows for the efficient use of composite functions in BO; this uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain closed-form expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that this simple approach (which we call BOIS) enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. Using a chemical process optimization case study, we benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and sampling approaches. Our results indicate that BOIS achieves performance gains and accurately captures the statistics of composite functions",

    "title": "A General Theoretical Paradigm to Understand Learning from Human Preferences",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The prevalent deployment of learning from human preferences through reinforcement learning (RLHF) relies on two important approximations: the first assumes that pairwise preferences can be substituted with pointwise rewards. The second assumes that a reward model trained on these pointwise rewards can generalize from collected data to out-of-distribution data sampled by the policy. Recently, Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) has been proposed as an approach that bypasses the second approximation and learn directly a policy from collected data without the reward modelling stage. However, this method still heavily relies on the first approximation. In this paper we try to gain a deeper theoretical understanding of these practical algorithms. In particular we derive a new general objective called $\\Psi$PO for learning from human preferences that is expressed in terms of pairwise preferences and therefore bypasses both approximations. This new general objective allows us to perform an in-depth analysis of the behavior of RLHF and DPO (as special cases of $\\Psi$PO) and to identify their potential pitfalls. We then consider another special case for $\\Psi$PO by setting $\\Psi$ simply to Identity, for which we can derive an efficient optimisation procedure, prove performance guarantees and demonstrate its empirical superiority to DPO on some illustrative examples",

    "abstract": "High-resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images are crucial for ophthalmology studies but are limited by their relatively narrow field of view (FoV). Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \\textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also made our evaluation tool for image mosaicking and the corresponding pipeline publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking}",

    "title": "GeoCLIP: Clip-Inspired Alignment between Locations and Images for Effective Worldwide Geo-localization",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Worldwide Geo-localization aims to pinpoint the precise location of images taken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense variation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based approaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible to construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead, existing approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells, transforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance is limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate localizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class center. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel CLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between the image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder models the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding through random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation that captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich high-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for geo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive experiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive performance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even in limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate geo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image encoder.

The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization",

    "abstract": "In this work, we contribute the first visual open-source empirical study on human behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to investigate how compliant a general population is to mask-wearing-related public-health policy. Object-detection-based convolutional neural networks, regression analysis and multilayer perceptrons are combined to analyse visual data of the Viennese public during 2020. We find that mask-wearing-related government regulations and public-transport announcements encouraged correct mask-wearing-behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, changes in announcement and regulation contents led to heterogeneous effects on people's behaviour. Comparing the predictive power of regression analysis and neural networks, we demonstrate that the latter produces more accurate predictions of population reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our use of regression modelling also allows us to unearth possible causal pathways underlying societal behaviour. Since our findings highlight the importance of appropriate communication contents, our results will facilitate more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to be developed in future. Adding to the literature, we demonstrate that regression modelling and neural networks are not mutually exclusive but instead complement each other",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The Frank-Wolfe method has become increasingly useful in statistical and machine learning applications, due to the structure-inducing properties of the iterates, and especially in settings where linear minimization over the feasible set is more computationally efficient than projection. In the setting of Empirical Risk Minimization -- one of the fundamental optimization problems in statistical and machine learning -- the computational effectiveness of Frank-Wolfe methods typically grows linearly in the number of data observations $n$. This is in stark contrast to the case for typical stochastic projection methods. In order to reduce this dependence on $n$, we look to second-order smoothness of typical smooth loss functions (least squares loss and logistic loss, for example) and we propose amending the Frank-Wolfe method with Taylor series-approximated gradients, including variants for both deterministic and stochastic settings. Compared with current state-of-the-art methods in the regime where the optimality tolerance $\\varepsilon$ is sufficiently small, our methods are able to simultaneously reduce the dependence on large $n$ while obtaining optimal convergence rates of Frank-Wolfe methods, in both the convex and non-convex settings. We also propose a novel adaptive step-size approach for which we have computational guarantees. Last of all, we present computational experiments which show that our methods exhibit very significant speed-ups over existing methods on real-world datasets for both convex and non-convex binary classification problems",

Emerging computing systems that are amenable to hardware-level probabilistic computing, such as those that leverage stochastic devices, may make probabilistic neural networks more feasible in the not-too-distant future. This paper describes the scANN technique -- \\textit{sampling (by coinflips) artificial neural networks} -- which enables neural networks to be sampled directly by treating the weights as Bernoulli coin flips.

    "title": "Favour: FAst Variance Operator for Uncertainty Rating",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have emerged as a crucial approach for interpreting ML predictions. By sampling from the posterior distribution, data scientists may estimate the uncertainty of an inference. Unfortunately many inference samples are often needed, the overhead of which greatly hinder BNN's wide adoption. To mitigate this, previous work proposed propagating the first and second moments of the posterior directly through the network. However, on its own this method is even slower than sampling, so the propagated variance needs to be approximated such as assuming independence between neural nodes. The resulting trade-off between quality and inference time did not match even plain Monte Carlo sampling. Our contribution is a more principled variance propagation framework based on \"spiked covariance matrices\", which smoothly interpolates between quality and inference time. This is made possible by a new fast algorithm for updating a diagonal-plus-low-rank matrix approximation under various operations. We tested our algorithm against sampling based MC Dropout and Variational Inference on a number of downstream uncertainty themed tasks, such as calibration and out-of-distribution testing. We find that Favour is as fast as performing 2-3 inference samples, while matching the performance of 10-100 samples. In summary, this work enables the use of BNN in the realm of performance critical tasks where they have previously been out of reach",

Using influence functions, we craft healthy noise that helps to harden the classification model against poisoning attacks without significantly affecting the generalization ability on test data. In addition, our method can perform effectively when only a subset of the training data is modified, instead of the current method of adding noise to all examples that has been used in several previous works. We conduct comprehensive evaluations over two image datasets with state-of-the-art poisoning attacks under different realistic attack scenarios.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We introduce Epsilon*, a new privacy metric for measuring the privacy risk of a single model instance prior to, during, or after deployment of privacy mitigation strategies. The metric requires only black-box access to model predictions, does not require training data re-sampling or model re-training, and can be used to measure the privacy risk of models not trained with differential privacy. Epsilon* is a function of true positive and false positive rates in a hypothesis test used by an adversary in a membership inference attack. We distinguish between quantifying the privacy loss of a trained model instance, which we refer to as empirical privacy, and quantifying the privacy loss of the training mechanism which produces this model instance. Existing approaches in the privacy auditing literature provide lower bounds for the latter, while our metric provides an empirical lower bound for the former by relying on an (${\\epsilon}$, ${\\delta}$)-type of quantification of the privacy of the trained model instance. We establish a relationship between these lower bounds and show how to implement Epsilon* to avoid numerical and noise amplification instability. We further show in experiments on benchmark public data sets that Epsilon* is sensitive to privacy risk mitigation by training with differential privacy (DP), where the value of Epsilon* is reduced by up to 800% compared to the Epsilon* values of non-DP trained baseline models. This metric allows privacy auditors to be independent of model owners, and enables visualizing the privacy-utility landscape to make informed decisions regarding the trade-offs between model privacy and utility",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Treatment pathways are step-by-step plans outlining the recommended medical care for specific diseases; they get revised when different treatments are found to improve patient outcomes. Examining health records is an important part of this revision process, but inferring patients' actual treatments from health data is challenging due to complex event-coding schemes and the absence of pathway-related annotations. This study aims to infer the actual treatment steps for a particular patient group from administrative health records (AHR) - a common form of tabular healthcare data - and address several technique- and methodology-based gaps in treatment pathway-inference research. We introduce Defrag, a method for examining AHRs to infer the real-world treatment steps for a particular patient group. Defrag learns the semantic and temporal meaning of healthcare event sequences, allowing it to reliably infer treatment steps from complex healthcare data. To our knowledge, Defrag is the first pathway-inference method to utilise a neural network (NN), an approach made possible by a novel, self-supervised learning objective. We also developed a testing and validation framework for pathway inference, which we use to characterise and evaluate Defrag's pathway inference ability and compare against baselines. We demonstrate Defrag's effectiveness by identifying best-practice pathway fragments for breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma in public healthcare records. Additionally, we use synthetic data experiments to demonstrate the characteristics of the Defrag method, and to compare Defrag to several baselines where it significantly outperforms non-NN-based methods. Defrag significantly outperforms several existing pathway-inference methods and offers an innovative and effective approach for inferring treatment pathways from AHRs.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Many machine learning tasks can be formulated as a stochastic compositional optimization (SCO) problem such as reinforcement learning, AUC maximization, and meta-learning, where the objective function involves a nested composition associated with an expectation. While a significant amount of studies has been devoted to studying the convergence behavior of SCO algorithms, there is little work on understanding their generalization, i.e., how these learning algorithms built from training examples would behave on future test examples. In this paper, we provide the stability and generalization analysis of stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms through the lens of algorithmic stability in the framework of statistical learning theory. Firstly, we introduce a stability concept called compositional uniform stability and establish its quantitative relation with generalization for SCO problems. Then, we establish the compositional uniform stability results for two popular stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms, namely SCGD and SCSC. Finally, we derive dimension-independent excess risk bounds for SCGD and SCSC by trade-offing their stability results and optimization errors. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first-ever-known results on stability and generalization analysis of stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces GeoMorph, a novel geometric deep-learning framework designed for image registration of cortical surfaces. The registration process consists of two main steps. First, independent feature extraction is performed on each input surface using graph convolutions, generating low-dimensional feature representations that capture important cortical surface characteristics. Subsequently, features are registered in a deep-discrete manner to optimize the overlap of common structures across surfaces by learning displacements of a set of control points. To ensure smooth and biologically plausible deformations, we implement regularization through a deep conditional random field implemented with a recurrent neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoMorph surpasses existing deep-learning methods by achieving improved alignment with smoother deformations. Furthermore, GeoMorph exhibits competitive performance compared to classical frameworks. Such versatility and robustness suggest strong potential for various neuroscience applications",

    "title": "Fast and Interpretable Mortality Risk Scores for Critical Care Patients",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is an important task in critical care medicine. Prior work in creating mortality risk models falls into two major categories: domain-expert-created scoring systems, and black box machine learning (ML) models. Both of these have disadvantages: black box models are unacceptable for use in hospitals, whereas manual creation of models (including hand-tuning of logistic regression parameters) relies on humans to perform high-dimensional constrained optimization, which leads to a loss in performance. In this work, we bridge the gap between accurate black box models and hand-tuned interpretable models. We build on modern interpretable ML techniques to design accurate and interpretable mortality risk scores. We leverage the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets, namely the MIMIC III and eICU datasets. By evaluating risk across medical centers, we are able to study generalization across domains. In order to customize our risk score models, we develop a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several important benefits: (1) it uses hard sparsity constraint, allowing users to directly control the number of features; (2) it incorporates group sparsity to allow more cohesive models; (3) it allows for monotonicity correction on models for including domain knowledge; (4) it produces many equally-good models at once, which allows domain experts to choose among them. GroupFasterRisk creates its risk scores within hours, even on the large datasets we study here. GroupFasterRisk's risk scores perform better than risk scores currently used in hospitals, and have similar prediction performance to black box ML models (despite being much sparser). Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of risk scores and handles constraints, it allows design flexibility, which is the key enabler of practical and trustworthy model creation",

    "abstract": "In the domain of autonomous driving, the Learning from Demonstration (LfD) paradigm has exhibited notable efficacy in addressing sequential decision-making problems. However, consistently achieving safety in varying traffic contexts, especially in safety-critical scenarios, poses a significant challenge due to the long-tailed and unforeseen scenarios absent from offline datasets. In this paper, we introduce the saFety-aware strUctured Scenario representatION (FUSION), a pioneering methodology conceived to facilitate the learning of an adaptive end-to-end driving policy by leveraging structured scenario information. FUSION capitalizes on the causal relationships between decomposed reward, cost, state, and action space, constructing a framework for structured sequential reasoning under dynamic traffic environments. We conduct rigorous evaluations in two typical real-world settings of distribution shift in autonomous vehicles, demonstrating the good balance between safety cost and utility reward of FUSION compared to contemporary state-of-the-art safety-aware LfD baselines. Empirical evidence under diverse driving scenarios attests that FUSION significantly enhances the safety and generalizability of autonomous driving agents, even in the face of challenging and unseen environments. Furthermore, our ablation studies reveal noticeable improvements in the integration of causal representation into the safe offline RL problem",

    "abstract": "The Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) family of methods is foundational in multi-view learning. Regularised linear CCA methods can be seen to generalise Partial Least Squares (PLS) and be unified with a Generalized Eigenvalue Problem (GEP) framework. However, classical algorithms for these linear methods are computationally infeasible for large-scale data. Extensions to Deep CCA show great promise, but current training procedures are slow and complicated. First we propose a novel unconstrained objective that characterizes the top subspace of GEPs. Our core contribution is a family of fast algorithms for stochastic PLS, stochastic CCA, and Deep CCA, simply obtained by applying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to the corresponding CCA objectives. These methods show far faster convergence and recover higher correlations than the previous state-of-the-art on all standard CCA and Deep CCA benchmarks. This speed allows us to perform a first-of-its-kind PLS analysis of an extremely large biomedical dataset from the UK Biobank, with over 33,000 individuals and 500,000 variants. Finally, we not only match the performance of `CCA-family' Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with minimal hyper-parameter tuning, but also establish the first solid theoretical links to classical CCA, laying the groundwork for future insights",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The rapid progress of AI, combined with its unprecedented public adoption and the propensity of large neural networks to memorize training data, has given rise to significant data privacy concerns. To address these concerns, machine unlearning has emerged as an essential technique to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points on trained models. In this paper, we approach the machine unlearning problem through the lens of continual learning. Given a trained model and a subset of training data designated to be forgotten (i.e., the \"forget set\"), we introduce a three-step process, named CovarNav, to facilitate this forgetting. Firstly, we derive a proxy for the model's training data using a model inversion attack. Secondly, we mislabel the forget set by selecting the most probable class that deviates from the actual ground truth. Lastly, we deploy a gradient projection method to minimize the cross-entropy loss on the modified forget set (i.e., learn incorrect labels for this set) while preventing forgetting of the inverted samples. We rigorously evaluate CovarNav on the CIFAR-10 and Vggface2 datasets, comparing our results with recent benchmarks in the field and demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach",

Given the inherent compositional nature of language, one can expect the model to learn to compose these capabilities, potentially yielding a combinatorial explosion of what operations it can perform on an input. Motivated by the above, we aim to assess in this paper \"how capable can a transformer become?\". Specifically, we train autoregressive Transformer models on a data-generating process that involves compositions of a set of well-defined monolithic capabilities. Through a series of extensive and systematic experiments on this data-generating process, we show that: (1) autoregressive Transformers can learn compositional structures from the training data and generalize to exponentially or even combinatorially many functions; (2) composing functions by generating intermediate outputs is more effective at generalizing to unseen compositions, compared to generating no intermediate outputs; (3) the training data has a significant impact on the model's ability to compose unseen combinations of functions; and (4) the attention layers in the latter half of the model are critical to compositionality",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive measurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the cardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a general family of algorithms that covers a wide range of novel and fundamental methods in reinforcement learning. Motivated by the instability of policy iteration (PI) with inexact policy evaluation, PMD algorithmically regularises the policy improvement step of PI. With exact policy evaluation, PI is known to converge linearly with a rate given by the discount factor $\\gamma$ of a Markov Decision Process. In this work, we bridge the gap between PI and PMD with exact policy evaluation and show that the dimension-free $\\gamma$-rate of PI can be achieved by the general family of unregularised PMD algorithms under an adaptive step-size. We show that both the rate and step-size are unimprovable for PMD: we provide matching lower bounds that demonstrate that the $\\gamma$-rate is optimal for PMD methods as well as PI, and that the adaptive step-size is necessary for PMD to achieve it. Our work is the first to relate PMD to rate-optimality and step-size necessity. Our study of the convergence of PMD avoids the use of the performance difference lemma, which leads to a direct analysis of independent interest. We also extend the analysis to the inexact setting and establish the first dimension-optimal sample complexity for unregularised PMD under a generative model, improving upon the best-known result",

This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff. The proposed model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of approximately 45.7%, which is a significant improvement, outperforming the RCNN model by 4.7% on the same dataset. This advancement underscores the effectiveness of the proposed modifications and sets a new benchmark in aerial image analysis, paving the way for more accurate and efficient object detection methodologies.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "While the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices is increasing, these models often lack robustness when faced with dynamic changes in sensed data. This can be attributed to sensor drift, or variations in the data compared to what was used during offline training due to factors such as specific sensor placement or naturally changing sensing conditions. Hence, achieving the desired robustness necessitates the utilization of either an invariant architecture or specialized training approaches, like data augmentation. Alternatively, input transformations can be treated as a domain shift problem, and solved by post-deployment model adaptation. In this paper, we train a parameterized subspace of configurable networks, where an optimal network for a particular parameter setting is part of this subspace. The obtained subspace is low-dimensional and has a surprisingly simple structure even for complex, non-invertible transformations of the input, leading to an exceptionally high efficiency of subspace-configurable networks (SCNs) when limited storage and computing resources are at stake. We evaluate SCNs on a wide range of standard datasets, architectures, and transformations, and demonstrate their power on resource-constrained IoT devices, where they can take up to 2.4 times less RAM and be 7.6 times faster at inference time than a model that achieves the same test set accuracy, yet is trained with data augmentations to cover the desired range of input transformations",

One solution for state construction is to use recurrent neural networks. Back-propagation through time (BPTT), and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) are two popular gradient-based methods for recurrent learning. BPTT requires complete trajectories of observations before it can compute the gradients and is unsuitable for online updates. RTRL can do online updates but scales poorly to large networks. In this paper, we propose two constraints that make RTRL scalable. We show that by either decomposing the network into independent modules or learning the network in stages, we can make RTRL scale linearly with the number of parameters. Unlike prior scalable gradient estimation algorithms, such as UORO and Truncated-BPTT, our algorithms do not add noise or bias to the gradient estimate. Instead, they trade off the functional capacity of the network for computationally efficient learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over Truncated-BPTT on a prediction benchmark inspired by animal learning and by doing policy evaluation of pre-trained policies for Atari 2600 games",

    "abstract": "We observe a large variety of robots in terms of their bodies, sensors, and actuators. Given the commonalities in the skill sets, teaching each skill to each different robot independently is inefficient and not scalable when the large variety in the robotic landscape is considered. If we can learn the correspondences between the sensorimotor spaces of different robots, we can expect a skill that is learned in one robot can be more directly and easily transferred to other robots. In this paper, we propose a method to learn correspondences among two or more robots that may have different morphologies. To be specific, besides robots with similar morphologies with different degrees of freedom, we show that a fixed-based manipulator robot with joint control and a differential drive mobile robot can be addressed within the proposed framework. To set up the correspondence among the robots considered, an initial base task is demonstrated to the robots to achieve the same goal. Then, a common latent representation is learned along with the individual robot policies for achieving the goal. After the initial learning stage, the observation of a new task execution by one robot becomes sufficient to generate a latent space representation pertaining to the other robots to achieve the same task. We verified our system in a set of experiments where the correspondence between robots is learned (1) when the robots need to follow the same paths to achieve the same task, (2) when the robots need to follow different trajectories to achieve the same task, and (3) when complexities of the required sensorimotor trajectories are different for the robots.

However, due to differences in the subgrid physics implementation and numerical approximations across different simulation suites, models trained on data from one cosmological simulation show a drop in performance when tested on another. Similarly, models trained on any of the simulations would also likely experience a drop in performance when applied to observational data. Training on data from two different suites of the CAMELS hydrodynamic cosmological simulations, we examine the generalization capabilities of Domain Adaptive Graph Neural Networks (DA-GNNs). By utilizing GNNs, we capitalize on their capacity to capture structured scale-free cosmological information from galaxy distributions. Moreover, by including unsupervised domain adaptation via Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), we enable our models to extract domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that DA-GNN achieves higher accuracy and robustness on cross-dataset tasks (up to $28\\%$ better relative error and up to almost an order of magnitude better $\\chi^2$). Using data visualizations, we show the effects of domain adaptation on proper latent space data alignment.

    "abstract": "In collaborative human-robot manipulation, a robot must predict human intents and adapt its actions accordingly to smoothly execute tasks. However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead train marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional model improves over various marginal baselines.

What are the crucial factors that led to an automated prediction/decision? 2. How can these factors be changed to achieve a more favorable outcome from a user's perspective? Thus, guiding the user's interaction with AI systems by proposing easy-to-understand explanations and easy-to-attain feasible changes is essential for the trustworthy adoption and long-term acceptance of AI systems. In the literature, various methods have been proposed to generate CEs, and different quality measures have been suggested to evaluate these methods. However, the generation of CEs is usually computationally expensive, and the resulting suggestions are unrealistic and thus non-actionable. In this paper, we introduce a new method to generate CEs for a pre-trained binary classifier by first shaping the latent space of an autoencoder to be a mixture of Gaussian distributions. CEs are then generated in latent space by linear interpolation between the query sample and the centroid of the target class. We show that our method maintains the characteristics of the input sample during the counterfactual search. In various experiments, we show that the proposed method is competitive based on different quality measures on image and tabular datasets -- efficiently returns results that are closer to the original data manifold compared to three state-of-the-art methods, which are essential for realistic high-dimensional machine learning applications",

    "title": "Hierarchical Learning for Quantum ML: Novel Training Technique for Large-Scale Variational Quantum Circuits",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We present hierarchical learning, a novel variational architecture for efficient training of large-scale variational quantum circuits. We test and benchmark our technique for distribution loading with quantum circuit born machines (QCBMs). With QCBMs, probability distributions are loaded into the squared amplitudes of computational basis vectors represented by bitstrings. Our key insight is to take advantage of the fact that the most significant (qu)bits have a greater effect on the final distribution and can be learned first. One can think of it as a generalization of layerwise learning, where some parameters of the variational circuit are learned first to prevent the phenomena of barren plateaus. We briefly review adjoint methods for computing the gradient, in particular for loss functions that are not expectation values of observables. We first compare the role of connectivity in the variational ansatz for the task of loading a Gaussian distribution on nine qubits, finding that 2D connectivity greatly outperforms qubits arranged on a line. Based on our observations, we then implement this strategy on large-scale numerical experiments with GPUs, training a QCBM to reproduce a 3-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution on 27 qubits up to $\\sim4\\%$ total variation distance. Though barren plateau arguments do not strictly apply here due to the objective function not being tied to an observable, this is to our knowledge the first practical demonstration of variational learning on large numbers of qubits. We also demonstrate hierarchical learning as a resource-efficient way to load distributions for existing quantum hardware (IBM's 7 and 27 qubit devices) in tandem with Fire Opal optimizations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and increasingly difficult the less information is available. Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

    "abstract": "Networks are ubiquitous in many real-world applications (e.g., social networks encoding trust/distrust relationships, correlation networks arising from time series data). While many networks are signed or directed, or both, there is a lack of unified software packages on graph neural networks (GNNs) specially designed for signed and directed networks. In this paper, we present PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed (PyGSD), a software package which fills this gap. Along the way, we evaluate the implemented methods with experiments with a view to providing insights into which method to choose for a given task. The deep learning framework consists of easy-to-use GNN models, synthetic and real-world data, as well as task-specific evaluation metrics and loss functions for signed and directed networks. As an extension library for PyG, our proposed software is maintained with open-source releases, detailed documentation, continuous integration, unit tests and code coverage checks.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden capabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task. We additionally perform analysis on language models trained on the TinyStories dataset to support our claims in a more realistic setup",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, arbitrary interactions with the environment can often be costly, and actions of expert demonstrations are not always available. To reduce the need for both, Offline Learning from Observations (LfO) is extensively studied, where the agent learns to solve a task with only expert states and \\textit{task-agnostic} non-expert state-action pairs. The state-of-the-art DIstribution Correction Estimation (DICE) methods minimize the state occupancy divergence between the learner and expert policies. However, they are limited to either $f$-divergences (KL and $\\chi^2$) or Wasserstein distance with Rubinstein duality, the latter of which constrains the underlying distance metric crucial to the performance of Wasserstein-based solutions. To address this problem, we propose Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE), which minimizes the primal Wasserstein distance between the expert and learner state occupancies with a pessimistic regularizer and leverages a contrastively learned distance as the underlying metric for the Wasserstein distance. Theoretically, we prove that our framework is a generalization of the state-of-the-art, SMODICE, and unifies $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization. Empirically, we find that PW-DICE improves upon several state-of-the-art methods on multiple testbeds",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "There is growing interest in improving our algorithmic understanding of fundamental statistical problems such as mean estimation, driven by the goal of understanding the limits of what we can extract from valuable data. The state of the art results for mean estimation in $\\mathbb{R}$ are 1) the optimal sub-Gaussian mean estimator by [LV22], with the tight sub-Gaussian constant for all distributions with finite but unknown variance, and 2) the analysis of the median-of-means algorithm by [BCL13] and a lower bound by [DLLO16], characterizing the big-O optimal errors for distributions for which only a $1+\\alpha$ moment exists for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. Both results, however, are optimal only in the worst case. We initiate the fine-grained study of the mean estimation problem: Can algorithms leverage useful features of the input distribution to beat the sub-Gaussian rate, without explicit knowledge of such features? We resolve this question with an unexpectedly nuanced answer: \"Yes in limited regimes, but in general no\". For any distribution $p$ with a finite mean, we construct a distribution $q$ whose mean is well-separated from $p$'s, yet $p$ and $q$ are not distinguishable with high probability, and $q$ further preserves $p$'s moments up to constants. The main consequence is that no reasonable estimator can asymptotically achieve better than the sub-Gaussian error rate for any distribution, matching the worst-case result of [LV22]. More generally, we introduce a new definitional framework to analyze the fine-grained optimality of algorithms, which we call \"neighborhood optimality\", interpolating between the unattainably strong \"instance optimality\" and the trivially weak \"admissibility\" definitions. Applying the new framework, we show that median-of-means is neighborhood optimal, up to constant factors. It is open to find a neighborhood-optimal estimator without constant factor slackness",

    "abstract": "Automatic assessment of impairment and disease severity is a key challenge in data-driven medicine. We propose a novel framework to address this challenge, which leverages AI models trained exclusively on healthy individuals. The COnfidence-Based chaRacterization of Anomalies (COBRA) score exploits the decrease in confidence of these models when presented with impaired or diseased patients to quantify their deviation from the healthy population. We applied the COBRA score to address a key limitation of current clinical evaluation of upper-body impairment in stroke patients. The gold-standard Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) requires in-person administration by a trained assessor for 30-45 minutes, which restricts monitoring frequency and precludes physicians from adapting rehabilitation protocols to the progress of each patient. The COBRA score, computed automatically in under one minute, is shown to be strongly correlated with the FMA on an independent test cohort for two different data modalities: wearable sensors ($\\rho = 0.845$, 95% CI [0.743,0.908]) and video ($\\rho = 0.746$, 95% C.I [0.594, 0.847]). To demonstrate the generalizability of the approach to other conditions, the COBRA score was also applied to quantify severity of knee osteoarthritis from magnetic-resonance imaging scans, again achieving significant correlation with an independent clinical assessment ($\\rho = 0.644$, 95% C.I [0.585,0.696])",

    "abstract": "Task arithmetic has recently emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach to edit pre-trained models directly in weight space: By adding the fine-tuned weights of different tasks, the model's performance can be improved on these tasks, while negating them leads to task forgetting. Yet, our understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying principles remains limited. We present a comprehensive study of task arithmetic in vision-language models and show that weight disentanglement is the crucial factor that makes it effective. This property arises during pre-training and manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized regions in function space associated with the tasks. Notably, we show that fine-tuning models in their tangent space by linearizing them amplifies weight disentanglement. This leads to substantial performance improvements across multiple task arithmetic benchmarks and diverse models. Building on these findings, we provide theoretical and empirical analyses of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of these models and establish a compelling link between task arithmetic and the spatial localization of the NTK eigenfunctions. Overall, our work uncovers novel insights into the fundamental mechanisms of task arithmetic and offers a more reliable and effective approach to edit pre-trained models through the NTK linearization",

However, standard numerical techniques for solving these PDEs are typically affected by the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we tackle this challenge while focusing on stationary diffusion equations defined over a high-dimensional domain with periodic boundary conditions. Inspired by recent progress in sparse function approximation in high dimensions, we propose a new method called compressive Fourier collocation. Combining ideas from compressive sensing and spectral collocation, our method replaces the use of structured collocation grids with Monte Carlo sampling and employs sparse recovery techniques, such as orthogonal matching pursuit and $\\ell^1$ minimization, to approximate the Fourier coefficients of the PDE solution. We conduct a rigorous theoretical analysis showing that the approximation error of the proposed method is comparable with the best $s$-term approximation (with respect to the Fourier basis) to the solution. Using the recently introduced framework of random sampling in bounded Riesz systems, our analysis shows that the compressive Fourier collocation method mitigates the curse of dimensionality with respect to the number of collocation points under sufficient conditions on the regularity of the diffusion coefficient. We also present numerical experiments that illustrate the accuracy and stability of the method for the approximation of sparse and compressible solutions",

    "title": "Deep Learning-Based Real-Time Quality Control of Standard Video Compression for Live Streaming",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Ensuring high-quality video content for wireless users has become increasingly vital. Nevertheless, maintaining a consistent level of video quality faces challenges due to the fluctuating encoded bitrate, primarily caused by dynamic video content, especially in live streaming scenarios. Video compression is typically employed to eliminate unnecessary redundancies within and between video frames, thereby reducing the required bandwidth for video transmission. The encoded bitrate and the quality of the compressed video depend on encoder parameters, specifically, the quantization parameter (QP). Poor choices of encoder parameters can result in reduced bandwidth efficiency and high likelihood of non-conformance. Non-conformance refers to the violation of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) constraint for an encoded video segment. To address these issues, a real-time deep learning-based H.264 controller is proposed. This controller dynamically estimates the optimal encoder parameters based on the content of a video chunk with minimal delay. The objective is to maintain video quality in terms of PSNR above a specified threshold while minimizing the average bitrate of the compressed video. Experimental results, conducted on both QCIF dataset and a diverse range of random videos from public datasets, validate the effectiveness of this approach. Notably, it achieves improvements of up to 2.5 times in average bandwidth usage compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive bitrate video streaming, with a negligible non-conformance probability below $10^{-2}$",

Orchard constructs cancer phylogenies progressively, one point mutation at a time, ultimately sampling complete phylogenies from a posterior distribution implied by the bulk DNA data. Orchard reconstructs more plausible phylogenies than state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods on 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs).

    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

This paper pioneers the investigation into the potential pitfalls associated with knowledge editing for LLMs. To achieve this, we introduce new benchmark datasets and propose innovative evaluation metrics. Our results underline two pivotal concerns: (1) Knowledge Conflict: Editing groups of facts that logically clash can magnify the inherent inconsistencies in LLMs-a facet neglected by previous methods. (2) Knowledge Distortion: Altering parameters with the aim of editing factual knowledge can irrevocably warp the innate knowledge structure of LLMs. Experimental results vividly demonstrate that knowledge editing might inadvertently cast a shadow of unintended consequences on LLMs, which warrant attention and efforts for future works.

    "abstract": "We present the neural-integrated meshfree (NIM) method, a differentiable programming-based hybrid meshfree approach within the field of computational mechanics. NIM seamlessly integrates traditional physics-based meshfree discretization techniques with deep learning architectures. It employs a hybrid approximation scheme, NeuroPU, to effectively represent the solution by combining continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis functions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This neural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation through functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN model and the need for spatial gradient computations based on automatic differentiation, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency. Under the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong form-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the S-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the loss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov-Galerkin approach that allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary overlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying physics and the preservation of meshfree property. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover, comparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods demonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel data-driven model capable of providing accurate predictions for the power generation of all wind turbines in wind farms of arbitrary layout, yaw angle configurations and wind conditions. The proposed model functions by encoding a wind farm into a fully-connected graph and processing the graph representation through a graph transformer. The graph transformer surrogate is shown to generalise well and is able to uncover latent structural patterns within the graph representation of wind farms. It is demonstrated how the resulting surrogate model can be used to optimise yaw angle configurations using genetic algorithms, achieving similar levels of accuracy to industrially-standard wind farm simulation tools while only taking a fraction of the computational cost",

    "abstract": "Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are considered as a valuable prognostic markers in both triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer. In this study, we introduce an innovative deep learning pipeline based on the Efficient-UNet architecture to predict the TILs score for breast cancer whole-slide images (WSIs). We first segment tumour and stromal regions in order to compute a tumour bulk mask. We then detect TILs within the tumour-associated stroma, generating a TILs score by closely mirroring the pathologist's workflow. Our method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in segmenting tumour/stroma areas and TILs detection, as demonstrated by internal cross-validation on the TiGER Challenge training dataset and evaluation on the final leaderboards. Additionally, our TILs score proves competitive in predicting survival outcomes within the same challenge, underscoring the clinical relevance and potential of our automated TILs scoring pipeline as a breast cancer prognostic tool",

    "abstract": "In this research, we address critical concerns related to the numerical instability observed in 16-bit computations of machine learning models. Such instability, particularly when employing popular optimization algorithms like Adam, often leads to unstable training of deep neural networks. This not only disrupts the learning process but also poses significant challenges in deploying dependable models in real-world applications. Our investigation identifies the epsilon hyperparameter as the primary source of this instability. A nuanced exploration reveals that subtle adjustments to epsilon within 16-bit computations can enhance the numerical stability of Adam, enabling more stable training of 16-bit neural networks. We propose a novel, dependable approach that leverages updates from the Adam optimizer to bolster the stability of the learning process. Our contributions provide deeper insights into optimization challenges in low-precision computations and offer solutions to ensure the stability of deep neural network training, paving the way for their dependable use in various applications",

As IoT time-series data is high-dimensional and high-frequency, time-series classification or regression has been a challenging issue in IoT. Recently, deep learning algorithms have demonstrated superior performance results in time-series data classification in many smart and intelligent IoT applications. However, it is hard to explore the hidden dynamic patterns and trends in time-series. Recent studies show that transforming IoT data into images improves the performance of the learning model. In this paper, we present a review of these studies which use image transformation/encoding techniques in IoT domain. We examine the studies according to their encoding techniques, data types, and application areas. Lastly, we emphasize the challenges and future dimensions of image transformation",

    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular tool for solving various problems over graphs. In these models, the link structure of the graph is typically exploited and nodes' embeddings are iteratively updated based on adjacent nodes. Nodes' contents are used solely in the form of feature vectors, served as nodes' first-layer embeddings. However, the filters or convolutions, applied during iterations/layers to these initial embeddings lead to their impact diminish and contribute insignificantly to the final embeddings. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose augmenting nodes' embeddings by embeddings generating from their content, at higher GNN layers. More precisely, we propose models wherein a structural embedding using a GNN and a content embedding are computed for each node. These two are combined using a combination layer to form the embedding of a node at a given layer. We suggest methods such as using an auto-encoder or building a content graph, to generate content embeddings. In the end, by conducting experiments over several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and performance of our models",

Yet, a largely unexplored facet of this paradigm is its susceptibility to adversarial attacks, especially with the aim of inducing forgetting. In this paper, we introduce \"BrainWash,\" a novel data poisoning method tailored to impose forgetting on a continual learner. By adding the BrainWash noise to a variety of baselines, we demonstrate how a trained continual learner can be induced to forget its previously learned tasks catastrophically, even when using these continual learning baselines. An important feature of our approach is that the attacker requires no access to previous tasks' data and is armed merely with the model's current parameters and the data belonging to the most recent task. Our extensive experiments highlight the efficacy of BrainWash, showcasing degradation in performance across various regularization-based continual learning methods",

    "abstract": "The goal of multi-objective optimization is to identify a collection of points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimization problem, practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarization functions in order to transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective problems. This set of scalarized problems can then be solved using traditional single-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we formalise this convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective optimization problem defined over sets. An appropriate class of objective functions for this new problem is the R2 utility function, which is defined as a weighted integral over the scalarized optimization problems. We show that this utility function is a monotone and submodular set function, which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimization algorithms. We analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimization, which is a popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimization",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Portfolio management (PM) is a fundamental financial trading task, which explores the optimal periodical reallocation of capitals into different stocks to pursue long-term profits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently shown its potential to train profitable agents for PM through interacting with financial markets. However, existing work mostly focuses on fixed stock pools, which is inconsistent with investors' practical demand. Specifically, the target stock pool of different investors varies dramatically due to their discrepancy on market states and individual investors may temporally adjust stocks they desire to trade (e.g., adding one popular stocks), which lead to customizable stock pools (CSPs). Existing RL methods require to retrain RL agents even with a tiny change of the stock pool, which leads to high computational cost and unstable performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose EarnMore, a rEinforcement leARNing framework with Maskable stOck REpresentation to handle PM with CSPs through one-shot training in a global stock pool (GSP). Specifically, we first introduce a mechanism to mask out the representation of the stocks outside the target pool. Second, we learn meaningful stock representations through a self-supervised masking and reconstruction process. Third, a re-weighting mechanism is designed to make the portfolio concentrate on favorable stocks and neglect the stocks outside the target pool. Through extensive experiments on 8 subset stock pools of the US stock market, we demonstrate that EarnMore significantly outperforms 14 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 popular financial metrics with over 40% improvement on profit",

Small changes to model hyperparameters and initializations can induce the discovery of qualitatively different algorithms from a fixed training set, and even parallel implementations of multiple such algorithms. Some networks trained to perform modular addition implement a familiar Clock algorithm; others implement a previously undescribed, less intuitive, but comprehensible procedure which we term the Pizza algorithm, or a variety of even more complex procedures. Our results show that even simple learning problems can admit a surprising diversity of solutions, motivating the development of new tools for characterizing the behavior of neural networks across their algorithmic phase space",

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) systems are often built and tested in a modular fashion, where the performance of different modules is measured using task-specific metrics. These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole. For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their implications for AD system deployment and testing",

Such autocurricula have received much interest from the RL community. However, UED experiments, based on CPU rollouts and GPU model updates, have often required several weeks of training. This compute requirement is a major obstacle to rapid innovation for the field. This work introduces the minimax library for UED training on accelerated hardware. Using JAX to implement fully-tensorized environments and autocurriculum algorithms, minimax allows the entire training loop to be compiled for hardware acceleration. To provide a petri dish for rapid experimentation, minimax includes a tensorized grid-world based on MiniGrid, in addition to reusable abstractions for conducting autocurricula in procedurally-generated environments. With these components, minimax provides strong UED baselines, including new parallelized variants, which achieve over 120$\\times$ speedups in wall time compared to previous implementations when training with equal batch sizes.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is an important emerging distributed training paradigm that keeps data private on clients. It is now well understood that by controlling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce a backdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes. In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness of the trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performance distribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where, for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could have disastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar to that of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregated model to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set of attributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controlling only a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL has previously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has been neglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be a critical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained model could benefit a user who participated in its training",

However, vanilla Transformer architectures have not yielded promising improvements in the Knowledge Graph (KG) representations, where the translational distance paradigm dominates this area. Note that vanilla Transformer architectures struggle to capture the intrinsically heterogeneous structural and semantic information of knowledge graphs. To this end, we propose a new variant of Transformer for knowledge graph representations dubbed Relphormer. Specifically, we introduce Triple2Seq which can dynamically sample contextualized sub-graph sequences as the input to alleviate the heterogeneity issue. We propose a novel structure-enhanced self-attention mechanism to encode the relational information and keep the semantic information within entities and relations. Moreover, we utilize masked knowledge modeling for general knowledge graph representation learning, which can be applied to various KG-based tasks including knowledge graph completion, question answering, and recommendation.

    "title": "Differentially Private Optimizers Can Learn Adversarially Robust Models",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models have shone in a variety of domains and attracted increasing attention from both the security and the privacy communities. One important yet worrying question is: Will training models under the differential privacy (DP) constraint have an unfavorable impact on their adversarial robustness? While previous works have postulated that privacy comes at the cost of worse robustness, we give the first theoretical analysis to show that DP models can indeed be robust and accurate, even sometimes more robust than their naturally-trained non-private counterparts. We observe three key factors that influence the privacy-robustness-accuracy tradeoff: (1) hyper-parameters for DP optimizers are critical; (2) pre-training on public data significantly mitigates the accuracy and robustness drop; (3) choice of DP optimizers makes a difference. With these factors set properly, we achieve 90\\% natural accuracy, 72\\% robust accuracy ($+9\\%$ than the non-private model) under $l_2(0.5)$ attack, and 69\\% robust accuracy ($+16\\%$ than the non-private model) with pre-trained SimCLRv2 model under $l_\\infty(4/255)$ attack on CIFAR10 with $\\epsilon=2$.

Empirically, the robustness of DP models is consistently observed across various datasets and models. We believe our encouraging results are a significant step towards training models that are private as well as robust",

    "title": "Low Dimensional Invariant Embeddings for Universal Geometric Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This paper studies separating invariants: mappings on $D$ dimensional domains which are invariant to an appropriate group action, and which separate orbits. The motivation for this study comes from the usefulness of separating invariants in proving universality of equivariant neural network architectures. We observe that in several cases the cardinality of separating invariants proposed in the machine learning literature is much larger than the dimension $D$. As a result, the theoretical universal constructions based on these separating invariants is unrealistically large. Our goal in this paper is to resolve this issue. We show that when a continuous family of semi-algebraic separating invariants is available, separation can be obtained by randomly selecting $2D+1 $ of these invariants. We apply this methodology to obtain an efficient scheme for computing separating invariants for several classical group actions which have been studied in the invariant learning literature. Examples include matrix multiplication actions on point clouds by permutations, rotations, and various other linear groups. Often the requirement of invariant separation is relaxed and only generic separation is required. In this case, we show that only $D+1$ invariants are required. More importantly, generic invariants are often significantly easier to compute, as we illustrate by discussing generic and full separation for weighted graphs. Finally we outline an approach for proving that separating invariants can be constructed also when the random parameters have finite precision",

    "abstract": "Group fairness is a central research topic in text classification, where reaching fair treatment between sensitive groups (e.g. women vs. men) remains an open challenge. This paper presents a novel method for mitigating biases in neural text classification, agnostic to the model architecture. Considering the difficulty to distinguish fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we take inspiration from adversarial training to induce Wasserstein independence between representations learned to predict our target label and the ones learned to predict some sensitive attribute. Our approach provides two significant advantages. Firstly, it does not require annotations of sensitive attributes in both testing and training data. This is more suitable for real-life scenarios compared to existing methods that require annotations of sensitive attributes at train time. Second, our approach exhibits a comparable or better fairness-accuracy trade-off compared to existing methods",

We focus on combining Bayesian deep learning with split conformal prediction and how this combination effects out-of-distribution coverage; particularly in the case of multiclass image classification. We suggest that if the model is generally underconfident on the calibration set, then the resultant conformal sets may exhibit worse out-of-distribution coverage compared to simple predictive credible sets. Conversely, if the model is overconfident on the calibration set, the use of conformal prediction may improve out-of-distribution coverage. We evaluate prediction sets as a result of combining split conformal methods and neural networks trained with (i) stochastic gradient descent, (ii) deep ensembles, and (iii) mean-field variational inference. Our results suggest that combining Bayesian deep learning models with split conformal prediction can, in some cases, cause unintended consequences such as reducing out-of-distribution coverage",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Modern applications are increasingly driven by Machine Learning (ML) models whose non-deterministic behavior is affecting the entire application life cycle from design to operation. The pervasive adoption of ML is urgently calling for approaches that guarantee a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications over time and across model changes. To this aim, non-functional properties of ML models, such as privacy, confidentiality, fairness, and explainability, must be monitored, verified, and maintained. This need is even more pressing when modern applications operate in the edge-cloud continuum, increasing their complexity and dynamicity. Existing approaches mostly focus on i) implementing classifier selection solutions according to the functional behavior of ML models, ii) finding new algorithmic solutions to this need, such as continuous re-training. In this paper, we propose a multi-model approach built on dynamic classifier selection, where multiple ML models showing similar non-functional properties are made available to the application and one model is selected over time according to (dynamic and unpredictable) contextual changes. Our solution goes beyond the state of the art by providing an architectural and methodological approach that continuously guarantees a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications, is applicable to different ML models, and is driven by non-functional properties assessed on the models themselves. It consists of a two-step process working during application operation, where model assessment verifies non-functional properties of ML models trained and selected at development time, and model substitution guarantees a continuous and stable support of non-functional properties. We experimentally evaluate our solution in a real-world scenario focusing on non-functional property fairness",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The unequal representation of different groups in a sample population can lead to discrimination of minority groups when machine learning models make automated decisions. To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning jointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and low unfairness. However, the inherent under-representation of minorities in the data makes the disparate treatment of subpopulations less noticeable and difficult to deal with during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting method to address such \\emph{representation bias}. To balance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our approach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical risk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the minority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance. Our theoretical analysis shows the effectiveness of our adversarial reweighting approach. Experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates bias without sacrificing classification accuracy, outperforming related state-of-the-art methods on image and tabular benchmark datasets",

Our novel interpretation-based approach is implemented after completion of model prediction by analyzing the same source of unstructured data to measure importance attributed to the video features. We eliminate several spurious relationships in two steps, identifying a subset of relationships which are confirmed using theory. We uncover novel findings that establish distinct associations for measures of shallow and deep engagement based on the dual-system framework of human thinking.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

These interpretations also cover the Extractor, a family of drop-in replacements for the multi-head self-attention in the Transformer architecture. Then, we propose an improvement on a type of the Extractor that outperforms the self-attention, without introducing additional trainable parameters.

We test our approach on the Opportunity and MM-Fit datasets. In MM-Fit we show significant improvement over the baseline supervised and self-supervised method SimCLR, while for Opportunity there is significant improvement over the supervised baseline and slight improvement when compared to SimCLR. Moreover, our method improves supervised baselines even when using only a small amount of the data for training.

Learning on graph models have drawn special attention as they can significantly reduce drug repurposing costs and time commitment. However, many current approaches require high-demanding additional information besides DTIs that complicates their evaluation process and usability. Additionally, structural differences in the learning architecture of current models hinder their fair benchmarking. In this work, we first perform an in-depth evaluation of current DTI datasets and prediction models through a robust benchmarking process, and show that DTI prediction methods based on transductive models lack generalization and lead to inflated performance when evaluated as previously done in the literature, hence not being suited for drug repurposing approaches. We then propose a novel biologically-driven strategy for negative edge subsampling and show through in vitro validation that newly discovered interactions are indeed true.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned using human comparison data with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods to make them better aligned with users' preferences. In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful.

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates, vital components of biological systems, are well-known for their structural diversity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a crucial role in understanding their intricate molecular arrangements and is essential in assessing and verifying the molecular structure of organic molecules. An important part of this process is to predict the NMR chemical shift from the molecular structure. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages E(3) equivariant graph neural networks to predict carbohydrate NMR spectra. Notably, our model achieves a substantial reduction in mean absolute error, up to threefold, compared to traditional models that rely solely on two-dimensional molecular structure. Even with limited data, the model excels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities. The implications are far-reaching and go beyond an advanced understanding of carbohydrate structures and spectral interpretation. For example, it could accelerate research in pharmaceutical applications, biochemistry, and structural biology, offering a faster and more reliable analysis of molecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is a key step towards a new data-driven era in spectroscopy, potentially influencing spectroscopic techniques beyond NMR",

    "abstract": "In a multi-channel separation task with multiple speakers, we aim to recover all individual speech signals from the mixture. In contrast to single-channel approaches, which rely on the different spectro-temporal characteristics of the speech signals, multi-channel approaches should additionally utilize the different spatial locations of the sources for a more powerful separation especially when the number of sources increases. To enhance the spatial processing in a multi-channel source separation scenario, in this work, we propose a deep neural network (DNN) based spatially selective filter (SSF) that can be spatially steered to extract the speaker of interest by initializing a recurrent neural network layer with the target direction. We compare the proposed SSF with a common end-to-end direct separation (DS) approach trained using utterance-wise permutation invariant training (PIT), which only implicitly learns to perform spatial filtering. We show that the SSF has a clear advantage over a DS approach with the same underlying network architecture when there are more than two speakers in the mixture, which can be attributed to a better use of the spatial information. Furthermore, we find that the SSF generalizes much better to additional noise sources that were not seen during training and to scenarios with speakers positioned at a similar angle",

Here, we derive a taxonomy of graph transformer architectures, bringing some order to this emerging field. We overview their theoretical properties, survey structural and positional encodings, and discuss extensions for important graph classes, e.g., 3D molecular graphs.

    "title": "Computing Approximate $\\ell_p$ Sensitivities",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recent works in dimensionality reduction for regression tasks have introduced the notion of sensitivity, an estimate of the importance of a specific datapoint in a dataset, offering provable guarantees on the quality of the approximation after removing low-sensitivity datapoints via subsampling. However, fast algorithms for approximating $\\ell_p$ sensitivities, which we show is equivalent to approximate $\\ell_p$ regression, are known for only the $\\ell_2$ setting, in which they are termed leverage scores. In this work, we provide efficient algorithms for approximating $\\ell_p$ sensitivities and related summary statistics of a given matrix. In particular, for a given $n \\times d$ matrix, we compute $\\alpha$-approximation to its $\\ell_1$ sensitivities at the cost of $O(n/\\alpha)$ sensitivity computations. For estimating the total $\\ell_p$ sensitivity (i.e. the sum of $\\ell_p$ sensitivities), we provide an algorithm based on importance sampling of $\\ell_p$ Lewis weights, which computes a constant factor approximation to the total sensitivity at the cost of roughly $O(\\sqrt{d})$ sensitivity computations. Furthermore, we estimate the maximum $\\ell_1$ sensitivity, up to a $\\sqrt{d}$ factor, using $O(d)$ sensitivity computations. We generalize all these results to $\\ell_p$ norms for $p > 1$. Lastly, we experimentally show that for a wide class of matrices in real-world datasets, the total sensitivity can be quickly approximated and is significantly smaller than the theoretical prediction, demonstrating that real-world datasets have low intrinsic effective dimensionality",

    "title": "FedDRO: Federated Compositional Optimization for Distributionally Robust Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recently, compositional optimization (CO) has gained popularity because of its applications in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and many other machine learning problems. Large-scale and distributed availability of data demands the development of efficient federated learning (FL) algorithms for solving CO problems. Developing FL algorithms for CO is particularly challenging because of the compositional nature of the objective. Moreover, current state-of-the-art methods to solve such problems rely on large batch gradients (depending on the solution accuracy) not feasible for most practical settings. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose efficient FedAvg-type algorithms for solving non-convex CO in the FL setting. We first establish that vanilla FedAvg is not suitable to solve distributed CO problems because of the data heterogeneity in the compositional objective at each client which leads to the amplification of bias in the local compositional gradient estimates. To this end, we propose a novel FL framework FedDRO that utilizes the DRO problem structure to design a communication strategy that allows FedAvg to control the bias in the estimation of the compositional gradient. A key novelty of our work is to develop solution accuracy-independent algorithms that do not require large batch gradients (and function evaluations) for solving federated CO problems. We establish $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ communication complexity in the FL setting while achieving linear speedup with the number of clients. We corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical studies on large-scale DRO problems",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Offline-to-online RL can make full use of pre-collected offline datasets to initialize policies, resulting in higher sample efficiency and better performance compared to only using online algorithms alone for policy training. However, direct fine-tuning of the pre-trained policy tends to result in sub-optimal performance. A primary reason is that conservative offline RL methods diminish the agent's capability of exploration, thereby impacting online fine-tuning performance. To encourage agent's exploration during online fine-tuning and enhance the overall online fine-tuning performance, we propose a generalized reward augmentation method called Sample Efficient Reward Augmentation (SERA). Specifically, SERA encourages agent to explore by computing Q conditioned entropy as intrinsic reward. The advantage of SERA is that it can extensively utilize offline pre-trained Q to encourage agent uniformly coverage of state space while considering the imbalance between the distributions of high-value and low-value states. Additionally, SERA can be effortlessly plugged into various RL algorithms to improve online fine-tuning and ensure sustained asymptotic improvement. Moreover, extensive experimental results demonstrate that when conducting offline-to-online problems, SERA consistently and effectively enhances the performance of various offline algorithms",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting top-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph representations. However, this paper highlights two key issues with these methods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs additional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a thorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and subsequent prediction tasks. 2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly discard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the latent information contained within these elements. To address the first issue, we introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects nodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final representation vectors crucial for classification. The second issue is addressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies a uniform loss on the discarded nodes. This addition is designed to augment the training process and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our proposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets. Our experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14 baseline methods for most datasets. Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances GrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs",

    "title": "How Can We Train Deep Learning Models Across Clouds and Continents? An Experimental Study",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Training deep learning models in the cloud or on dedicated hardware is expensive. A more cost-efficient option are hyperscale clouds offering spot instances, a cheap but ephemeral alternative to on-demand resources. As spot instance availability can change depending on the time of day, continent, and cloud provider, it could be more cost-efficient to distribute resources over the world. Still, it has not been investigated whether geo-distributed, data-parallel spot deep learning training could be a more cost-efficient alternative to centralized training. This paper aims to answer the question: Can deep learning models be cost-efficiently trained on a global market of spot VMs spanning different data centers and cloud providers? To provide guidance, we extensively evaluate the cost and throughput implications of training in different zones, continents, and clouds for representative CV, NLP and ASR models. To expand the current training options further, we compare the scalability potential for hybrid-cloud scenarios by adding cloud resources to on-premise hardware to improve training throughput. Finally, we show how leveraging spot instance pricing enables a new cost-efficient way to train models with multiple cheap VMs, trumping both more centralized and powerful hardware and even on-demand cloud offerings at competitive prices",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning technique that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train models without requiring clients to reveal their raw data to each other. Although traditional FL trains a single global model with average performance among clients, statistical data heterogeneity across clients has resulted in the development of personalized FL (PFL), which trains personalized models with good performance on each client's data. A key challenge with PFL is how to facilitate clients with similar data to collaborate more in a situation where each client has data from complex distribution and cannot determine one another's distribution. In this paper, we propose a new PFL method (pFedMB) using multi-branch architecture, which achieves personalization by splitting each layer of a neural network into multiple branches and assigning client-specific weights to each branch. We also design an aggregation method to improve the communication efficiency and the model performance, with which each branch is globally updated with weighted averaging by client-specific weights assigned to the branch. pFedMB is simple but effective in facilitating each client to share knowledge with similar clients by adjusting the weights assigned to each branch. We experimentally show that pFedMB performs better than the state-of-the-art PFL methods using the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets",

Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to learn from its own mistakes. To address this, we equip Koopman methods - developed for predicting non-stationary time-series - with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data.

Leveraging insights from this framework, we propose methods to improve both MoEs and PKMs. Unlike prior work that compares MoEs with dense baselines under the compute-equal condition, our evaluation condition is parameter-equal, which is crucial to properly evaluate LMs. We show that our MoEs are competitive with the dense Transformer-XL on both the WikiText-103 and enwiki8 datasets at two different scales, while being much more resource efficient. This demonstrates that MoEs are relevant not only to extremely large LMs but also to any-scale resource-efficient LMs. Our code is public",

The goal, inspired by Blackwell's Approachability Theorem, is to lower the time average cost of each agent to below a pre-specified agent-specific bound. For the MMDP, we assume the state dynamics to be controlled by the joint actions of agents, but the per-stage costs to only depend on the individual agent's actions. We combine the Q-learning algorithm for a weighted combination of the costs of each agent, obtained by a gossip algorithm with the Metropolis-Hastings or Multiplicative Weights formalisms to modulate the averaging matrix of the gossip. We use multiple timescales in our algorithm and prove that under mild conditions, it approximately achieves the desired bounds for each of the agents. We also demonstrate the empirical performance of this algorithm in the more general setting of MMDPs having jointly controlled per-stage costs",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Given the inevitability of domain shifts during inference in real-world applications, test-time adaptation (TTA) is essential for model adaptation after deployment. However, the real-world scenario of continuously changing target distributions presents challenges including catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation. Existing TTA methods for non-stationary domain shifts, while effective, incur excessive computational load, making them impractical for on-device settings. In this paper, we introduce a layer-wise auto-weighting algorithm for continual and gradual TTA that autonomously identifies layers for preservation or concentrated adaptation. By leveraging the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), we first design the learning weight to selectively focus on layers associated with log-likelihood changes while preserving unrelated ones. Then, we further propose an exponential min-max scaler to make certain layers nearly frozen while mitigating outliers. This minimizes forgetting and error accumulation, leading to efficient adaptation to non-stationary target distribution. Experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C show our method outperforms conventional continual and gradual TTA approaches while significantly reducing computational load, highlighting the importance of FIM-based learning weight in adapting to continuously or gradually shifting target domains",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (HUDA) is the most challenging domain adaptation setting where the feature spaces of source and target domains are heterogeneous, and the target domain has only unlabeled data. Existing HUDA methods assume that both positive and negative examples are available in the source domain, which may not be satisfied in some real applications. This paper addresses a new challenging setting called positive and unlabeled heterogeneous unsupervised domain adaptation (PU-HUDA), a HUDA setting where the source domain only has positives. PU-HUDA can also be viewed as an extension of PU learning where the positive and unlabeled examples are sampled from different domains. A naive combination of existing HUDA and PU learning methods is ineffective in PU-HUDA due to the gap in label distribution between the source and target domains. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel method, predictive adversarial domain adaptation (PADA), which can predict likely positive examples from the unlabeled target data and simultaneously align the feature spaces to reduce the distribution divergence between the whole source data and the likely positive target data. PADA achieves this by a unified adversarial training framework for learning a classifier to predict positive examples and a feature transformer to transform the target feature space to that of the source. Specifically, they are both trained to fool a common discriminator that determines whether the likely positive examples are from the target or source domain. We experimentally show that PADA outperforms several baseline methods, such as the naive combination of HUDA and PU learning",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

    "abstract": "Association rule mining techniques can generate a large volume of sequential data when implemented on transactional databases. Extracting insights from a large set of association rules has been found to be a challenging process. When examining a ruleset, the fundamental question is how to summarise and represent meaningful mined knowledge efficiently. Many algorithms and strategies have been developed to address issue of knowledge extraction; however, the effectiveness of this process can be limited by the data structures. A better data structure can sufficiently affect the speed of the knowledge extraction process. This paper proposes a novel data structure, called the Trie of rules, for storing a ruleset that is generated by association rule mining. The resulting data structure is a prefix-tree graph structure made of pre-mined rules. This graph stores the rules as paths within the prefix-tree in a way that similar rules overlay each other. Each node in the tree represents a rule where a consequent is this node, and an antecedent is a path from this node to the root of the tree. The evaluation showed that the proposed representation technique is promising. It compresses a ruleset with almost no data loss and benefits in terms of time for basic operations such as searching for a specific rule and sorting, which is the base for many knowledge discovery methods. Moreover, our method demonstrated a significant improvement in traversing time, achieving an 8-fold increase compared to traditional data structures",

The task of identifying reliable biomarkers to classify Schizophrenia accurately continues to be a challenge in the field of psychiatry. We investigate the temporal patterns within the motor activity data as a potential key to enhancing the categorization of individuals with Schizophrenia, using the dataset having motor activity recordings of 22 Schizophrenia patients and 32 control subjects. The dataset contains per-minute motor activity measurements collected for an average of 12.7 days in a row for each participant. We dissect each day into segments (Twelve, Eight, six, four, three, and two parts) and evaluate their impact on classification. We employ sixteen statistical features within these temporal segments and train them on Seven machine learning models to get deeper insights. LightGBM model outperforms the other six models. Our results indicate that the temporal segmentation significantly improves the classification, with AUC-ROC = 0.93, F1 score = 0.84( LightGBM- without any segmentation) and AUC-ROC = 0.98, F1 score = 0.93( LightGBM- with segmentation). Distinguishing between diurnal and nocturnal segments amplifies the differences between Schizophrenia patients and controls. However, further subdivisions into smaller time segments do not affect the AUC- ROC significantly. Morning, afternoon, evening, and night partitioning gives similar classification performance to day-night partitioning. These findings are valuable as they indicate that extensive temporal classification beyond distinguishing between day and night does not yield substantial results, offering an efficient approach for further classification, early diagnosis, and monitoring of Schizophrenia",

    "title": "Improving Source-Free Target Adaptation with Vision Transformers Leveraging Domain Representation Images",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel in supervised learning tasks but are constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Self-supervised learning emerges as a promising alternative, allowing models to learn without explicit labels. Information theory, and notably the information bottleneck principle, has been pivotal in shaping deep neural networks. This principle focuses on optimizing the trade-off between compression and preserving relevant information, providing a foundation for efficient network design in supervised contexts. However, its precise role and adaptation in self-supervised learning remain unclear. In this work, we scrutinize various self-supervised learning approaches from an information-theoretic perspective, introducing a unified framework that encapsulates the \\textit{self-supervised information-theoretic learning problem}. We weave together existing research into a cohesive narrative, delve into contemporary self-supervised methodologies, and spotlight potential research avenues and inherent challenges. Additionally, we discuss the empirical evaluation of information-theoretic quantities and their estimation methods.

    "title": "Revisiting the Domain Shift and Sample Uncertainty in Multi-source Active Domain Transfer",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a new target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to annotate.This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to target a new and challenging setting of knowledge transfer that extends ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains, termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly, we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting, mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains and thus their uncertainty-aware sample selection can easily become miscalibrated under the multi-domain shifts. Considering this, we propose a Dynamic integrated uncertainty valuation framework(Detective) that comprehensively consider the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domain to detect the informative target samples. Specifically, the leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation(DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then comprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning, thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Furthermore, we introduce a contextual diversity-aware calculator to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin on three domain adaptation benchmarks",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Big data and large-scale machine learning have had a profound impact on science and engineering, particularly in fields focused on forecasting and prediction. Yet, it is still not clear how we can use the superior pattern matching abilities of machine learning models for scientific discovery. This is because the goals of machine learning and science are generally not aligned. In addition to being accurate, scientific theories must also be causally consistent with the underlying physical process and allow for human analysis, reasoning, and manipulation to advance the field. In this paper, we present a case study on discovering a new symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from data using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection, and symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal features from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while selecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic regression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that retains the neural network's predictive capabilities, while allowing for interpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model reproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and achieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory. This showcases how machine learning can facilitate inductive scientific discovery, and paves the way for more accurate rogue wave forecasting",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has attracted a large amount of attention from the machine learning research community in recent years due to its importance in deployed systems. Most of the previous studies focused on the detection of OOD samples in the multi-class classification task. However, OOD detection in the multi-label classification task, a more common real-world use case, remains an underexplored domain. In this research, we propose YolOOD - a method that utilizes concepts from the object detection domain to perform OOD detection in the multi-label classification task. Object detection models have an inherent ability to distinguish between objects of interest (in-distribution) and irrelevant objects (e.g., OOD objects) in images that contain multiple objects belonging to different class categories. These abilities allow us to convert a regular object detection model into an image classifier with inherent OOD detection capabilities with just minor changes. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and demonstrate YolOOD's ability to outperform these methods on a comprehensive suite of in-distribution and OOD benchmark datasets",

Despite advancements, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (MI) tasks face challenges like amplitude and phase variability, and complex spatial correlations, with a need for smaller model size and faster inference. This study introduces the LGL-BCI framework, employing a Geometric Deep Learning Framework for EEG processing in non-Euclidean metric spaces, particularly the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) Manifold space. LGL-BCI offers robust EEG data representation and captures spatial correlations. We propose an EEG channel selection solution via a feature decomposition algorithm to reduce SPD matrix dimensionality, with a lossless transformation boosting inference speed. Extensive experiments show LGL-BCI's superior accuracy and efficiency compared to current solutions, highlighting geometric deep learning's potential in MI-BCI applications. The efficiency, assessed on two public EEG datasets and two real-world EEG devices, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in accuracy ($82.54\\%$ versus $62.22\\%$) with fewer parameters (64.9M compared to 183.7M)",

    "abstract": "The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Categorical random variables can faithfully represent the discrete and uncertain aspects of data as part of a discrete latent variable model. Learning in such models necessitates taking gradients with respect to the parameters of the categorical probability distributions, which is often intractable due to their combinatorial nature. A popular technique to estimate these otherwise intractable gradients is the Log-Derivative trick. This trick forms the basis of the well-known REINFORCE gradient estimator and its many extensions. While the Log-Derivative trick allows us to differentiate through samples drawn from categorical distributions, it does not take into account the discrete nature of the distribution itself. Our first contribution addresses this shortcoming by introducing the CatLog-Derivative trick - a variation of the Log-Derivative trick tailored towards categorical distributions. Secondly, we use the CatLog-Derivative trick to introduce IndeCateR, a novel and unbiased gradient estimator for the important case of products of independent categorical distributions with provably lower variance than REINFORCE. Thirdly, we empirically show that IndeCateR can be efficiently implemented and that its gradient estimates have significantly lower bias and variance for the same number of samples compared to the state of the art",

We parameterize this mixture distribution as a spline normalizing flow, which we train using variational inference. The proposed form of the variational posterior enables a sparse variational elliptical process applicable to large-scale problems.

    "abstract": "In multi-lingual societies, where multiple languages are spoken in a small geographic vicinity, informal conversations often involve mix of languages. Existing speech technologies may be inefficient in extracting information from such conversations, where the speech data is rich in diversity with multiple languages and speakers. The DISPLACE (DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments) challenge constitutes an open-call for evaluating and bench-marking the speaker and language diarization technologies on this challenging condition. The challenge entailed two tracks: Track-1 focused on speaker diarization (SD) in multilingual situations while, Track-2 addressed the language diarization (LD) in a multi-speaker scenario. Both the tracks were evaluated using the same underlying audio data. To facilitate this evaluation, a real-world dataset featuring multilingual, multi-speaker conversational far-field speech was recorded and distributed. Furthermore, a baseline system was made available for both SD and LD task which mimicked the state-of-art in these tasks. The challenge garnered a total of $42$ world-wide registrations and received a total of $19$ combined submissions for Track-1 and Track-2. This paper describes the challenge, details of the datasets, tasks, and the baseline system. Additionally, the paper provides a concise overview of the submitted systems in both tracks, with an emphasis given to the top performing systems. The paper also presents insights and future perspectives for SD and LD tasks, focusing on the key challenges that the systems need to overcome before wide-spread commercial deployment on such conversations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in integrating machine learning techniques and optimization to solve challenging optimization problems. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning methodology for the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP). The aim is to build up a greedy-like heuristic able to learn on some distribution of JSSP instances, different in the number of jobs and machines. The need for fast scheduling methods is well known, and it arises in many areas, from transportation to healthcare. We model the JSSP as a Markov Decision Process and then we exploit the efficacy of reinforcement learning to solve the problem. We adopt an actor-critic scheme, where the action taken by the agent is influenced by policy considerations on the state-value function. The procedures are adapted to take into account the challenging nature of JSSP, where the state and the action space change not only for every instance but also after each decision. To tackle the variability in the number of jobs and operations in the input, we modeled the agent using two incident LSTM models, a special type of deep neural network. Experiments show the algorithm reaches good solutions in a short time, proving that is possible to generate new greedy heuristics just from learning-based methodologies. Benchmarks have been generated in comparison with the commercial solver CPLEX. As expected, the model can generalize, to some extent, to larger problems or instances originated by a different distribution from the one used in training",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

TinyML, the deployment of machine learning (ML) algorithms onto low-cost, low-power microcontroller systems, enables on-device sensor analytics that unlocks numerous always-on ML applications. This article discusses both the potential of these TinyML applications to address critical sustainability challenges, as well as the environmental footprint of this emerging technology. Through a complete life cycle analysis (LCA), we find that TinyML systems present opportunities to offset their carbon emissions by enabling applications that reduce the emissions of other sectors. Nevertheless, when globally scaled, the carbon footprint of TinyML systems is not negligible, necessitating that designers factor in environmental impact when formulating new devices.

To address these issues, we firstly introduce a concentrated loss function based on an adaptive calibration kernel that reweights the simulated data appropriately to improve the data efficiency. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the variance of associated Monte Carlo estimators. Based on this analysis, we then propose several variance reduction techniques to further accelerate the process of learning.

The framework of regularisation by projection is then used to find a reconstruction. The second one uses a simplified model of the physics of the measurement process and only relies on the training data to learn a model correction.

    "title": "Enhancing Multi-modal Cooperation via Fine-grained Modality Valuation",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "One primary topic of multi-modal learning is to jointly incorporate heterogeneous information from different modalities. However, most models often suffer from unsatisfactory multi-modal cooperation, which could not jointly utilize all modalities well. Some methods are proposed to identify and enhance the worse learnt modality, but are often hard to provide the fine-grained observation of multi-modal cooperation at sample-level with theoretical support. Hence, it is essential to reasonably observe and improve the fine-grained cooperation between modalities, especially when facing realistic scenarios where the modality discrepancy could vary across different samples. To this end, we introduce a fine-grained modality valuation metric to evaluate the contribution of each modality at sample-level. Via modality valuation, we regretfully observe that the multi-modal model tends to rely on one specific modality, resulting in other modalities being low-contributing. We further analyze this issue and improve cooperation between modalities by enhancing the discriminative ability of low-contributing modalities in a targeted manner. Overall, our methods reasonably observe the fine-grained uni-modal contribution at sample-level and achieve considerable improvement on different multi-modal models",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This study concentrates on evaluating the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare, with a specific focus on their application in personal anomalous health monitoring. Our research primarily investigates the capabilities of LLMs in interpreting and analyzing physiological data obtained from FDA-approved devices. We conducted an extensive analysis using anomalous physiological data gathered in a simulated low-air-pressure plateau environment. This allowed us to assess the precision and reliability of LLMs in understanding and evaluating users' health status with notable specificity. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit exceptional performance in determining medical indicators, including a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than 1 beat per minute for heart rate and less than 1% for oxygen saturation (SpO2). Furthermore, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) for these evaluations remained below 1%, with the overall accuracy of health assessments surpassing 85%. In image analysis tasks, such as interpreting photoplethysmography (PPG) data, our specially adapted GPT models demonstrated remarkable proficiency, achieving less than 1 bpm error in cycle count and 7.28 MAE for heart rate estimation. This study highlights LLMs' dual role as health data analysis tools and pivotal elements in advanced AI health assistants, offering personalized health insights and recommendations within the future health assistant framework",

    "title": "Local Convolution Enhanced Global Fourier Neural Operator For Multiscale Dynamic Spaces Prediction",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Neural operators extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by allowing them to handle mappings between function spaces for the purpose of solving partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which is inspired by Green's function method and approximate operator kernel directly in the frequency domain. In this work, we focus on predicting multiscale dynamic spaces, which is equivalent to solving multiscale PDEs. Multiscale PDEs are characterized by rapid coefficient changes and solution space oscillations, which are crucial for modeling atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To solve this problem, models should have the ability to capture rapid changes and process them at various scales. However, the FNO only approximates kernels in the low-frequency domain, which is insufficient when solving multiscale PDEs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical neural operator that integrates improved Fourier layers with attention mechanisms, aiming to capture all details and handle them at various scales. These mechanisms complement each other in the frequency domain and encourage the model to solve multiscale problems. We perform experiments on dynamic spaces governed by forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations and some other physical scenarios, and reach superior performance in existing PDE benchmarks, especially equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations",

    "title": "From Microbes to Methane: AI-Based Predictive Modeling of Feed Additive Efficacy in Dairy Cows",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In an era of increasing pressure to achieve sustainable agriculture, the optimization of livestock feed for enhancing yield and minimizing environmental impact is a paramount objective. This study presents a pioneering approach towards this goal, using rumen microbiome data to predict the efficacy of feed additives in dairy cattle. We collected an extensive dataset that includes methane emissions from 2,190 Holstein cows distributed across 34 distinct sites. The cows were divided into control and experimental groups in a double-blind, unbiased manner, accounting for variables such as age, days in lactation, and average milk yield. The experimental groups were administered one of four leading commercial feed additives: Agolin, Kexxtone, Allimax, and Relyon. Methane emissions were measured individually both before the administration of additives and over a subsequent 12-week period. To develop our predictive model for additive efficacy, rumen microbiome samples were collected from 510 cows from the same herds prior to the study's onset. These samples underwent deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing, yielding an average of 15.7 million reads per sample. Utilizing innovative artificial intelligence techniques we successfully estimated the efficacy of these feed additives across different farms. The model's robustness was further confirmed through validation with independent cohorts, affirming its generalizability and reliability. Our results underscore the transformative capability of using targeted feed additive strategies to both optimize dairy yield and milk composition, and to significantly reduce methane emissions. Specifically, our predictive model demonstrates a scenario where its application could guide the assignment of additives to farms where they are most effective. In doing so, we could achieve an average potential reduction of over 27\\% in overall emissions",

    "title": "Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition: A taxonomy and framework",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends traditional RL by seeking policies making different compromises among conflicting objectives. The recent surge of interest in MORL has led to diverse studies and solving methods, often drawing from existing knowledge in multi-objective optimization based on decomposition (MOO/D). Yet, a clear categorization based on both RL and MOO/D is lacking in the existing literature. Consequently, MORL researchers face difficulties when trying to classify contributions within a broader context due to the absence of a standardized taxonomy. To tackle such an issue, this paper introduces Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition (MORL/D), a novel methodology bridging RL and MOO literature. A comprehensive taxonomy for MORL/D is presented, providing a structured foundation for categorizing existing and potential MORL works. The introduced taxonomy is then used to scrutinize MORL research, enhancing clarity and conciseness through well-defined categorization. Moreover, a flexible framework derived from the taxonomy is introduced. This framework accommodates diverse instantiations using tools from both RL and MOO/D. Implementation across various configurations demonstrates its versatility, assessed against benchmark problems. Results indicate MORL/D instantiations achieve comparable performance with significantly greater versatility than current state-of-the-art approaches. By presenting the taxonomy and framework, this paper offers a comprehensive perspective and a unified vocabulary for MORL. This not only facilitates the identification of algorithmic contributions but also lays the groundwork for novel research avenues in MORL, contributing to the continued advancement of this field",

    "abstract": "This research delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and its associated blockchain, which records all transactions since its inception. While this ensures integrity and transparency, the transparent nature of Bitcoin potentially compromises users' privacy rights. To address this concern, users have adopted CoinJoin, a method that amalgamates multiple transaction intents into a single, larger transaction to bolster transactional privacy. This process complicates individual transaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis heuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on identifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin implementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting distinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study delves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming to develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the blockchain. Our exhaustive analysis covers transactions up to block 760,000, offering a comprehensive insight into CoinJoin transactions and their implications for Bitcoin blockchain analysis",

A model is a polynomial function of a space-time signal designed to well-approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), even in low regularity regimes. Models can be seen as natural multi-dimensional generalisations of signatures of paths; our work therefore aims to extend the recent use of signatures in data science beyond the context of time-ordered data. We provide a flexible definition of a model feature vector associated to a space-time signal, along with two algorithms which illustrate ways in which these features can be combined with linear regression. We apply these algorithms in several numerical experiments designed to learn solutions to PDEs with a given forcing and boundary data. Our experiments include semi-linear parabolic and wave equations with forcing, and Burgers' equation with no forcing. We find an advantage in favour of our algorithms when compared to several alternative methods. Additionally, in the experiment with Burgers' equation, we find non-trivial predictive power when noise is added to the observations",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have enabled high-fidelity scene reconstruction for novel view synthesis. However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

This paper illustrates a use case for an industrial partner, where Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) images are first reconstructed with a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (VQGAN) trained on normal products. Then, several multi-level metrics are extracted on a few normal and abnormal images, highlighting anomalies through reconstruction differences. Finally, a classifer is trained to build a composite anomaly score thanks to the metrics extracted. This three-step approach is performed on the public MVTec-AD datasets and on the partner PCBA dataset, where it achieves a regular accuracy of 95.69% and 87.93% under the ZFN constraint",

Attribution maps from xAI techniques, such as Integrated Gradients, are a typical example of a visualization technique containing a high level of information, but with difficult interpretation. In this paper, we propose two methods, Maximum Activation Groups Extraction (MAGE) and Multiscale Interpretable Visualization (Ms-IV), to explain the model's decision, enhancing global interpretability. MAGE finds, for a given CNN, combinations of features which, globally, form a semantic meaning, that we call concepts. We group these similar feature patterns by clustering in ``concepts'', that we visualize through Ms-IV. This last method is inspired by Occlusion and Sensitivity analysis (incorporating causality), and uses a novel metric, called Class-aware Order Correlation (CaOC), to globally evaluate the most important image regions according to the model's decision space. We compare our approach to xAI methods such as LIME and Integrated Gradients. Experimental results evince the Ms-IV higher localization and faithfulness values. Finally, qualitative evaluation of combined MAGE and Ms-IV demonstrates humans' ability to agree, based on the visualization, with the decision of clusters' concepts; and, to detect, among a given set of networks, the existence of bias",

Under this assumption, which leads to a generalization of the ERM-RER problem allowing a larger degree of flexibility for incorporating prior knowledge, numerous relevant properties are stated. Among these properties, the solution to this problem, if it exists, is shown to be a unique probability measure, often mutually absolutely continuous with the reference measure. Such a solution exhibits a probably-approximately-correct guarantee for the ERM problem independently of whether the latter possesses a solution. For a fixed dataset, the empirical risk is shown to be a sub-Gaussian random variable when the models are sampled from the solution to the ERM-RER problem. The generalization capabilities of the solution to the ERM-RER problem (the Gibbs algorithm) are studied via the sensitivity of the expected empirical risk to deviations from such a solution towards alternative probability measures.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the internet, which contains both factual and misleading information about the world. Can language models discern truth from falsehood in this contradicting data? Expanding on the view that LLMs can model different communicative agents, we present the persona hypothesis: LLMs can cluster agents into personas using common features of their generations. For instance, a truthful persona is a group of agents that are likely to produce truthful text and that share similar features like formal writing styles and scientific references. By modeling this persona, LLMs can generalize truthfulness beyond the specific contexts in which each agent generated the training text. For example, the model can infer that the agent ``Wikipedia'' will behave truthfully on topics that were only generated by ``Science'' because they both belong to the truthful persona. We show evidence for the persona hypothesis via two observations: (1) we can probe whether a model's answer will be truthful before it is generated; (2) finetuning a model on a set of facts improves its truthfulness on unseen topics. Next, using arithmetics as a synthetic environment, we show that language models can separate true and false statements, and generalize truthfulness across agents; but only if agents in the training data share a truthful generative process that enables the creation of a truthful persona. Overall, our findings suggest that models can exploit hierarchical structures in the data to learn abstract concepts like truthfulness",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Model extraction attacks are designed to steal trained models with only query access, as is often provided through APIs that ML-as-a-Service providers offer. ML models are expensive to train, in part because data is hard to obtain, and a primary incentive for model extraction is to acquire a model while incurring less cost than training from scratch. Literature on model extraction commonly claims or presumes that the attacker is able to save on both data acquisition and labeling costs. We show that the attacker often does not. This is because current attacks implicitly rely on the adversary being able to sample from the victim model's data distribution. We thoroughly evaluate factors influencing the success of model extraction. We discover that prior knowledge of the attacker, i.e. access to in-distribution data, dominates other factors like the attack policy the adversary follows to choose which queries to make to the victim model API. Thus, an adversary looking to develop an equally capable model with a fixed budget has little practical incentive to perform model extraction, since for the attack to work they need to collect in-distribution data, saving only on the cost of labeling. With low labeling costs in the current market, the usefulness of such attacks is questionable. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the effect of prior knowledge needs to be explicitly decoupled from the attack policy. To this end, we propose a benchmark to evaluate attack policy directly",

One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims at calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy on a calibration set via monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning procedure, which allows achieving a calibration error of zero, but leaves open the issue of the effect on performance. In this paper, we first prove that IR preserves the convex hull of the ROC curve -- an essential performance metric for binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while controlling for overfitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel generalization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with K classes. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on the probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal to zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that preserves the K-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically that this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between reducing cross entropy loss and avoiding overfitting of the calibration set",

    "title": "Fair Enough? A map of the current limitations of the requirements to have \"fair'' algorithms",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In the recent years, the raise in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on one side encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for ``fair'' algorithms. We believe that while a lot of excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having ``fair'' algorithms is per s\\'e a nearly meaningless requirement, that needs to be complemented with a lot of additional societal choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus, and pinpoint a list of fundamental ambiguities and attention points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems",

    "title": "Interpreting Black-box Machine Learning Models for High Dimensional Datasets",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in a broad variety of application domains due to their effectiveness in modeling complex problems and handling high-dimensional datasets. Many real-life datasets, however, are of increasingly high dimensionality, where a large number of features may be irrelevant for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. The inclusion of such features would not only introduce unwanted noise but also increase computational complexity. Furthermore, due to high non-linearity and dependency among a large number of features, DNN models tend to be unavoidably opaque and perceived as black-box methods because of their not well-understood internal functioning. Their algorithmic complexity is often simply beyond the capacities of humans to understand the interplay among myriads of hyperparameters. A well-interpretable model can identify statistically significant features and explain the way they affect the model's outcome. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to improve the interpretability of black-box models for classification tasks in the case of high-dimensional datasets. First, we train a black-box model on a high-dimensional dataset to learn the embeddings on which the classification is performed. To decompose the inner working principles of the black-box model and to identify top-k important features, we employ different probing and perturbing techniques. We then approximate the behavior of the black-box model by means of an interpretable surrogate model on the top-k feature space. Finally, we derive decision rules and local explanations from the surrogate model to explain individual decisions. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods like TabNet and XGboost when tested on different datasets with varying dimensionality between 50 and 20,000 w.r.t metrics and explainability",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models often suffer from forgetting previously learned information when trained on new data. This problem is exacerbated in federated learning (FL), where the data is distributed and can change independently for each user. Many solutions are proposed to resolve this catastrophic forgetting in a centralized setting. However, they do not apply directly to FL because of its unique complexities, such as privacy concerns and resource limitations. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents a framework for $\\textbf{federated class incremental learning}$ that utilizes a generative model to synthesize samples from past distributions. This data can be later exploited alongside the training data to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. To preserve privacy, the generative model is trained on the server using data-free methods at the end of each task without requesting data from clients. Moreover, our solution does not demand the users to store old data or models, which gives them the freedom to join/leave the training at any time. Additionally, we introduce SuperImageNet, a new regrouping of the ImageNet dataset specifically tailored for federated continual learning.

    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

Typically routes are assigned a grade to inform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their progression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and physical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a difficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias",

    "abstract": "One of the major open problems in machine learning is to characterize generalization in the overparameterized regime, where most traditional generalization bounds become inconsistent even for overparameterized linear regression. In many scenarios, this failure can be attributed to obscuring the crucial interplay between the training algorithm and the underlying data distribution. This paper demonstrate that the generalization behavior of overparameterized model should be analyzed in a both data-relevant and algorithm-relevant manner. To make a formal characterization, We introduce a notion called data-algorithm compatibility, which considers the generalization behavior of the entire data-dependent training trajectory, instead of traditional last-iterate analysis. We validate our claim by studying the setting of solving overparameterized linear regression with gradient descent. Specifically, we perform a data-dependent trajectory analysis and derive a sufficient condition for compatibility in such a setting. Our theoretical results demonstrate that if we take early stopping iterates into consideration, generalization can hold with significantly weaker restrictions on the problem instance than the previous last-iterate analysis",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of diverse wireless services in 5G and beyond has led to the emergence of network slicing technologies. Among these, admission control plays a crucial role in achieving service-oriented optimization goals through the selective acceptance of service requests. Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) forms the foundation in many admission control approaches thanks to its effectiveness and flexibility, initial instability with excessive convergence delay of DRL models hinders their deployment in real-world networks. We propose a digital twin (DT) accelerated DRL solution to address this issue. Specifically, we first formulate the admission decision-making process as a semi-Markov decision process, which is subsequently simplified into an equivalent discrete-time Markov decision process to facilitate the implementation of DRL methods. A neural network-based DT is established with a customized output layer for queuing systems, trained through supervised learning, and then employed to assist the training phase of the DRL model. Extensive simulations show that the DT-accelerated DRL improves resource utilization by over 40% compared to the directly trained state-of-the-art dueling deep Q-learning model. This improvement is achieved while preserving the model's capability to optimize the long-term rewards of the admission process",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI",

Despite its success in certain domains, most existing methods estimate causal effects in an idealistic and simplistic way - ignoring the causal structure among short-term outcomes and treating all of them as surrogates. However, such methods cannot be well applied to real-world scenarios, in which the partially observed surrogates are mixed with their proxies among short-term outcomes. To this end, we develop our flexible method, Laser, to estimate long-term causal effects in the more realistic situation that the surrogates are observed or have observed proxies.Given the indistinguishability between the surrogates and proxies, we utilize identifiable variational auto-encoder (iVAE) to recover the whole valid surrogates on all the surrogates candidates without the need of distinguishing the observed surrogates or the proxies of latent surrogates. With the help of the recovered surrogates, we further devise an unbiased estimation of long-term causal effects.

In the digital era, ABSA gained increasing popularity and applications in mining opinionated text data to obtain insights and support decisions. ABSA research employs linguistic, statistical, and machine-learning approaches and utilises resources such as labelled datasets, aspect and sentiment lexicons and ontology. By its nature, ABSA is domain-dependent and can be sensitive to the impact of misalignment between the resource and application domains. However, to our knowledge, this topic has not been explored by the existing ABSA literature reviews. In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of ABSA studies with a focus on the research application domain, dataset domain, and the research methods to examine their relationships and identify trends over time. Our results suggest a number of potential systemic issues in the ABSA research literature, including the predominance of the ``product/service review'' dataset domain among the majority of studies that did not have a specific research application domain, coupled with the prevalence of dataset-reliant methods such as supervised machine learning. This review makes a number of unique contributions to the ABSA research field: 1) To our knowledge, it is the first SLR that links the research domain, dataset domain, and research method through a systematic perspective; 2) it is one of the largest scoped SLR on ABSA, with 519 eligible studies filtered from 4191 search results without time constraint; and 3) our review methodology adopted an innovative automatic filtering process based on PDF-mining, which enhanced screening quality and reliability.

All checkpoints are collected to establish a deep learning sub-model pool, and weight adjustment and diversity strategies are developed during the combination process. The main advantage of this method is its ability to generate the required base learners through a single training process, utilizing the decaying strategy to tackle the challenge posed by the stochastic nature of gradient descent in determining the optimal learning rate. To ensure the method's generalizability and competitiveness, this paper conducts an empirical analysis using the weekly dataset from the M4 competition and explores sensitivity to the number of models to be combined.

While RASP is effective to handle domain shifts, its naive integration into the training procedure might degrade the capability of learning knowledge from source domains because it has no restriction on the perturbations of representations. This challenge is alleviated by Normalized Feature Mixup (NFM), which facilitates the learning of the original features while achieving robustness to perturbed representations via their mixup during training.

We design a commonsense validation pipeline that uses a large language model to critique the results from the scene graph prediction system and then use that feedback to enhance the model performance. The system requires no external large language model assistance at test time, making it more convenient for practical applications. Experiments on the Visual Genome and the OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that harnessing hierarchical relationships enhances the model performance by a large margin.

    "title": "Better with Less: A Data-Active Perspective on Pre-Training Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Pre-training on graph neural networks (GNNs) aims to learn transferable knowledge for downstream tasks with unlabeled data, and it has recently become an active research area. The success of graph pre-training models is often attributed to the massive amount of input data. In this paper, however, we identify the curse of big data phenomenon in graph pre-training: more training data do not necessarily lead to better downstream performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a better-with-less framework for graph pre-training: fewer, but carefully chosen data are fed into a GNN model to enhance pre-training. The proposed pre-training pipeline is called the data-active graph pre-training (APT) framework, and is composed of a graph selector and a pre-training model. The graph selector chooses the most representative and instructive data points based on the inherent properties of graphs as well as predictive uncertainty. The proposed predictive uncertainty, as feedback from the pre-training model, measures the confidence level of the model in the data. When fed with the chosen data, on the other hand, the pre-training model grasps an initial understanding of the new, unseen data, and at the same time attempts to remember the knowledge learned from previous data. Therefore, the integration and interaction between these two components form a unified framework (APT), in which graph pre-training is performed in a progressive and iterative way. Experiment results show that the proposed APT is able to obtain an efficient pre-training model with fewer training data and better downstream performance",

    "title": "Post-Training Quantization with Low-precision Minifloats and Integers on FPGAs",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a powerful technique for model compression, reducing the precision of neural networks without additional training overhead. Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads. Finally, we evaluate our results against an FPGA-based hardware cost model, showing that integer quantization often remains the Pareto-optimal option, given its relatively smaller hardware resource footprint",

    "title": "Federated Learning via Consensus Mechanism on Heterogeneous Data: A New Perspective on Convergence",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) on heterogeneous data (non-IID data) has recently received great attention. Most existing methods focus on studying the convergence guarantees for the global objective. While these methods can guarantee the decrease of the global objective in each communication round, they fail to ensure risk decrease for each client. In this paper, to address the problem,we propose FedCOME, which introduces a consensus mechanism to enforce decreased risk for each client after each training round. In particular, we allow a slight adjustment to a client's gradient on the server side, which generates an acute angle between the corrected gradient and the original ones of other clients. We theoretically show that the consensus mechanism can guarantee the convergence of the global objective. To generalize the consensus mechanism to the partial participation FL scenario, we devise a novel client sampling strategy to select the most representative clients for the global data distribution. Training on these selected clients with the consensus mechanism could empirically lead to risk decrease for clients that are not selected. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to show the superiority of FedCOME against other state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Despite their popularity across a wide range of domains, regression neural networks are prone to overfitting complex datasets. In this work, we propose a loss function termed Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, which is empirically shown to mitigate overfitting. With RLP loss, the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of the neural network's feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs is minimized. The intuition behind this loss derives from the notion that if two functions share the same hyperplanes connecting all subsets of feature-label pairs, then these functions must necessarily be equivalent. Our empirical studies, conducted across benchmark datasets and representative synthetic examples, demonstrate the improvements of the proposed RLP loss over mean squared error (MSE). Specifically, neural networks trained with the RLP loss achieve better performance while requiring fewer data samples and are more robust to additive noise. We provide theoretical analysis supporting our empirical findings",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Tour itinerary recommendation involves planning a sequence of relevant Point-of-Interest (POIs), which combines challenges from the fields of both Operations Research (OR) and Recommendation Systems (RS). As an OR problem, there is the need to maximize a certain utility (e.g., popularity of POIs in the tour) while adhering to some constraints (e.g., maximum time for the tour). As a RS problem, it is heavily related to problem or filtering or ranking a subset of POIs that are relevant to a user and recommending it as part of an itinerary. In this paper, we explore the use of language models for the task of tour itinerary recommendation and planning. This task has the unique requirement of recommending personalized POIs relevant to users and planning these POIs as an itinerary that satisfies various constraints. We discuss some approaches in this area, such as using word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe for learning POI embeddings and transformer-based techniques like BERT for generating itineraries",

    "abstract": "With the bomb ignited by ChatGPT, Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved a revolutionary path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and have been applied in diverse areas as knowledge bases, human interfaces, and dynamic agents. However, a prevailing limitation exists: many current LLMs, constrained by resources, are primarily pre-trained on shorter texts, rendering them less effective for longer-context prompts, commonly encountered in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey focusing on the advancement of model architecture in Transformer-based LLMs to optimize long-context capabilities across all stages from pre-training to inference. We firstly delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. Then, we mainly offer a holistic taxonomy to navigate the landscape of Transformer upgrades on architecture to solve these problems. Afterward, we provide the investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as some amazing optimization toolkits like libraries, systems, and compilers to augment LLMs' efficiency and efficacy across different stages. Finally, we further discuss the predominant challenges and potential avenues for future research in this domain.

However, these networks can be difficult or impossible to train accurately for some systems of equations. We present a novel multifidelity framework for stacking physics-informed neural networks and operator networks that facilitates training. We successively build a chain of networks, where the output at one step can act as a low-fidelity input for training the next step, gradually increasing the expressivity of the learned model. The equations imposed at each step of the iterative process can be the same or different (akin to simulated annealing). The iterative (stacking) nature of the proposed method allows us to progressively learn features of a solution that are hard to learn directly. Through benchmark problems including a nonlinear pendulum, the wave equation, and the viscous Burgers equation, we show how stacking can be used to improve the accuracy and reduce the required size of physics-informed neural networks and operator networks",

Synthetic data offers a promising solution, especially with recent advances in diffusion-based methods like stable diffusion (SD). However, the direct application of diffusion methods to aerial domains poses unique challenges: stable diffusion's optimization for rich ground-level semantics doesn't align with the sparse nature of aerial objects, and the extraction of post-synthesis object coordinates remains problematic. To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

The main symptom of epilepsy is seizures, which occur abruptly and can cause serious injury or death. The ability to predict the occurrence of an epileptic seizure could alleviate many risks and stresses people with epilepsy face. We formulate the problem of detecting preictal (or pre-seizure) with reference to normal EEG as a precursor to incoming seizure. To this end, we developed several supervised deep learning approaches model to identify preictal EEG from normal EEG. We further develop novel unsupervised deep learning approaches to train the models on only normal EEG, and detecting pre-seizure EEG as an anomalous event. These deep learning models were trained and evaluated on two large EEG seizure datasets in a person-specific manner. We found that both supervised and unsupervised approaches are feasible; however, their performance varies depending on the patient, approach and architecture.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is an essential paradigm for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies.

Although several GCN-based methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train if too many layers are created. However, since the linear GCN model can be interpreted as a differential equation, it is possible to transfer it to an ODE problem. This inspired us to address the computational limitations of GCN-based models by designing a simple and efficient NODE-based model that can skip some GCN layers to reach the final state, thus avoiding the need to create many layers. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation-based method for Collaborative Filtering (GODE-CF). This method estimates the final embedding by utilizing the information captured by one or two GCN layers. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines, including GCN-based models and other state-of-the-art CF methods. Notably, our proposed GODE-CF model has several advantages over traditional GCN-based models.

    "abstract": "Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab and Twitter",

When the amplitude encoding is used, loading an arbitrary classical vector requires up to exponential circuit depths with respect to the number of qubits. Here, we address this \"input problem\" with two contributions. First, we introduce a circuit compilation method based on tensor network (TN) theory. Our method -- AMLET (Automatic Multi-layer Loader Exploiting TNs) -- proceeds via careful construction of a specific TN topology and can be tailored to arbitrary circuit depths. Second, we perform numerical experiments on real-world classical data from four distinct areas: finance, images, fluid mechanics, and proteins. To the best of our knowledge, this is the broadest numerical analysis to date of loading classical data into a quantum computer. Consistent with other recent work in this area, the required circuit depths are often several orders of magnitude lower than the exponentially-scaling general loading algorithm would require. Besides introducing a more efficient loading algorithm, this work demonstrates that many classical datasets are loadable in depths that are much shorter than previously expected, which has positive implications for speeding up classical workloads on quantum computers",

To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (foretasted) probability distributions of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s). The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification",

We compare different methods for making such differentiations, from physics method, statistics method, to AI method. Our finding suggests that the AI method outperforms both the statistical method and the physics method in its sensitivity. Our result provides a proof-of-concept that AI can potentially detect macroscopic changes in many-body systems that elude physical measures",

However, contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms within this category primarily emphasize improvement in expected performance, lacking the ability to control over the worst-case performance outcomes. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel objective function; by optimizing which, it will lead to guaranteed monotonic improvement in the lower bound of near-total performance samples (absolute performance). Considering this groundbreaking theoretical advancement, we then refine this theoretically grounded algorithm through a series of approximations, resulting in a practical solution called Absolute Policy Optimization (APO). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across challenging continuous control benchmark tasks and extend its applicability to mastering Atari games. Our findings reveal that APO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithms, resulting in substantial improvements in both expected performance and worst-case performance",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing \"Brain Coral\" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are available on Github for the community to explore and build upon",

    "abstract": "Bounding privacy leakage over compositions, i.e., privacy accounting, is a key challenge in differential privacy (DP). The privacy parameter ($\\eps$ or $\\delta$) is often easy to estimate but hard to bound. In this paper, we propose a new differential privacy paradigm called estimate-verify-release (EVR), which addresses the challenges of providing a strict upper bound for privacy parameter in DP compositions by converting an estimate of privacy parameter into a formal guarantee. The EVR paradigm first estimates the privacy parameter of a mechanism, then verifies whether it meets this guarantee, and finally releases the query output based on the verification result. The core component of the EVR is privacy verification. We develop a randomized privacy verifier using Monte Carlo (MC) technique. Furthermore, we propose an MC-based DP accountant that outperforms existing DP accounting techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation shows the newly proposed EVR paradigm improves the utility-privacy tradeoff for privacy-preserving machine learning",

While researchers had attempted to extend this success to time series models, the main challenge is effectively extracting representations and transferring knowledge from pretraining datasets to the target finetuning dataset. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel pretraining procedure that leverages supervised contrastive learning to distinguish features within each pretraining dataset. This pretraining phase enables a probabilistic similarity metric, which assesses the likelihood of a univariate sample being closely related to one of the pretraining datasets. Subsequently, using this similarity metric as a guide, we propose a fine-tuning procedure designed to enhance the accurate prediction of the target data by aligning it more closely with the learned dynamics of the pretraining datasets.

We then resample a dataset with these domain weights and train a larger, full-sized model. In our experiments, we use DoReMi on a 280M-parameter proxy model to set the domain weights for training an 8B-parameter model (30x larger) more efficiently. On The Pile, DoReMi improves perplexity across all domains, even when it downweights a domain. DoReMi improves average few-shot downstream accuracy by 6.5% points over a baseline model trained using The Pile's default domain weights and reaches the baseline accuracy with 2.6x fewer training steps. On the GLaM dataset, DoReMi, which has no knowledge of downstream tasks, even matches the performance of using domain weights tuned on downstream tasks",

This method has applications in feature extraction, matrix column selection, and dictionary learning, and it is distinct from commonly used $\\ell_{2,1}$ regularization and other existing regularization-based approaches because it can exploit the full rank of the row-sparse solution matrix, a key feature in many applications.

Many studies have utilized machine learning or deep learning techniques to implement probabilistic forecasting reconciliation and have made notable progress. However, these methods treat the reconciliation step as a fixed and hard post-processing step, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and coherency. In this paper, we propose a new approach for probabilistic forecast reconciliation. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed approach fuses the prediction step and reconciliation step into a deep learning framework, making the reconciliation step more flexible and soft by introducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term into the loss function. The approach is evaluated using three hierarchical time series datasets, which shows the advantages of our approach over other probabilistic forecast reconciliation methods",

While existing works are able to prove full identifiability of the underlying data generating process, they typically assume access to single-node, hard interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice. The main contribution of this paper is characterize a notion of identifiability which is provably the best one can achieve when hard interventions are not available. First, for linear causal models, we provide identifiability guarantee for data observed from general environments without assuming any similarities between them. While the causal graph is shown to be fully recovered, the latent variables are only identified up to an effect-domination ambiguity (EDA). We then propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which is guaranteed to recover the ground-truth model up to EDA, and we demonstrate its effectiveness via numerical experiments. Moving on to general non-parametric causal models, we prove the same idenfifiability guarantee assuming access to groups of soft interventions. Finally, we provide counterparts of our identifiability results, indicating that EDA is basically inevitable in our setting",

    "abstract": "Improving system-level resiliency of networked microgrids is an important aspect with increased population of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This paper (1) presents resilient control design in presence of adversarial cyber-events, and proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning (Fed-RL) approach to tackle (a) model complexities, unknown dynamical behaviors of IBR devices, (b) privacy issues regarding data sharing in multi-party-owned networked grids, and (2) transfers learned controls from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop test-bed, thereby bridging the gap between simulation and real world. With these multi-prong objectives, first, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) training setup generating episodic trajectories with adversaries (attack signal) injected at the primary controllers of the grid forming (GFM) inverters where RL agents (or controllers) are being trained to mitigate the injected attacks. For networked microgrids, the horizontal Fed-RL method involving distinct independent environments is not appropriate, leading us to develop vertical variant Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FedSAC) algorithm to grasp the interconnected dynamics of networked microgrid. Next, utilizing OpenAI Gym interface, we built a custom simulation set-up in GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform, named Resilient RL Co-simulation (ResRLCoSIM), to train the RL agents with IEEE 123-bus benchmark test systems comprising 3 interconnected microgrids. Finally, the learned policies in simulation world are transferred to the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up developed using high-fidelity Hypersim platform. Experiments show that the simulator-trained RL controllers produce convincing results with the real-time test-bed set-up, validating the minimization of sim-to-real gap",

    "abstract": "Learning to solve tasks from a sparse reward signal is a major challenge for standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, in the real world, agents rarely need to solve sparse reward tasks entirely from scratch. More often, we might possess prior experience to draw on that provides considerable guidance about which actions and outcomes are possible in the world, which we can use to explore more effectively for new tasks. In this work, we study how prior data without reward labels may be used to guide and accelerate exploration for an agent solving a new sparse reward task. We propose a simple approach that learns a reward model from online experience, labels the unlabeled prior data with optimistic rewards, and then uses it concurrently alongside the online data for downstream policy and critic optimization. This general formula leads to rapid exploration in several challenging sparse-reward domains where tabula rasa exploration is insufficient, including the AntMaze domain, Adroit hand manipulation domain, and a visual simulated robotic manipulation domain.

Diverging from this trend, in this study, we analyze real-world human driving trajectories, extracting a wide range of acceleration behaviors during car-following. We then incorporate these behaviors in simulation where RVs from prior studies are employed to mitigate congestion, and evaluate their safety, efficiency, and stability. Further, we also introduce a reinforcement learning based RV that utilizes a congestion stage classifier neural network to optimize either \"safety+stability\" or \"efficiency\" in the presence of the diverse human driving behaviors.

While neural networks are widely used for machine learning tasks such as classification and regression, their application in solving optimization problems has been limited. Our study begins by determining the best activation function for approximating the objective functions of popular nonlinear optimization test problems, and the evidence provided shows that~SiLU has the best performance. We then analyze the accuracy of function value, gradient, and Hessian approximations for such objective functions obtained through interpolation/regression models and neural networks. When compared to interpolation/regression models, neural networks can deliver competitive zero- and first-order approximations (at a high training cost) but underperform on second-order approximation. However, it is shown that combining a neural net activation function with the natural basis for quadratic interpolation/regression can waive the necessity of including cross terms in the natural basis, leading to models with fewer parameters to determine. Lastly, we provide evidence that the performance of a state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization algorithm can hardly be improved when the gradient of an objective function is approximated using any of the surrogate models considered, including neural networks",

We propose imitation bootstrapped reinforcement learning (IBRL), a novel framework that first trains an IL policy on a limited number of demonstrations and then uses it to propose alternative actions for both online exploration and target value bootstrapping. IBRL achieves SoTA performance and sample efficiency on 7 challenging sparse reward continuous control tasks in simulation while learning directly from pixels. As a highlight of our method, IBRL achieves $6.4\\times$ higher success rate than RLPD, a strong method that combines the idea of oversampling demonstrations with modern RL improvements, under the budget of 10 demos and 100K interactions in the challenging PickPlaceCan task in the Robomimic benchmark",

Such disturbances are modeled as the \"unknown\" part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. First, we expand upon the notion of \"regularizability\" and characterize this system characteristic for a linear time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded higher-order terms. \"Rapid-regularizability\" then gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior. We then propose the Data-Guided Regulation for Adaptive Nonlinear Control ( DG-RAN) algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of adverse environmental disturbances",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We consider the non-convex non-concave objective function in two-player zero-sum continuous games. The existence of pure Nash equilibrium requires stringent conditions, posing a major challenge for this problem. To circumvent this difficulty, we examine the problem of identifying a mixed Nash equilibrium, where strategies are randomized and characterized by probability distributions over continuous domains.To this end, we propose PArticle-based Primal-dual ALgorithm (PAPAL) tailored for a weakly entropy-regularized min-max optimization over probability distributions. This algorithm employs the stochastic movements of particles to represent the updates of random strategies for the $\\epsilon$-mixed Nash equilibrium. We offer a comprehensive convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness. In contrast to prior research that attempted to update particle importance without movements, PAPAL is the first implementable particle-based algorithm accompanied by non-asymptotic quantitative convergence results, running time, and sample complexity guarantees. Our framework contributes novel insights into the particle-based algorithms for continuous min-max optimization in the general non-convex non-concave setting",

    "title": "Addressing caveats of neural persistence with deep graph persistence",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Neural Persistence is a prominent measure for quantifying neural network complexity, proposed in the emerging field of topological data analysis in deep learning. In this work, however, we find both theoretically and empirically that the variance of network weights and spatial concentration of large weights are the main factors that impact neural persistence. Whilst this captures useful information for linear classifiers, we find that no relevant spatial structure is present in later layers of deep neural networks, making neural persistence roughly equivalent to the variance of weights. Additionally, the proposed averaging procedure across layers for deep neural networks does not consider interaction between layers. Based on our analysis, we propose an extension of the filtration underlying neural persistence to the whole neural network instead of single layers, which is equivalent to calculating neural persistence on one particular matrix. This yields our deep graph persistence measure, which implicitly incorporates persistent paths through the network and alleviates variance-related issues through standardisation.

    "abstract": "Many metric learning tasks, such as triplet learning, nearest neighbor retrieval, and visualization, are treated primarily as embedding tasks where the ultimate metric is some variant of the Euclidean distance (e.g., cosine or Mahalanobis), and the algorithm must learn to embed points into the pre-chosen space. The study of non-Euclidean geometries is often not explored, which we believe is due to a lack of tools for learning non-Euclidean measures of distance. Recent work has shown that Bregman divergences can be learned from data, opening a promising approach to learning asymmetric distances. We propose a new approach to learning arbitrary Bergman divergences in a differentiable manner via input convex neural networks and show that it overcomes significant limitations of previous works. We also demonstrate that our method more faithfully learns divergences over a set of both new and previously studied tasks, including asymmetric regression, ranking, and clustering. Our tests further extend to known asymmetric, but non-Bregman tasks, where our method still performs competitively despite misspecification, showing the general utility of our approach for asymmetric learning",

Unlike the unrelated Winograd minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional layers, FIP is applicable to all machine learning (ML) model layers that can mainly decompose to matrix multiplication, including fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent, and attention/transformer layers. We implement FIP for the first time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget. Our FFIP implementation for non-sparse ML models with 8 to 16-bit fixed-point inputs achieves higher throughput and compute efficiency than the best-in-class prior solutions on the same type of compute platform",

We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favourable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate-sized datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series",

To address this, we (1) propose a way to augment graph neural networks (GNNs) with a stack, and (2) develop an approach for capturing intermediate algorithm trajectories that improves algorithmic alignment with recursive algorithms over previous methods. The stack allows the network to learn to store and recall a portion of the state of the network at a particular time, analogous to the action of a call stack in a recursive algorithm. This augmentation permits the network to reason recursively.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) research has highlighted a relationship between high homophily (i.e., the tendency of nodes of the same class to connect) and strong predictive performance in node classification. However, recent work has found the relationship to be more nuanced, demonstrating that simple GNNs can learn in certain heterophilous settings. To resolve these conflicting findings and align closer to real-world datasets, we go beyond the assumption of a global graph homophily level and study the performance of GNNs when the local homophily level of a node deviates from the global homophily level. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we systematically demonstrate how shifts in local homophily can introduce performance degradation, leading to performance discrepancies across local homophily levels. We ground the practical implications of this work through granular analysis on five real-world datasets with varying global homophily levels, demonstrating that (a) GNNs can fail to generalize to test nodes that deviate from the global homophily of a graph, and (b) high local homophily does not necessarily confer high performance for a node. We further show that GNNs designed for globally heterophilous graphs can alleviate performance discrepancy by improving performance across local homophily levels, offering a new perspective on how these GNNs achieve stronger global performance",

ACML harnesses the power of effective asymmetric contrastive learning to seamlessly transfer information from various chemical modalities to molecular graph representations. By combining pre-trained chemical unimodal encoders and a shallow-designed graph encoder, ACML facilitates the assimilation of coordinated chemical semantics from different modalities, leading to comprehensive representation learning with efficient training. This innovative framework enhances the interpretability of learned representations and bolsters the expressive power of graph neural networks.

To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy, dynamic sample dropout (DSD), which considers previous best label assignments and evaluation metrics to exclude the samples that may negatively impact the learned label assignments during training. Additionally, we include layer-wise optimization (LO) to improve the performance by solving layer-decoupling. Our experiments showed that combining DSD and LO outperforms the baseline and solves excessive label assignment switching and layer-decoupling issues.

However, storing historical data is cheap in many real-world settings, yet replaying all historical data is often prohibited due to processing time constraints. In such settings, we propose that continual learning systems should learn the time to learn and schedule which tasks to replay at different time steps. We first demonstrate the benefits of our proposal by using Monte Carlo tree search to find a proper replay schedule, and show that the found replay schedules can outperform fixed scheduling policies when combined with various replay methods in different continual learning settings. Additionally, we propose a framework for learning replay scheduling policies with reinforcement learning. We show that the learned policies can generalize better in new continual learning scenarios compared to equally replaying all seen tasks, without added computational cost. Our study reveals the importance of learning the time to learn in continual learning, which brings current research closer to real-world needs",

Specifically, we frame data contamination detection as a series of multiple-choice questions. We devise a quiz format wherein three perturbed versions of each dataset instance are created. These changes only include word-level perturbations, replacing words with their contextual synonyms, ensuring both the semantic and sentence structure remain exactly the same as the original instance. Together with the original instance, these perturbed versions constitute the choices in the quiz. Given that the only distinguishing signal among these choices is the exact wording, an LLM, when tasked with identifying the original instance from the choices, opts for the original if it has memorized it in its pre-training phase--a trait intrinsic to LLMs. A dataset partition is then marked as contaminated if the LLM's performance on the quiz surpasses what random chance suggests. Our evaluation spans seven datasets and their respective splits (train and test/validation) on two state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. While lacking access to the pre-training data, our results suggest that our approach not only enhances the detection of data contamination but also provides an accurate estimation of its extent, even when the contamination signal is weak",

Other methods that produce a distribution over node label assignment in trees (or more generally in graphs) either assume conditional independence of the label assignment, operate on a fixed graph topology, or require part of the node labels to be observed. Our method defines a Markov Network with the corresponding topology of the random tree and an associated Gibbs distribution. We parameterize the Gibbs distribution with a Graph Neural Network that operates on the random tree and the node embeddings. This allows us to estimate the likelihood of node assignments for a given random tree and use MCMC to sample from the distribution of node assignments.

Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success on a variety of tasks with graph-structural data, among which node classification is an essential one. Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) shows its practical value of reducing the labeling cost for node classification. It leverages knowledge from a labeled graph (i.e., source domain) to tackle the same task on another unlabeled graph (i.e., target domain). Most existing UGDA methods heavily rely on the labeled graph in the source domain. They utilize labels from the source domain as the supervision signal and are jointly trained on both the source graph and the target graph. However, in some real-world scenarios, the source graph is inaccessible because of privacy issues. Therefore, we propose a novel scenario named Source Free Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SFUGDA). In this scenario, the only information we can leverage from the source domain is the well-trained source model, without any exposure to the source graph and its labels. As a result, existing UGDA methods are not feasible anymore. To address the non-trivial adaptation challenges in this practical scenario, we propose a model-agnostic algorithm called SOGA for domain adaptation to fully exploit the discriminative ability of the source model while preserving the consistency of structural proximity on the target graph. We prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm both theoretically and empirically.

Most existing dynamic pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP) pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods",

Traditionally, this placed special emphasis on risk-based and robust formulations, and their focus on ``conservative\" decisions. We develop, in contrast, an ``optimistic\" framework based on Rockafellian relaxations in which optimization is conducted not only over the original decision space but also jointly with a choice of model perturbation. The framework enables us to address challenging problems with ambiguous probability distributions from the areas of two-stage stochastic optimization without relatively complete recourse, probability functions lacking continuity properties, expectation constraints, and outlier analysis. We are also able to circumvent the fundamental difficulty in stochastic optimization that convergence of distributions fails to guarantee convergence of expectations. The framework centers on the novel concepts of exact and limit-exact Rockafellians, with interpretations of ``negative'' regularization emerging in certain settings. We illustrate the role of Phi-divergence, examine rates of convergence under changing distributions, and explore extensions to first-order optimality conditions. The main development is free of assumptions about convexity, smoothness, and even continuity of objective functions. Numerical results in the setting of computer vision and text analytics with label noise illustrate the framework",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We introduce CartiMorph, a framework for automated knee articular cartilage morphometrics. It takes an image as input and generates quantitative metrics for cartilage subregions, including the percentage of full-thickness cartilage loss (FCL), mean thickness, surface area, and volume. CartiMorph leverages the power of deep learning models for hierarchical image feature representation. Deep learning models were trained and validated for tissue segmentation, template construction, and template-to-image registration. We established methods for surface-normal-based cartilage thickness mapping, FCL estimation, and rule-based cartilage parcellation. Our cartilage thickness map showed less error in thin and peripheral regions. We evaluated the effectiveness of the adopted segmentation model by comparing the quantitative metrics obtained from model segmentation and those from manual segmentation. The root-mean-squared deviation of the FCL measurements was less than 8%, and strong correlations were observed for the mean thickness (Pearson's correlation coefficient $\\rho \\in [0.82,0.97]$), surface area ($\\rho \\in [0.82,0.98]$) and volume ($\\rho \\in [0.89,0.98]$) measurements. We compared our FCL measurements with those from a previous study and found that our measurements deviated less from the ground truths. We observed superior performance of the proposed rule-based cartilage parcellation method compared with the atlas-based approach. CartiMorph has the potential to promote imaging biomarkers discovery for knee osteoarthritis",

    "title": "Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

    "title": "LQ-LoRA: Low-rank Plus Quantized Matrix Decomposition for Efficient Language Model Finetuning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on adapting RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and moreover enables more aggressive quantization. For example, on the OpenAssistant benchmark LQ-LoRA is able to learn a 2.5-bit LLaMA-2 model that is competitive with a model finetuned with 4-bit QLoRA. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) is competitive with the original model in full precision",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Pre-trained and frozen large language models (LLMs) can effectively map simple scene rearrangement instructions to programs over a robot's visuomotor functions through appropriate few-shot example prompting. To parse open-domain natural language and adapt to a user's idiosyncratic procedures, not known during prompt engineering time, fixed prompts fall short. In this paper, we introduce HELPER, an embodied agent equipped with an external memory of language-program pairs that parses free-form human-robot dialogue into action programs through retrieval-augmented LLM prompting: relevant memories are retrieved based on the current dialogue, instruction, correction, or VLM description, and used as in-context prompt examples for LLM querying. The memory is expanded during deployment to include pairs of user's language and action plans, to assist future inferences and personalize them to the user's language and routines. HELPER sets a new state-of-the-art in the TEACh benchmark in both Execution from Dialog History (EDH) and Trajectory from Dialogue (TfD), with a 1.7x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for TfD.

    "title": "Weak-Form Latent Space Dynamics Identification",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recent work in data-driven modeling has demonstrated that a weak formulation of model equations enhances the noise robustness of a wide range of computational methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of the weak form to enhance the LaSDI (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) algorithm, a recently developed data-driven reduced order modeling technique. We introduce a weak form-based version WLaSDI (Weak-form Latent Space Dynamics Identification). WLaSDI first compresses data, then projects onto the test functions and learns the local latent space models. Notably, WLaSDI demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise. With WLaSDI, the local latent space is obtained using weak-form equation learning techniques. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) used in LaSDI, the variance reduction of the weak form guarantees a robust and precise latent space recovery, hence allowing for a fast, robust, and accurate simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of WLaSDI vs. LaSDI on several common benchmark examples including viscid and inviscid Burgers', radial advection, and heat conduction. For instance, in the case of 1D inviscid Burgers' simulations with the addition of up to 100% Gaussian white noise, the relative error remains consistently below 6% for WLaSDI, while it can exceed 10,000% for LaSDI. Similarly, for radial advection simulations, the relative errors stay below 15% for WLaSDI, in stark contrast to the potential errors of up to 10,000% with LaSDI. Moreover, speedups of several orders of magnitude can be obtained with WLaSDI. For example applying WLaSDI to 1D Burgers' yields a 140X speedup compared to the corresponding full order model.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Designing a perfect reward function that depicts all the aspects of the intended behavior is almost impossible, especially generalizing it outside of the training environments. Active Inverse Reward Design (AIRD) proposed the use of a series of queries, comparing possible reward functions in a single training environment. This allows the human to give information to the agent about suboptimal behaviors, in order to compute a probability distribution over the intended reward function. However, it ignores the possibility of unknown features appearing in real-world environments, and the safety measures needed until the agent completely learns the reward function. I improved this method and created Risk-averse Batch Active Inverse Reward Design (RBAIRD), which constructs batches, sets of environments the agent encounters when being used in the real world, processes them sequentially, and, for a predetermined number of iterations, asks queries that the human needs to answer for each environment of the batch. After this process is completed in one batch, the probabilities have been improved and are transferred to the next batch. This makes it capable of adapting to real-world scenarios and learning how to treat unknown features it encounters for the first time. I also integrated a risk-averse planner, similar to that of Inverse Reward Design (IRD), which samples a set of reward functions from the probability distribution and computes a trajectory that takes the most certain rewards possible. This ensures safety while the agent is still learning the reward function, and enables the use of this approach in situations where cautiousness is vital. RBAIRD outperformed the previous approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and action certainty, demonstrated quick adaptability to new, unknown features, and can be more widely used for the alignment of crucial, powerful AI models",

The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance, inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources. The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their performance and inference times. The findings contribute to the development of lightweight techniques and establish benchmarks for future advances in lip segmentation, especially in IoT and edge computing scenarios",

Validation of lattice thermal conductivity is further carried out by comparing the ACE-predicted values to the DFT calculations and experiments, exhibiting the overall capability of our ACE potential in sufficiently describing anharmonic phonon interactions.

Facial expressions can be very useful for emotion recognition techniques, as these are the biggest transmitters of non-verbal cues capable of being correlated with emotions. Several techniques are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract information in a machine learning process. However, simple CNNs are not always sufficient to locate points of interest on the face that can be correlated with emotions. In this work, we intend to expand the capacity of emotion recognition techniques by proposing the usage of Facial Action Units (AUs) recognition techniques to recognize emotions. This recognition will be based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and computed by a machine learning system. In particular, our method expands over EmotiRAM, an approach for multi-cue emotion recognition, in which we improve over their facial encoding module",

Probabilistic classifiers with low-order probability tables, e.g. NB and AODE, are good alternatives for dealing with this type of data. AODE usually improves NB in accuracy, but suffers from high spatial complexity since $k$ models, each with $n+1$ variables, are included in the AODE ensemble. In this paper, we propose MiniAnDE, an algorithm that includes only a small number of heterogeneous base classifiers in the ensemble, i.e., each model only includes a different subset of the $k$ predictive variables. Experimental evaluation shows that using MiniAnDE classifiers on microarray data is feasible and outperforms NB and other ensembles such as bagging and random forest",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the rapid growth in wearable technologies and recent advancement in machine learning and signal processing, monitoring complex human contexts becomes feasible, paving the way to develop human-in-the-loop IoT systems that naturally evolve to adapt to the human and environment state autonomously. Nevertheless, a central challenge in designing many of these IoT systems arises from the requirement to infer the human mental state, such as intention, stress, cognition load, or learning ability. While different human contexts can be inferred from the fusion of different sensor modalities that can correlate to a particular mental state, the human brain provides a richer sensor modality that gives us more insights into the required human context. This paper proposes ERUDITE, a human-in-the-loop IoT system for the learning environment that exploits recent wearable neurotechnology to decode brain signals. Through insights from concept learning theory, ERUDITE can infer the human state of learning and understand when human learning increases or declines. By quantifying human learning as an input sensory signal, ERUDITE can provide adequate personalized feedback to humans in a learning environment to enhance their learning experience. ERUDITE is evaluated across $15$ participants and showed that by using the brain signals as a sensor modality to infer the human learning state and providing personalized adaptation to the learning environment, the participants' learning performance increased on average by $26\\%$. Furthermore, we showed that ERUDITE can be deployed on an edge-based prototype to evaluate its practicality and scalability",

Prior theoretical work studying risk-sensitive RL focuses on the tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) setting. To extend CVaR RL to settings where state space is large, function approximation must be deployed. We study CVaR RL in low-rank MDPs with nonlinear function approximation. Low-rank MDPs assume the underlying transition kernel admits a low-rank decomposition, but unlike prior linear models, low-rank MDPs do not assume the feature or state-action representation is known. We propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bonus-driven algorithm to carefully balance the interplay between exploration, exploitation, and representation learning in CVaR RL. We prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{H^7 A^2 d^4}{\\tau^2 \\epsilon^2}\\right)$ to yield an $\\epsilon$-optimal CVaR, where $H$ is the length of each episode, $A$ is the capacity of action space, and $d$ is the dimension of representations. Computational-wise, we design a novel discretized Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm for the CVaR objective as the planning oracle and show that we can find the near-optimal policy in a polynomial running time with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation oracle.

    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

These task embeddings are trained using an encoder-decoder architecture optimised for reconstruction of the transition and reward functions which uniquely identify tasks. We show that a team of agents is able to adapt to novel tasks when provided with task embeddings. We propose three MATE training paradigms: independent MATE, centralised MATE, and mixed MATE which vary in the information used for the task encoding. We show that the embeddings learned by MATE identify tasks and provide useful information which agents leverage during adaptation to novel tasks",

    "title": "NNG-Mix: Improving Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Pseudo-anomaly Generation",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data.

    "title": "Correlated Attention in Transformers for Multivariate Time Series",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) analysis prevails in real-world applications such as finance, climate science and healthcare. The various self-attention mechanisms, the backbone of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, efficiently discover the temporal dependencies, yet cannot well capture the intricate cross-correlation between different features of MTS data, which inherently stems from complex dynamical systems in practice. To this end, we propose a novel correlated attention mechanism, which not only efficiently captures feature-wise dependencies, but can also be seamlessly integrated within the encoder blocks of existing well-known Transformers to gain efficiency improvement. In particular, correlated attention operates across feature channels to compute cross-covariance matrices between queries and keys with different lag values, and selectively aggregate representations at the sub-series level. This architecture facilitates automated discovery and representation learning of not only instantaneous but also lagged cross-correlations, while inherently capturing time series auto-correlation. When combined with prevalent Transformer baselines, correlated attention mechanism constitutes a better alternative for encoder-only architectures, which are suitable for a wide range of tasks including imputation, anomaly detection and classification. Extensive experiments on the aforementioned tasks consistently underscore the advantages of correlated attention mechanism in enhancing base Transformer models, and demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in imputation, anomaly detection and classification",

    "title": "Meta-Path Learning for Multi-relational Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Existing multi-relational graph neural networks use one of two strategies for identifying informative relations: either they reduce this problem to low-level weight learning, or they rely on handcrafted chains of relational dependencies, called meta-paths. However, the former approach faces challenges in the presence of many relations (e.g., knowledge graphs), while the latter requires substantial domain expertise to identify relevant meta-paths. In this work we propose a novel approach to learn meta-paths and meta-path GNNs that are highly accurate based on a small number of informative meta-paths. Key element of our approach is a scoring function for measuring the potential informativeness of a relation in the incremental construction of the meta-path. Our experimental evaluation shows that the approach manages to correctly identify relevant meta-paths even with a large number of relations, and substantially outperforms existing multi-relational GNNs on synthetic and real-world experiments",

    "title": "Estimation of entropy-regularized optimal transport maps between non-compactly supported measures",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating entropy-regularized optimal transport (EOT) maps with squared-Euclidean cost between source and target measures that are subGaussian. In the case that the target measure is compactly supported or strongly log-concave, we show that for a recently proposed in-sample estimator, the expected squared $L^2$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/3})$ where $n$ is the sample size. For the general subGaussian case we show that the expected $L^1$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/6})$, and in both cases we have polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter. While these results are suboptimal compared to known results in the case of compactness of both the source and target measures (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1})$) and for when the source is subGaussian while the target is compactly supported (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1/2})$), their importance lie in eliminating the compact support requirements. The proof technique makes use of a bias-variance decomposition where the variance is controlled using standard concentration of measure results and the bias is handled by T1-transport inequalities along with sample complexity results in estimation of EOT cost under subGaussian assumptions. Our experimental results point to a looseness in controlling the variance terms and we conclude by posing several open problems",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and cancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data sets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been published. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer (e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features. However, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these features and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying important aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key features and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country. - Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and - The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only 2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are often NP-hard and thus out of reach for exact algorithms, making them a tempting domain to apply machine learning methods. The highly structured constraints in these problems can hinder either optimization or sampling directly in the solution space. On the other hand, GFlowNets have recently emerged as a powerful machinery to efficiently sample from composite unnormalized densities sequentially and have the potential to amortize such solution-searching processes in CO, as well as generate diverse solution candidates. In this paper, we design Markov decision processes (MDPs) for different combinatorial problems and propose to train conditional GFlowNets to sample from the solution space. Efficient training techniques are also developed to benefit long-range credit assignment. Through extensive experiments on a variety of different CO tasks with synthetic and realistic data, we demonstrate that GFlowNet policies can efficiently find high-quality solutions.

    "abstract": "Providing formal guarantees of algorithmic fairness is of paramount importance to socially responsible deployment of machine learning algorithms. In this work, we study formal guarantees, i.e., certificates, for individual fairness (IF) of neural networks. We start by introducing a novel convex approximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational cost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight that prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification and can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus limiting their practical impact. We propose to certify distributional individual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and all distributions within a $\\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has guaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in quasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on distributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to certify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude larger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world distribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound source of IF guarantees",

    "abstract": "Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) are crucial in modern air defense systems. A critical aspect of their effectiveness is the Engagement Zone (EZ), the spatial region within which a SAM can effectively engage and neutralize a target. Notably, the EZ is intrinsically related to the missile's maximum range; it defines the furthest distance at which a missile can intercept a target. The accurate computation of this EZ is essential but challenging due to the dynamic and complex factors involved, which often lead to high computational costs and extended processing times when using conventional simulation methods. In light of these challenges, our study investigates the potential of machine learning techniques, proposing an approach that integrates machine learning with a custom-designed simulation tool to train supervised algorithms. We leverage a comprehensive dataset of pre-computed SAM EZ simulations, enabling our model to accurately predict the SAM EZ for new input parameters. It accelerates SAM EZ simulations, enhances air defense strategic planning, and provides real-time insights, improving SAM system performance. The study also includes a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, illuminating their capabilities and performance metrics and suggesting areas for future research, highlighting the transformative potential of machine learning in SAM EZ simulations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The non-life insurance sector operates within a highly competitive and tightly regulated framework, confronting a pivotal juncture in the formulation of pricing strategies. Insurers are compelled to harness a range of statistical methodologies and available data to construct optimal pricing structures that align with the overarching corporate strategy while accommodating the dynamics of market competition. Given the fundamental societal role played by insurance, premium rates are subject to rigorous scrutiny by regulatory authorities. These rates must conform to principles of transparency, explainability, and ethical considerations. Consequently, the act of pricing transcends mere statistical calculations and carries the weight of strategic and societal factors. These multifaceted concerns may drive insurers to establish equitable premiums, taking into account various variables. For instance, regulations mandate the provision of equitable premiums, considering factors such as policyholder gender or mutualist group dynamics in accordance with respective corporate strategies. Age-based premium fairness is also mandated. In certain insurance domains, variables such as the presence of serious illnesses or disabilities are emerging as new dimensions for evaluating fairness. Regardless of the motivating factor prompting an insurer to adopt fairer pricing strategies for a specific variable, the insurer must possess the capability to define, measure, and ultimately mitigate any ethical biases inherent in its pricing practices while upholding standards of consistency and performance. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive set of tools for these endeavors and assess their effectiveness through practical application in the context of automobile insurance",

Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in previous literature on latent graph inference",

    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet.

    "abstract": "Eight percent of global carbon dioxide emissions can be attributed to the production of cement, the main component of concrete, which is also the dominant source of CO2 emissions in the construction of data centers. The discovery of lower-carbon concrete formulae is therefore of high significance for sustainability. However, experimenting with new concrete formulae is time consuming and labor intensive, as one usually has to wait to record the concrete's 28-day compressive strength, a quantity whose measurement can by its definition not be accelerated. This provides an opportunity for experimental design methodology like Bayesian Optimization (BO) to accelerate the search for strong and sustainable concrete formulae. Herein, we 1) propose modeling steps that make concrete strength amenable to be predicted accurately by a Gaussian process model with relatively few measurements, 2) formulate the search for sustainable concrete as a multi-objective optimization problem, and 3) leverage the proposed model to carry out multi-objective BO with real-world strength measurements of the algorithmically proposed mixes.

Nevertheless, training these models is bottlenecked by the large computational effort and memory footprint demanded by back-propagation. Recent work has presented alternatives for computing gradients of neural networks where a separate forward and backward sweep is not needed and storage of intermediate results between sweeps is not required because an unbiased estimator for the gradient is computed in a single forward sweep.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) algorithms strive to acquire new knowledge while preserving prior information. However, this stability-plasticity trade-off remains a central challenge. This paper introduces a framework that dissects this trade-off, offering valuable insights into CL algorithms. The Readout-Decomposition of Activation Change (RDAC) framework first addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma and its relation to catastrophic forgetting. It relates learning-induced activation changes in the range of prior readouts to the degree of stability and changes in the null space to the degree of plasticity. In deep non-linear networks tackling split-CIFAR-110 tasks, the framework clarifies the stability-plasticity trade-offs of the popular regularization algorithms Synaptic intelligence (SI), Elastic-weight consolidation (EWC), and learning without Forgetting (LwF), and replay-based algorithms Gradient episodic memory (GEM), and data replay. GEM and data replay preserved stability and plasticity, while SI, EWC, and LwF traded off plasticity for stability. The inability of the regularization algorithms to maintain plasticity was linked to them restricting the change of activations in the null space of the prior readout. Additionally, for one-hidden-layer linear neural networks, we derived a gradient decomposition algorithm to restrict activation change only in the range of the prior readouts, to maintain high stability while not further sacrificing plasticity. Results demonstrate that the algorithm maintained stability without significant plasticity loss. The RDAC framework informs the behavior of existing CL algorithms and paves the way for novel CL approaches. Finally, it sheds light on the connection between learning-induced activation/representation changes and the stability-plasticity dilemma, also offering insights into representational drift in biological systems",

DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was employed to explain the models' predictions. CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally. CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between different age groups",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive tailored, parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against perturbations in the input data. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly depends on the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings as frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. With numerical results, we demonstrate that, indeed, Lipschitz bound regularization leads to substantially more robust and generalizable quantum models",

    "title": "Establishing Central Sensitization Inventory Cut-off Values in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain by Unsupervised Machine Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Human Assumed Central Sensitization is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was developed to evaluate the presence of HACS, with a cut-off value of 40/100 based on patients with chronic pain. However, various factors including pain conditions (e.g., CLBP), and gender may influence this cut-off value. For chronic pain condition such as CLBP, unsupervised clustering approaches can take these factors into consideration and automatically learn the HACS-related patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the cut-off values for a Dutch-speaking population with CLBP, considering the total group and stratified by gender based on unsupervised machine learning. In this study, questionnaire data covering pain, physical, and psychological aspects were collected from patients with CLBP and aged-matched pain-free adults (referred to as healthy controls, HC). Four clustering approaches were applied to identify HACS-related clusters based on the questionnaire data and gender. The clustering performance was assessed using internal and external indicators. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted on the best clustering results to determine the optimal cut-off values. The study included 151 subjects, consisting of 63 HCs and 88 patients with CLBP. Hierarchical clustering yielded the best results, identifying three clusters: healthy group, CLBP with low HACS level, and CLBP with high HACS level groups. Based on the low HACS levels group (including HC and CLBP with low HACS level) and high HACS level group, the cut-off value for the overall groups were 35, 34 for females, and 35 for. The findings suggest that the optimal cut-off values for CLBP is 35. The gender-related cut-off values should be interpreted with caution due to the unbalanced gender distribution in the sample",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Benchmarks play an important role in the development of machine learning algorithms. For example, research in reinforcement learning (RL) has been heavily influenced by available environments and benchmarks. However, RL environments are traditionally run on the CPU, limiting their scalability with typical academic compute. Recent advancements in JAX have enabled the wider use of hardware acceleration to overcome these computational hurdles, enabling massively parallel RL training pipelines and environments. This is particularly useful for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research. First of all, multiple agents must be considered at each environment step, adding computational burden, and secondly, the sample complexity is increased due to non-stationarity, decentralised partial observability, or other MARL challenges. In this paper, we present JaxMARL, the first open-source code base that combines ease-of-use with GPU enabled efficiency, and supports a large number of commonly used MARL environments as well as popular baseline algorithms. When considering wall clock time, our experiments show that per-run our JAX-based training pipeline is up to 12500x faster than existing approaches. This enables efficient and thorough evaluations, with the potential to alleviate the evaluation crisis of the field. We also introduce and benchmark SMAX, a vectorised, simplified version of the popular StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, which removes the need to run the StarCraft II game engine. This not only enables GPU acceleration, but also provides a more flexible MARL environment, unlocking the potential for self-play, meta-learning, and other future applications in MARL.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Most of the existing federated multi-armed bandits (FMAB) designs are based on the presumption that clients will implement the specified design to collaborate with the server. In reality, however, it may not be possible to modify the clients' existing protocols. To address this challenge, this work focuses on clients who always maximize their individual cumulative rewards, and introduces a novel idea of ``reward teaching'', where the server guides the clients towards global optimality through implicit local reward adjustments. Under this framework, the server faces two tightly coupled tasks of bandit learning and target teaching, whose combination is non-trivial and challenging. A phased approach, called Teaching-After-Learning (TAL), is first designed to encourage and discourage clients' explorations separately. General performance analyses of TAL are established when the clients' strategies satisfy certain mild requirements. With novel technical approaches developed to analyze the warm-start behaviors of bandit algorithms, particularized guarantees of TAL with clients running UCB or epsilon-greedy strategies are then obtained. These results demonstrate that TAL achieves logarithmic regrets while only incurring logarithmic adjustment costs, which is order-optimal w.r.t. a natural lower bound. As a further extension, the Teaching-While-Learning (TWL) algorithm is developed with the idea of successive arm elimination to break the non-adaptive phase separation in TAL. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that when facing clients with UCB1, TWL outperforms TAL in terms of the dependencies on sub-optimality gaps thanks to its adaptive design. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed algorithms",

    "abstract": "We consider the stochastic gradient method with random reshuffling ($\\mathsf{RR}$) for tackling smooth nonconvex optimization problems. $\\mathsf{RR}$ finds broad applications in practice, notably in training neural networks. In this work, we first investigate the concentration property of $\\mathsf{RR}$'s sampling procedure and establish a new high probability sample complexity guarantee for driving the gradient (without expectation) below $\\varepsilon$, which effectively characterizes the efficiency of a single $\\mathsf{RR}$ execution. Our derived complexity matches the best existing in-expectation one up to a logarithmic term while imposing no additional assumptions nor changing $\\mathsf{RR}$'s updating rule. Furthermore, by leveraging our derived high probability descent property and bound on the stochastic error, we propose a simple and computable stopping criterion for $\\mathsf{RR}$ (denoted as $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$). This criterion is guaranteed to be triggered after a finite number of iterations, and then $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$ returns an iterate with its gradient below $\\varepsilon$ with high probability. Moreover, building on the proposed stopping criterion, we design a perturbed random reshuffling method ($\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$) that involves an additional randomized perturbation procedure near stationary points. We derive that $\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$ provably escapes strict saddle points and efficiently returns a second-order stationary point with high probability, without making any sub-Gaussian tail-type assumptions on the stochastic gradient errors.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

Unfortunately, the real-world observational data used to train and validate these models are almost always affected by biases that can strongly impact the outcomes validity: two examples are values missing not-at-random and selection bias. Addressing them is a key element in achieving transportability and in studying the causal relationships that are critical in clinical decision making, going beyond simpler statistical approaches based on probabilistic association. In this context, we propose a novel approach that combines selection diagrams, missingness graphs, causal discovery and prior knowledge into a single graphical model to estimate the cardiovascular risk of adolescent and young females who survived breast cancer. We learn this model from data comprising two different cohorts of patients. The resulting causal network model is validated by expert clinicians in terms of risk assessment, accuracy and explainability, and provides a prognostic model that outperforms competing machine learning methods",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several multispectral datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting the performance of segmentation algorithms",

Grohe (PODS 2020) proposed the theoretical foundations for using homomorphism counts in machine learning on graph level as well as node level tasks. By their very nature, these capture local structural information, which enables the creation of robust structural embeddings. While a first approach for graph level tasks has been made by Nguyen and Maehara (ICML 2020), we experimentally show the effectiveness of homomorphism count based node embeddings. Enriched with node labels, node weights, and edge weights, these offer an interpretable representation of graph data, allowing for enhanced explainability of machine learning models. We propose a theoretical framework for isomorphism-invariant homomorphism count based embeddings which lend themselves to a wide variety of downstream tasks. Our approach capitalises on the efficient computability of graph homomorphism counts for bounded treewidth graph classes, rendering it a practical solution for real-world applications. We demonstrate their expressivity through experiments on benchmark datasets. Although our results do not match the accuracy of state-of-the-art neural architectures, they are comparable to other advanced graph learning models. Remarkably, our approach demarcates itself by ensuring explainability for each individual feature. By integrating interpretable machine learning algorithms like SVMs or Random Forests, we establish a seamless, end-to-end explainable pipeline.

First, two complementary augmented views are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view.

By integrating diverse datasets, log representation methods and anomaly detectors, LogLead facilitates comprehensive benchmarking in log analysis research. We demonstrate that log loading from raw file to dataframe is over 10x faster with LogLead is compared to past solutions. We demonstrate roughly 2x improvement in Drain parsing speed by off-loading log message normalization to LogLead.

In this work, we build on the recent progress of operator learning and present a data-driven modeling framework that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the proposed model is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the spatial-temporal continuous learning framework with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data",

    "title": "Approximate Linear Programming and Decentralized Policy Improvement in Cooperative Multi-agent Markov Decision Processes",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a `cooperative' multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) involving m greater than 1 agents, where all agents are aware of the system model. At each decision epoch, all the m agents cooperatively select actions in order to maximize a common long-term objective. Since the number of actions grows exponentially in the number of agents, policy improvement is computationally expensive. Recent works have proposed using decentralized policy improvement in which each agent assumes that the decisions of the other agents are fixed and it improves its decisions unilaterally. Yet, in these works, exact values are computed. In our work, for cooperative multi-agent finite and infinite horizon discounted MDPs, we propose suitable approximate policy iteration algorithms, wherein we use approximate linear programming to compute the approximate value function and use decentralized policy improvement. Thus our algorithms can handle both large number of states as well as multiple agents. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithms and also demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on some numerical examples",

    "title": "Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

However, the absence of a systematical benchmark inhibits the development of designing effective, efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solutions. To address this challenge, in this paper, we first conduct a systematical and extensive comparison over existing prompt engineering methods, including question representation, example selection and example organization, and with these experimental results, we elaborate their pros and cons. Based on these findings, we propose a new integrated solution, named DAIL-SQL, which refreshes the Spider leaderboard with 86.6% execution accuracy and sets a new bar. To explore the potential of open-source LLM, we investigate them in various scenarios, and further enhance their performance with supervised fine-tuning. Our explorations highlight open-source LLMs' potential in Text-to-SQL, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of the supervised fine-tuning. Additionally, towards an efficient and economic LLM-based Text-to-SQL solution, we emphasize the token efficiency in prompt engineering and compare the prior studies under this metric.

    "abstract": "The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular deep latent variable model used to analyse high-dimensional datasets by learning a low-dimensional latent representation of the data. It simultaneously learns a generative model and an inference network to perform approximate posterior inference. Recently proposed extensions to VAEs that can handle temporal and longitudinal data have applications in healthcare, behavioural modelling, and predictive maintenance. However, these extensions do not account for heterogeneous data (i.e., data comprising of continuous and discrete attributes), which is common in many real-life applications. In this work, we propose the heterogeneous longitudinal VAE (HL-VAE) that extends the existing temporal and longitudinal VAEs to heterogeneous data. HL-VAE provides efficient inference for high-dimensional datasets and includes likelihood models for continuous, count, categorical, and ordinal data while accounting for missing observations.

This paper presents the Hybrid Early-fusion Attention Learning Network (HEALNet): a flexible multi-modal fusion architecture, which a) preserves modality-specific structural information, b) captures the cross-modal interactions and structural information in a shared latent space, c) can effectively handle missing modalities during training and inference, and d) enables intuitive model inspection by learning on the raw data input instead of opaque embeddings. We conduct multi-modal survival analysis on Whole Slide Images and Multi-omic data on four cancer cohorts of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

We provide new insights into this analysis and generalize it to nonlinear prediction tasks in latent dynamical systems, extending theoretical guarantees to the case where the map connecting latent variables and observations is known up to a linear transform. In addition, we propose algorithms based on random features and representation learning for the case when this map is unknown.

    "abstract": "Communication by rare, binary spikes is a key factor for the energy efficiency of biological brains. However, it is harder to train biologically-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) than artificial neural networks (ANNs). This is puzzling given that theoretical results provide exact mapping algorithms from ANNs to SNNs with time-to-first-spike (TTFS) coding. In this paper we analyze in theory and simulation the learning dynamics of TTFS-networks and identify a specific instance of the vanishing-or-exploding gradient problem. While two choices of SNN mappings solve this problem at initialization, only the one with a constant slope of the neuron membrane potential at threshold guarantees the equivalence of the training trajectory between SNNs and ANNs with rectified linear units. We demonstrate that training deep SNN models achieves the exact same performance as that of ANNs, surpassing previous SNNs on image classification datasets such as MNIST/Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10/CIFAR100 and PLACES365. Our SNN accomplishes high-performance classification with less than 0.3 spikes per neuron, lending itself for an energy-efficient implementation.

    "abstract": "Recent studies attempted to utilize multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to solve semi-supervised node classification on graphs, by training a student MLP by knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher graph neural network (GNN). While previous studies have focused mostly on training the student MLP by matching the output probability distributions between the teacher and student models during KD, it has not been systematically studied how to inject the structural information in an explicit and interpretable manner. Inspired by GNNs that separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\\Pi$, we re-frame the KD process as enabling the student MLP to explicitly learn both $T$ and $\\Pi$. Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$ before distillation from the teacher GNN, it still comes with a high computational cost from large matrix multiplications during training. To solve this problem, we propose Propagate & Distill (P&D), which propagates the output of the teacher GNN before KD and can be interpreted as an approximate process of the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Overlapping asymmetric datasets are common in data science and pose questions of how they can be incorporated together into a predictive analysis. In healthcare datasets there is often a small amount of information that is available for a larger number of patients such as an electronic health record, however a small number of patients may have had extensive further testing. Common solutions such as missing imputation can often be unwise if the smaller cohort is significantly different in scale to the larger sample, therefore the aim of this research is to develop a new method which can model the smaller cohort against a particular response, whilst considering the larger cohort also. Motivated by non-parametric models, and specifically flexible smoothing techniques via generalized additive models, we model a twice penalized P-Spline approximation method to firstly prevent over/under-fitting of the smaller cohort and secondly to consider the larger cohort. This second penalty is created through discrepancies in the marginal value of covariates that exist in both the smaller and larger cohorts. Through data simulations, parameter tunings and model adaptations to consider a continuous and binary response, we find our twice penalized approach offers an enhanced fit over a linear B-Spline and once penalized P-Spline approximation. Applying to a real-life dataset relating to a person's risk of developing Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis, we see an improved model fit performance of over 65%. Areas for future work within this space include adapting our method to not require dimensionality reduction and also consider parametric modelling methods. However, to our knowledge this is the first work to propose additional marginal penalties in a flexible regression of which we can report a vastly improved model fit that is able to consider asymmetric datasets, without the need for missing data imputation",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal of the self-information contained in this claim. A probability of occurrence of the claim is obtained from a language model and this probability is used to compute the self-information. Grounded in information theory, this approach is based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising the information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or character is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using average word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2). Interestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The performance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc tests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results. I.e., the GPT2 probability model outperforms models based on word and character frequencies, which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts. Still, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the word count",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. In this study, we introduce a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thus facilitating the simulation of diverse spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications",

    "abstract": "Vision transformers have gained significant attention and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, instance segmentation, and object detection. However, challenges remain in addressing attention complexity and effectively capturing fine-grained information within images. Existing solutions often resort to down-sampling operations, such as pooling, to reduce computational cost. Unfortunately, such operations are non-invertible and can result in information loss. In this paper, we present a novel approach called Scattering Vision Transformer (SVT) to tackle these challenges. SVT incorporates a spectrally scattering network that enables the capture of intricate image details. SVT overcomes the invertibility issue associated with down-sampling operations by separating low-frequency and high-frequency components. Furthermore, SVT introduces a unique spectral gating network utilizing Einstein multiplication for token and channel mixing, effectively reducing complexity. We show that SVT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with a significant reduction in a number of parameters and FLOPS. SVT shows 2\\% improvement over LiTv2 and iFormer. SVT-H-S reaches 84.2\\% top-1 accuracy, while SVT-H-B reaches 85.2\\% (state-of-art for base versions) and SVT-H-L reaches 85.7\\% (again state-of-art for large versions). SVT also shows comparable results in other vision tasks such as instance segmentation. SVT also outperforms other transformers in transfer learning on standard datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Oxford Flower, and Stanford Car datasets.

In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the dependence of model score estimation bias on both uncertainty and score itself. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection in terms of both model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression.

    "title": "SALSA-CLRS: A Sparse and Scalable Benchmark for Algorithmic Reasoning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We introduce an extension to the CLRS algorithmic learning benchmark, prioritizing scalability and the utilization of sparse representations. Many algorithms in CLRS require global memory or information exchange, mirrored in its execution model, which constructs fully connected (not sparse) graphs based on the underlying problem. Despite CLRS's aim of assessing how effectively learned algorithms can generalize to larger instances, the existing execution model becomes a significant constraint due to its demanding memory requirements and runtime (hard to scale). However, many important algorithms do not demand a fully connected graph; these algorithms, primarily distributed in nature, align closely with the message-passing paradigm employed by Graph Neural Networks. Hence, we propose SALSA-CLRS, an extension of the current CLRS benchmark specifically with scalability and sparseness in mind. Our approach includes adapted algorithms from the original CLRS benchmark and introduces new problems from distributed and randomized algorithms. Moreover, we perform a thorough empirical evaluation of our benchmark. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/jkminder/SALSA-CLRS",

    "title": "Adversarial Examples Are Not Real Features",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The existence of adversarial examples has been a mystery for years and attracted much interest. A well-known theory by \\citet{ilyas2019adversarial} explains adversarial vulnerability from a data perspective by showing that one can extract non-robust features from adversarial examples and these features alone are useful for classification. However, the explanation remains quite counter-intuitive since non-robust features are mostly noise features to humans. In this paper, we re-examine the theory from a larger context by incorporating multiple learning paradigms. Notably, we find that contrary to their good usefulness under supervised learning, non-robust features attain poor usefulness when transferred to other self-supervised learning paradigms, such as contrastive learning, masked image modeling, and diffusion models. It reveals that non-robust features are not really as useful as robust or natural features that enjoy good transferability between these paradigms. Meanwhile, for robustness, we also show that naturally trained encoders from robust features are largely non-robust under AutoAttack. Our cross-paradigm examination suggests that the non-robust features are not really useful but more like paradigm-wise shortcuts, and robust features alone might be insufficient to attain reliable model robustness.

    "title": "Can we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models' weights? Towards more secure Deep Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a key property to protect data and models from integrity attacks. In the Deep Learning (DL) field, it is commonly implemented through the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). However, when a model is shared or released, there is no way to check whether it is differentially private, that is, it required to trust the model provider. This situation poses a problem when data privacy is mandatory, specially with current data regulations, as the presence of DP can not be certificated consistently by any third party. Thus, we face the challenge of determining whether a DL model has been trained with DP, according to the title question: Can we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models' weights? Since the DP-SGD significantly changes the training process of a DL model, we hypothesize that DP leaves an imprint in the weights of a DL model, which can be used to predict whether a model has been trained with DP regardless of its architecture and the training dataset. In this paper, we propose to employ the imprint in model weights of using DP to infer the presence of DP training in a DL model. To substantiate our hypothesis, we developed an experimental methodology based on two datasets of weights of DL models, each with models with and without DP training and a meta-classifier to infer whether DP was used in the training process of a DL model, by accessing its weights. We accomplish both, the removal of the requirement of a trusted model provider and a strong foundation for this interesting line of research. Thus, our contribution is an additional layer of security on top of the strict private requirements of DP training in DL models, towards to DL models",

    "title": "Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time",

    "title": "Knowledge Augmented Machine Learning with Applications in Autonomous Driving: A Survey",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The availability of representative datasets is an essential prerequisite for many successful artificial intelligence and machine learning models. However, in real life applications these models often encounter scenarios that are inadequately represented in the data used for training. There are various reasons for the absence of sufficient data, ranging from time and cost constraints to ethical considerations. As a consequence, the reliable usage of these models, especially in safety-critical applications, is still a tremendous challenge. Leveraging additional, already existing sources of knowledge is key to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven approaches. Knowledge augmented machine learning approaches offer the possibility of compensating for deficiencies, errors, or ambiguities in the data, thus increasing the generalization capability of the applied models. Even more, predictions that conform with knowledge are crucial for making trustworthy and safe decisions even in underrepresented scenarios. This work provides an overview of existing techniques and methods in the literature that combine data-driven models with existing knowledge. The identified approaches are structured according to the categories knowledge integration, extraction and conformity. In particular, we address the application of the presented methods in the field of autonomous driving",

    "title": "Unveiling the Power of Self-Attention for Shipping Cost Prediction: The Rate Card Transformer",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Amazon ships billions of packages to its customers annually within the United States. Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0) to estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0 profitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies and delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost estimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or fixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high, or promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for estimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require extensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel architecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to encode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier information and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT has the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a shipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For example, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results demonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82% less error compared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08%. We also illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card that can improve the performance of tree-based models",

We apply a linear approximation to activation patching to estimate the importance of each edge in the computational subgraph.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) and linear System Identification (SI) have been historically developed independently. In this paper, we leverage well-established ML tools - especially the automatic differentiation framework - to introduce SIMBa, a family of discrete linear multi-step-ahead state-space SI methods using backpropagation. SIMBa relies on a novel Linear-Matrix-Inequality-based free parametrization of Schur matrices to ensure the stability of the identified model. We show how SIMBa generally outperforms traditional linear state-space SI methods, and sometimes significantly, although at the price of a higher computational burden. This performance gap is particularly remarkable compared to other SI methods with stability guarantees, where the gain is frequently above 25% in our investigations, hinting at SIMBa's ability to simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art fitting performance and enforce stability. Interestingly, these observations hold for a wide variety of input-output systems and on both simulated and real-world data, showcasing the flexibility of the proposed approach. We postulate that this new SI paradigm presents a great extension potential to identify structured nonlinear models from data, and we hence open-source SIMBa on https://github.com/Cemempamoi/simba",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the simplest deep learning optimizer with which to train deep neural networks. While SGD can use various learning rates, such as constant or diminishing rates, the previous numerical results showed that SGD performs better than other deep learning optimizers using when it uses learning rates given by line search methods. In this paper, we perform a convergence analysis on SGD with a learning rate given by an Armijo line search for nonconvex optimization. The analysis indicates that the upper bound of the expectation of the squared norm of the full gradient becomes small when the number of steps and the batch size are large. Next, we show that, for SGD with the Armijo-line-search learning rate, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization is a monotone decreasing convex function of the batch size; that is, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization decreases as the batch size increases. Furthermore, we show that the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic gradient computation cost, is a convex function of the batch size; that is, there exists a critical batch size that minimizes the SFO complexity. Finally, we provide numerical results that support our theoretical results. The numerical results indicate that the number of steps needed for training deep neural networks decreases as the batch size increases and that there exist the critical batch sizes that can be estimated from the theoretical results",

In this work, we propose a novel vision transformer based tiny beamformer (Tiny-VBF), which works on the raw radio-frequency channel data acquired through single-angle plane wave insonification. The output of our Tiny-VBF provides fast envelope detection requiring very low frame rate, i.e. 0.34 GOPs/Frame for a frame size of 368 x 128 in comparison to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. It also exhibited an 8% increase in contrast and gains of 5% and 33% in axial and lateral resolution respectively when compared to Tiny-CNN on in-vitro dataset. Additionally, our model showed a 4.2% increase in contrast and gains of 4% and 20% in axial and lateral resolution respectively when compared against conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer.

This approach however has limitations partly due to the pseudo-healthy reconstructions being imperfect and to the lack of natural thresholding mechanism.

State-of-the art neural-network architectures are then used to learn the controller tuning rule that maps input-output data onto the controller parameters, based on artificially generated data from perturbed versions of the digital twin. In this way, as far as we are aware, we tackle for the first time the problem of re-calibrating the controller by meta-learning the tuning rule directly from data, thus practically replacing the control engineer with a machine learning model.

We use glaucoma diagnosis based on color fundus images as an example to show the possibility of performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations. Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks. Memory limitations and low processing capabilities of embedded accelerated systems (EAS) limit their use for deep network-based system training. However, including specific acceleration hardware, such as NVIDIA's Maxwell GPU or Google's Edge TPU, enables them to perform inferences using complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times. In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms using Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Regarding energy usage, in approximate terms, for OD segmentation Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 38 and 190 mJ per image, respectively.

Ideally, these classifiers encode the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The challenge of collision-free navigation (CFN) for self-driving cars is an NP-hard problem addressed through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Despite the effectiveness of DRL methods, their application demands significant computing resources and prolonged training periods to establish a resilient agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning algorithms have recently demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple, non-real-world environments. However, their application in the real-world CFN domain has not been explored, and their direct adaptation would require a quantum computing device onboard the vehicle for testing. In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation for improving the training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware. Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator, a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our empirical evaluations showcase that Nav-Q surpasses its classical counterpart not only in terms of training stability but also, in certain instances, with respect to the convergence rate when analyzing the Reward vs. Episode curve. This enhancement is accomplished without negatively impacting the learned policy by the agent. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a model possessing greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines. Finally, we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation, observing that the quantum noise enhances the exploratory tendencies of the agent during training",

Such data can take numerous forms, for instance points, direction vectors, translations, or rotations, but to date there is no single architecture that can be applied to such a wide variety of geometric types while respecting their symmetries. In this paper we introduce the Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr), a general-purpose architecture for geometric data. GATr represents inputs, outputs, and hidden states in the projective geometric (or Clifford) algebra, which offers an efficient 16-dimensional vector-space representation of common geometric objects as well as operators acting on them. GATr is equivariant with respect to E(3), the symmetry group of 3D Euclidean space. As a Transformer, GATr is versatile, efficient, and scalable. We demonstrate GATr in problems from n-body modeling to wall-shear-stress estimation on large arterial meshes to robotic motion planning. GATr consistently outperforms both non-geometric and equivariant baselines in terms of error, data efficiency, and scalability",

Accelerating a few compute-intensive operations using the expert-tuned implementation of primitives does not fully exploit the performance potential of AI hardware. Various efforts have been made to compile a full deep neural network (DNN) graph. One of the biggest challenges is to achieve high-performance tensor compilation by generating expert level performance code for the dense compute-intensive operations and applying compilation optimization at the scope of DNN computation graph across multiple compute-intensive operations. We present oneDNN Graph Compiler, a tensor compiler that employs a hybrid approach of using techniques from both compiler optimization and expert-tuned kernels for high performance code generation of the deep neural network graph. oneDNN Graph Compiler addresses unique optimization challenges in the deep learning domain, such as low-precision computation, aggressive fusion of graph operations, optimization for static tensor shapes and memory layout, constant weight optimization, and memory buffer reuse.

This technology has vast applications in biotechnology and biomedicine but faces significant computational bottlenecks. Current methodologies often require multiple hours or even days to process extensive datasets, particularly in the domain of spectral clustering. To tackle these inefficiencies, we introduce SpecHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework supplemented by an FPGA-accelerated architecture with integrated near-storage preprocessing. Utilizing streamlined binary operations in an HDC environment, SpecHD capitalizes on the low-latency and parallel capabilities of FPGAs. This approach markedly improves clustering speed and efficiency, serving as a catalyst for real-time, high-throughput data analysis in future healthcare applications. Our evaluations demonstrate that SpecHD not only maintains but often surpasses existing clustering quality metrics while drastically cutting computational time. Specifically, it can cluster a large-scale human proteome dataset-comprising 25 million MS/MS spectra and 131 GB of MS data-in just 5 minutes. With energy efficiency exceeding 31x and a speedup factor that spans a range of 6x to 54x over existing state of-the-art solutions, SpecHD emerges as a promising solution for the rapid analysis of mass spectrometry data with great implications for personalized healthcare",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial noise. Adversarial Training (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy to protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to learning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial robustness. To address this issue, we highlight two criteria of robust representation: (1) Exclusion: \\emph{the feature of examples keeps away from that of other classes}; (2) Alignment: \\emph{the feature of natural and corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other}. These motivate us to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the asymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an asymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away examples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to weight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention, to obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly advance the robustness of AT and achieve state-of-the-art performance",

Recently, unsupervised controllable generative diffusion models have been applied to MRI undersampling reconstruction, without paired data or model retraining for different MRI acquisitions. However, diffusion models are generally slow in sampling and state-of-the-art acceleration techniques can lead to sub-optimal results when directly applied to the controllable generation process. This study introduces a new algorithm called Predictor-Projector-Noisor (PPN), which enhances and accelerates controllable generation of diffusion models for MRI undersampling reconstruction. Our results demonstrate that PPN produces high-fidelity MR images that conform to undersampled k-space measurements with significantly shorter reconstruction time than other controllable sampling methods.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations.

    "abstract": "Existing graph contrastive learning (GCL) techniques typically require two forward passes for a single instance to construct the contrastive loss, which is effective for capturing the low-frequency signals of node features. Such a dual-pass design has shown empirical success on homophilic graphs, but its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs, where directly connected nodes typically have different labels, is unknown. In addition, existing GCL approaches fail to provide strong performance guarantees. Coupled with the unpredictability of GCL approaches on heterophilic graphs, their applicability in real-world contexts is limited. Then, a natural question arises: Can we design a GCL method that works for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs with a performance guarantee? To answer this question, we theoretically study the concentration property of features obtained by neighborhood aggregation on homophilic and heterophilic graphs, introduce the single-pass augmentation-free graph contrastive learning loss based on the property, and provide performance guarantees for the minimizer of the loss on downstream tasks. As a direct consequence of our analysis, we implement the Single-Pass Graph Contrastive Learning method (SP-GCL). Empirically, on 14 benchmark datasets with varying degrees of homophily, the features learned by the SP-GCL can match or outperform existing strong baselines with significantly less computational overhead, which demonstrates the usefulness of our findings in real-world cases",

    "abstract": "Recently, Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have shown promising results in solving routing problems. However, most DRL solvers are commonly proposed to solve node routing problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Meanwhile, there has been limited research on applying neural methods to arc routing problems, such as the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP), since they often feature irregular and complex solution spaces compared to TSP. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a novel DRL framework to address the CPP with load-dependent costs (CPP-LC) (Corberan et al., 2018), which is a complex arc routing problem with load constraints. The novelty of our method is two-fold. First, we formulate the CPP-LC as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) sequential model. Subsequently, we introduce an autoregressive model based on DRL, namely Arc-DRL, consisting of an encoder and decoder to address the CPP-LC challenge effectively. Such a framework allows the DRL model to work efficiently and scalably to arc routing problems. Furthermore, we propose a new bio-inspired meta-heuristic solution based on Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) for CPP-LC. Extensive experiments show that Arc-DRL outperforms existing meta-heuristic methods such as Iterative Local Search (ILS) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) proposed by (Corberan et al., 2018) on large benchmark datasets for CPP-LC regarding both solution quality and running time; while the EA gives the best solution quality with much more running time.

Most existing imitation learning methods that do not require interacting with environments either model the expert distribution as the conditional probability p(a|s) (e.g., behavioral cloning, BC) or the joint probability p(s, a). Despite its simplicity, modeling the conditional probability with BC usually struggles with generalization. While modeling the joint probability can lead to improved generalization performance, the inference procedure is often time-consuming and the model can suffer from manifold overfitting. This work proposes an imitation learning framework that benefits from modeling both the conditional and joint probability of the expert distribution. Our proposed diffusion model-augmented behavioral cloning (DBC) employs a diffusion model trained to model expert behaviors and learns a policy to optimize both the BC loss (conditional) and our proposed diffusion model loss (joint). DBC outperforms baselines in various continuous control tasks in navigation, robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. We design additional experiments to verify the limitations of modeling either the conditional probability or the joint probability of the expert distribution as well as compare different generative models.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Weak supervision enables efficient development of training sets by reducing the need for ground truth labels. However, the techniques that make weak supervision attractive -- such as integrating any source of signal to estimate unknown labels -- also entail the danger that the produced pseudolabels are highly biased. Surprisingly, given everyday use and the potential for increased bias, weak supervision has not been studied from the point of view of fairness. We begin such a study, starting with the observation that even when a fair model can be built from a dataset with access to ground-truth labels, the corresponding dataset labeled via weak supervision can be arbitrarily unfair. To address this, we propose and empirically validate a model for source unfairness in weak supervision, then introduce a simple counterfactual fairness-based technique that can mitigate these biases. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for our approach to simultaneously improve both accuracy and fairness -- in contrast to standard fairness approaches that suffer from tradeoffs. Empirically, we show that our technique improves accuracy on weak supervision baselines by as much as 32\\% while reducing demographic parity gap by 82.5\\%. A simple extension of our method aimed at maximizing performance produces state-of-the-art performance in five out of ten datasets in the WRENCH benchmark",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Optimizers are essential components for successfully training deep neural network models. In order to achieve the best performance from such models, designers need to carefully choose the optimizer hyperparameters. However, this can be a computationally expensive and time-consuming process. Although it is known that all optimizer hyperparameters must be tuned for maximum performance, there is still a lack of clarity regarding the individual influence of minor priority hyperparameters, including the safeguard factor $\\epsilon$ and momentum factor $\\beta$, in leading adaptive optimizers (specifically, those based on the Adam optimizers). In this manuscript, we introduce a new framework based on gradient histograms to analyze and justify important attributes of adaptive optimizers, such as their optimal performance and the relationships and dependencies among hyperparameters. Furthermore, we propose a novel gradient histogram-based algorithm that automatically estimates a reduced and accurate search space for the safeguard hyperparameter $\\epsilon$, where the optimal value can be easily found",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Text-to-Speech (TTS) has recently seen great progress in synthesizing high-quality speech owing to the rapid development of parallel TTS systems, but producing speech with naturalistic prosodic variations, speaking styles and emotional tones remains challenging. Moreover, since duration and speech are generated separately, parallel TTS models still have problems finding the best monotonic alignments that are crucial for naturalistic speech synthesis. Here, we propose StyleTTS, a style-based generative model for parallel TTS that can synthesize diverse speech with natural prosody from a reference speech utterance. With novel Transferable Monotonic Aligner (TMA) and duration-invariant data augmentation schemes, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on both single and multi-speaker datasets in subjective tests of speech naturalness and speaker similarity. Through self-supervised learning of the speaking styles, our model can synthesize speech with the same prosodic and emotional tone as any given reference speech without the need for explicitly labeling these categories",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present StyleTTS 2, a text-to-speech (TTS) model that leverages style diffusion and adversarial training with large speech language models (SLMs) to achieve human-level TTS synthesis. StyleTTS 2 differs from its predecessor by modeling styles as a latent random variable through diffusion models to generate the most suitable style for the text without requiring reference speech, achieving efficient latent diffusion while benefiting from the diverse speech synthesis offered by diffusion models. Furthermore, we employ large pre-trained SLMs, such as WavLM, as discriminators with our novel differentiable duration modeling for end-to-end training, resulting in improved speech naturalness. StyleTTS 2 surpasses human recordings on the single-speaker LJSpeech dataset and matches it on the multispeaker VCTK dataset as judged by native English speakers. Moreover, when trained on the LibriTTS dataset, our model outperforms previous publicly available models for zero-shot speaker adaptation. This work achieves the first human-level TTS on both single and multispeaker datasets, showcasing the potential of style diffusion and adversarial training with large SLMs. The audio demos and source code are available at https://styletts2.github.io/",

    "abstract": "In recent days, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have become an emerging transformation in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and so on. Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor prediction. It can assist radiologists in their diagnosis and treatment planning. The proposed system achieved a high accuracy of 95.5% in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods",

For services that are deployed around the world, this poses a significant challenge for multilingual NLP: spelling errors need to be caught and corrected in all languages, and even in queries that use multiple languages. In this paper, we tackle this challenge using multi-teacher distillation. On our approach, a monolingual teacher model is trained for each language/locale, and these individual models are distilled into a single multilingual student model intended to serve all languages/locales. In experiments using open-source data as well as user data from a worldwide search service, we show that this leads to highly effective spelling correction models that can meet the tight latency requirements of deployed services",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for optimizing black-box functions with limited function evaluations. Recent works have shown that optimization in a latent space through deep generative models such as variational autoencoders leads to effective and efficient Bayesian optimization for structured or discrete data. However, as the optimization does not take place in the input space, it leads to an inherent gap that results in potentially suboptimal solutions. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose Correlated latent space Bayesian Optimization (CoBO), which focuses on learning correlated latent spaces characterized by a strong correlation between the distances in the latent space and the distances within the objective function. Specifically, our method introduces Lipschitz regularization, loss weighting, and trust region recoordination to minimize the inherent gap around the promising areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several optimization tasks in discrete data, such as molecule design and arithmetic expression fitting, and achieve high performance within a small budget",

    "abstract": "Robust reinforcement learning (RRL) aims at seeking a robust policy to optimize the worst case performance over an uncertainty set of Markov decision processes (MDPs). This set contains some perturbed MDPs from a nominal MDP (N-MDP) that generate samples for training, which reflects some potential mismatches between training (i.e., N-MDP) and true environments. In this paper we present an elaborated uncertainty set by excluding some implausible MDPs from the existing sets. Under this uncertainty set, we develop a sample-based RRL algorithm (named ARQ-Learning) for tabular setting and characterize its finite-time error bound. Also, it is proved that ARQ-Learning converges as fast as the standard Q-Learning and robust Q-Learning while ensuring better robustness. We introduce an additional pessimistic agent which can tackle the major bottleneck for the extension of ARQ-Learning into the cases with larger or continuous state spaces. Incorporating this idea into RL algorithms, we propose double-agent algorithms for model-free RRL. Via experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms",

    "abstract": "The study of complex human interactions and group activities has become a focal point in human-centric computer vision. However, progress in related tasks is often hindered by the challenges of obtaining large-scale labeled datasets from real-world scenarios. To address the limitation, we introduce M3Act, a synthetic data generator for multi-view multi-group multi-person human atomic actions and group activities. Powered by the Unity engine, M3Act features multiple semantic groups, highly diverse and photorealistic images, and a comprehensive set of annotations, which facilitates the learning of human-centered tasks across single-person, multi-person, and multi-group conditions. We demonstrate the advantages of M3Act across three core experiments using various input modalities. First, adding our synthetic data significantly improves the performance of MOTRv2 on DanceTrack, leading to a hop on the leaderboard from 10th to 2nd place. With M3Act, we achieve tracking results on par with MOTRv2*, which is trained with 62.5% more real-world data. Second, M3Act improves the benchmark performances on CAD2 by 5.59% and 7.43% on group activity and atomic action accuracy respectively. Moreover, M3Act opens new research for controllable 3D group activity generation. We define multiple metrics and propose a competitive baseline for the novel task",

This paper proposes a token-level detection method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. As a result, we propose two methods: one that identifies each token as either being part of an adversarial prompt or not, and another that estimates the probability of each token being part of an adversarial prompt",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Neural network based computer vision systems are typically built on a backbone, a pretrained or randomly initialized feature extractor. Several years ago, the default option was an ImageNet-trained convolutional neural network. However, the recent past has seen the emergence of countless backbones pretrained using various algorithms and datasets. While this abundance of choice has led to performance increases for a range of systems, it is difficult for practitioners to make informed decisions about which backbone to choose. Battle of the Backbones (BoB) makes this choice easier by benchmarking a diverse suite of pretrained models, including vision-language models, those trained via self-supervised learning, and the Stable Diffusion backbone, across a diverse set of computer vision tasks ranging from classification to object detection to OOD generalization and more. Furthermore, BoB sheds light on promising directions for the research community to advance computer vision by illuminating strengths and weakness of existing approaches through a comprehensive analysis conducted on more than 1500 training runs. While vision transformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised fashion on large training sets still perform best on most tasks among the models we consider. Moreover, in apples-to-apples comparisons on the same architectures and similarly sized pretraining datasets, we find that SSL backbones are highly competitive, indicating that future works should perform SSL pretraining with advanced architectures and larger pretraining datasets.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "LoRA achieves remarkable resource efficiency and comparable performance when adapting LLMs for specific tasks. Since ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance on various tasks, there has been a growing desire to adapt one model for all tasks. However, the explicit low-rank of LoRA limits the adaptation performance in complex multi-task scenarios. LoRA is dominated by a small number of top singular vectors while fine-tuning decomposes into a set of less important unitary transforms. In this paper, we propose MultiLoRA for better multi-task adaptation by reducing the dominance of top singular vectors observed in LoRA. MultiLoRA scales LoRA modules horizontally and change parameter initialization of adaptation matrices to reduce parameter dependency, thus yields more balanced unitary subspaces. We unprecedentedly construct specialized training data by mixing datasets of instruction follow, natural language understanding, world knowledge, to cover semantically and syntactically different samples. With only 2.5% of additional parameters, MultiLoRA outperforms single LoRA counterparts and fine-tuning on multiple benchmarks and model scales. Further investigation into weight update matrices of MultiLoRA exhibits reduced dependency on top singular vectors and more democratic unitary transform contributions",

Therefore, it is crucial to develop a model that can effectively capture emergent dynamics at the macro-level and quantify emergence based on the available data. Drawing inspiration from the theory of causal emergence, this paper introduces a machine learning framework aimed at learning macro-dynamics within an emergent latent space. The framework achieves this by maximizing the effective information (EI) to obtain a macro-dynamics model with stronger causal effects. Experimental results on both simulated and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Not only does it successfully capture emergent patterns, but it also learns the coarse-graining strategy and quantifies the degree of causal emergence in the data.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Existing learning methods often struggle to balance interpretability and predictive performance. While models like nearest neighbors and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) offer high interpretability, their predictive performance on supervised learning tasks is often limited. In contrast, neural networks based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) support the modular construction of expressive architectures and tend to have better recognition accuracy but are often regarded as black boxes in terms of interpretability. Our approach aims to strike a better balance between these two aspects through the use of a building block based on NMF that incorporates supervised neural network training methods to achieve high predictive performance while retaining the desirable interpretability properties of NMF. We evaluate our Predictive Factorized Coupling (PFC) block on small datasets and show that it achieves competitive predictive performance with MLPs while also offering improved interpretability. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in various scenarios, such as continual learning, training on non-i.i.d. data, and knowledge removal after training. Additionally, we show examples of using the PFC block to build more expressive architectures, including a fully-connected residual network as well as a factorized recurrent neural network (RNN) that performs competitively with vanilla RNNs while providing improved interpretability. The PFC block uses an iterative inference algorithm that converges to a fixed point, making it possible to trade off accuracy vs computation after training but also currently preventing its use as a general MLP replacement in some scenarios such as training on very large datasets.

However, due to the fact that medical image annotation requires a great deal of manpower and expertise, as well as the fact that clinical departments perform image annotation based on task orientation, there is the problem of having fewer medical image annotation data with more unlabeled data and having many datasets that annotate only a single organ. In this paper, we present UniMOS, the first universal framework for achieving the utilization of fully and partially labeled images as well as unlabeled images. Specifically, we construct a Multi-Organ Segmentation (MOS) module over fully/partially labeled data as the basenet and designed a new target adaptive loss. Furthermore, we incorporate a semi-supervised training module that combines consistent regularization and pseudolabeling techniques on unlabeled data, which significantly improves the segmentation of unlabeled data.

    "abstract": "Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks, making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$ matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI",

    "title": "Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Gaussian denoising has emerged as a powerful principle for constructing simulation-free continuous normalizing flows for generative modeling. Despite their empirical successes, theoretical properties of these flows and the regularizing effect of Gaussian denoising have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we aim to address this gap by investigating the well-posedness of simulation-free continuous normalizing flows built on Gaussian denoising. Through a unified framework termed Gaussian interpolation flow, we establish the Lipschitz regularity of the flow velocity field, the existence and uniqueness of the flow, and the Lipschitz continuity of the flow map and the time-reversed flow map for several rich classes of target distributions. This analysis also sheds light on the auto-encoding and cycle-consistency properties of Gaussian interpolation flows. Additionally, we delve into the stability of these flows in source distributions and perturbations of the velocity field, using the quadratic Wasserstein distance as a metric. Our findings offer valuable insights into the learning techniques employed in Gaussian interpolation flows for generative modeling, providing a solid theoretical foundation for end-to-end error analyses of learning GIFs with empirical observations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for representation learning on graphs, but they often suffer from overfitting and label noise issues, especially when the data is scarce or imbalanced. Different from the paradigm of previous methods that rely on single-node confidence, in this paper, we introduce a novel Class-wise Selection for Graph Neural Networks, dubbed CSGNN, which employs a neighbor-aggregated latent space to adaptively select reliable nodes across different classes. Specifically, 1) to tackle the class imbalance issue, we introduce a dynamic class-wise selection mechanism, leveraging the clustering technique to identify clean nodes based on the neighbor-aggregated confidences. In this way, our approach can avoid the pitfalls of biased sampling which is common with global threshold techniques. 2) To alleviate the problem of noisy labels, built on the concept of the memorization effect, CSGNN prioritizes learning from clean nodes before noisy ones, thereby iteratively enhancing model performance while mitigating label noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CSGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and robustness",

    "title": "SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively",

    "title": "Towards a Post-Market Monitoring Framework for Machine Learning-based Medical Devices: A case study",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed in clinical practice, performance monitoring is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the algorithm over time. The goal of this work is to highlight the complexity of designing a monitoring strategy and the need for a systematic framework that compares the multitude of monitoring options. One of the main decisions is choosing between using real-world (observational) versus interventional data. Although the former is the most convenient source of monitoring data, it exhibits well-known biases, such as confounding, selection, and missingness. In fact, when the ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm itself may be a primary source of bias. On the other hand, a carefully designed interventional study that randomizes individuals can explicitly eliminate such biases, but the ethics, feasibility, and cost of such an approach must be carefully considered. Beyond the decision of the data source, monitoring strategies vary in the performance criteria they track, the interpretability of the test statistics, the strength of their assumptions, and their speed at detecting performance decay. As a first step towards developing a framework that compares the various monitoring options, we consider a case study of an ML-based risk prediction algorithm for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Bringing together tools from causal inference and statistical process control, we walk through the basic steps of defining candidate monitoring criteria, describing potential sources of bias and the causal model, and specifying and comparing candidate monitoring procedures. We hypothesize that these steps can be applied more generally, as causal inference can address other sources of biases as well",

To delve into the adaptability evaluation on pre-trained models for CAN intrusion detection, we have developed two distinct models: CAN-SecureBERT and CAN-LLAMA2. Notably, our CAN-LLAMA2 model surpasses the state-of-the-art models by achieving an exceptional performance 0.999993 in terms of balanced accuracy, precision detection rate, F1 score, and a remarkably low false alarm rate of 3.10e-6. Impressively, the false alarm rate is 52 times smaller than that of the leading model, MTH-IDS (Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System).

    "abstract": "Intrinsically motivated exploration has proven useful for reinforcement learning, even without additional extrinsic rewards. When the environment is naturally represented as a graph, how to guide exploration best remains an open question. In this work, we propose a novel approach for exploring graph-structured data motivated by two theories of human curiosity: the information gap theory and the compression progress theory. The theories view curiosity as an intrinsic motivation to optimize for topological features of subgraphs induced by nodes visited in the environment. We use these proposed features as rewards for graph neural-network-based reinforcement learning. On multiple classes of synthetically generated graphs, we find that trained agents generalize to longer exploratory walks and larger environments than are seen during training. Our method computes more efficiently than the greedy evaluation of the relevant topological properties. The proposed intrinsic motivations bear particular relevance for recommender systems. We demonstrate that next-node recommendations considering curiosity are more predictive of human choices than PageRank centrality in several real-world graph environments, including MovieLens, Amazon Books, and Wikipedia",

    "abstract": "Space weather phenomena like geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) pose significant risks to critical technological infrastructure. While traditional predictive models, grounded in simulation, hold theoretical robustness, they grapple with challenges, notably the assimilation of imprecise data and extensive computational complexities. In recent years, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has been adopted to develop Machine Learning (ML)-enabled magnetometer systems for predicting real-time terrestrial magnetic perturbations as a proxy measure for GIC. While TinyML offers efficient, real-time data processing, its intrinsic limitations prevent the utilization of robust methods with high computational needs. This paper developed a physics-guided TinyML framework to address the above challenges. This framework integrates physics-based regularization at the stages of model training and compression, thereby augmenting the reliability of predictions. The developed pruning scheme within the framework harnesses the inherent physical characteristics of the domain, striking a balance between model size and robustness. The study presents empirical results, drawing a comprehensive comparison between the accuracy and reliability of the developed framework and its traditional counterpart. Such a comparative analysis underscores the prospective applicability of the developed framework in conceptualizing robust, ML-enabled magnetometer systems for real-time space weather forecasting",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Structure determination is necessary to identify unknown organic molecules, such as those in natural products, forensic samples, the interstellar medium, and laboratory syntheses. Rotational spectroscopy enables structure determination by providing accurate 3D information about small organic molecules via their moments of inertia. Using these moments, Kraitchman analysis determines isotopic substitution coordinates, which are the unsigned $|x|,|y|,|z|$ coordinates of all atoms with natural isotopic abundance, including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. While unsigned substitution coordinates can verify guesses of structures, the missing $+/-$ signs make it challenging to determine the actual structure from the substitution coordinates alone. To tackle this inverse problem, we develop KREED (Kraitchman REflection-Equivariant Diffusion), a generative diffusion model that infers a molecule's complete 3D structure from its molecular formula, moments of inertia, and unsigned substitution coordinates of heavy atoms. KREED's top-1 predictions identify the correct 3D structure with >98% accuracy on the QM9 and GEOM datasets when provided with substitution coordinates of all heavy atoms with natural isotopic abundance. When substitution coordinates are restricted to only a subset of carbons, accuracy is retained at 91% on QM9 and 32% on GEOM. On a test set of experimentally measured substitution coordinates gathered from the literature, KREED predicts the correct all-atom 3D structure in 25 of 33 cases, demonstrating experimental applicability for context-free 3D structure determination with rotational spectroscopy",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Travelling Salesperson Problems (TSPs) and Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) have achieved reasonable improvement in accuracy and computation time with the adaptation of Machine Learning (ML) methods. However, none of the previous works completely respects the symmetries arising from TSPs and VRPs including rotation, translation, permutation, and scaling. In this work, we introduce the first-ever completely equivariant model and training to solve combinatorial problems. Furthermore, it is essential to capture the multiscale structure (i.e. from local to global information) of the input graph, especially for the cases of large and long-range graphs, while previous methods are limited to extracting only local information that can lead to a local or sub-optimal solution. To tackle the above limitation, we propose a Multiresolution scheme in combination with Equivariant Graph Attention network (mEGAT) architecture, which can learn the optimal route based on low-level and high-level graph resolutions in an efficient way. In particular, our approach constructs a hierarchy of coarse-graining graphs from the input graph, in which we try to solve the routing problems on simple low-level graphs first, then utilize that knowledge for the more complex high-level graphs. Experimentally, we have shown that our model outperforms existing baselines and proved that symmetry preservation and multiresolution are important recipes for solving combinatorial problems in a data-driven manner.

Most of these measures fall into one of two categories. First, measures such as linear regression, canonical correlations analysis (CCA), and shape distances, all learn explicit mappings between neural units to quantify similarity while accounting for expected invariances. Second, measures such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel alignment (CKA), and normalized Bures similarity (NBS) all quantify similarity in summary statistics, such as stimulus-by-stimulus kernel matrices, which are already invariant to expected symmetries. Here, we take steps towards unifying these two broad categories of methods by observing that the cosine of the Riemannian shape distance (from category 1) is equal to NBS (from category 2). We explore how this connection leads to new interpretations of shape distances and NBS, and draw contrasts of these measures with CKA, a popular similarity measure in the deep learning literature",

In addition, we show that deterministic and randomized realizable learnability are equivalent if the Helly number of the collection of sets that can be revealed as feedback is finite. In light of this separation, we give two new combinatorial dimensions, named the Set Littlestone and Measure Shattering dimension, whose finiteness characterizes deterministic and randomized realizable learnability respectively. Additionally, these dimensions lower- and upper bound the deterministic and randomized minimax regret in the realizable setting. Going beyond the realizable setting, we prove that the Measure shattering dimension continues to characterize learnability and quantify minimax regret in the agnostic setting. Finally, we use our results to establish bounds on the minimax regret for three practical learning settings: online multilabel ranking, online multilabel classification, and real-valued prediction with interval-valued response",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Many areas of science make extensive use of computer simulators that implicitly encode intractable likelihood functions of complex systems. Classical statistical methods are poorly suited for these so-called likelihood-free inference (LFI) settings, especially outside asymptotic and low-dimensional regimes. At the same time, traditional LFI methods - such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or more recent machine learning techniques - do not guarantee confidence sets with nominal coverage in general settings (i.e., with high-dimensional data, finite sample sizes, and for any parameter value). In addition, there are no diagnostic tools to check the empirical coverage of confidence sets provided by such methods across the entire parameter space. In this work, we propose a unified and modular inference framework that bridges classical statistics and modern machine learning providing (i) a practical approach to the Neyman construction of confidence sets with frequentist finite-sample coverage for any value of the unknown parameters; and (ii) interpretable diagnostics that estimate the empirical coverage across the entire parameter space. We refer to the general framework as likelihood-free frequentist inference (LF2I). Any method that defines a test statistic can leverage LF2I to create valid confidence sets and diagnostics without costly Monte Carlo samples at fixed parameter settings. We study the power of two likelihood-based test statistics (ACORE and BFF) and demonstrate their empirical performance on high-dimensional, complex data.

We observe that the performance of offline RL for the RRM problem depends critically on the behavior policy used for data collection, and further propose a novel offline RL solution that leverages heterogeneous datasets collected by different behavior policies.

    "abstract": "There exist a wide range of single number metrics for assessing performance of classification algorithms, including AUC and the F1-score (Wikipedia lists 17 such metrics, with 27 different names). In this article, I propose a new metric to answer the following question: when an algorithm is tuned so that it can no longer distinguish labelled cats from real cats, how often does a randomly chosen image that has been labelled as containing a cat actually contain a cat? The steps to construct this metric are as follows. First, we set a threshold score such that when the algorithm is shown two randomly-chosen images -- one that has a score greater than the threshold (i.e. a picture labelled as containing a cat) and another from those pictures that really does contain a cat -- the probability that the image with the highest score is the one chosen from the set of real cat images is 50\\%. At this decision threshold, the set of positively labelled images are indistinguishable from the set of images which are positive. Then, as a second step, we measure performance by asking how often a randomly chosen picture from those labelled as containing a cat actually contains a cat. This metric can be thought of as {\\it precision at the indistinguishability threshold}. While this new metric doesn't address the tradeoff between precision and recall inherent to all such metrics, I do show why this method avoids pitfalls that can occur when using, for example AUC, and it is better motivated than, for example, the F1-score",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

Recent application of deep learning methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined. Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical priors. Our results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework compared to recent low-dose CT reconstruction methods",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) permeate more and more applications, an assessment of their associated security risks becomes increasingly necessary. The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a gap in current research by focusing on the security risks posed by LLMs, which extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication pipeline, explicitly focusing on prompt-based attacks on LLMs. We categorize the attacks by target and attack type within a prompt-based interaction scheme. The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and trustworthiness",

However, tackling time-series analysis tasks usually involves designing and training a separate model from scratch leveraging training data and domain expertise specific to the task. We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a general time-series model from multiple heterogeneous time-series dataset: providing semantically useful inputs to models for modeling time series of different dynamics from different domains. We observe that partitioning time-series into segments as inputs to sequential models produces semantically better inputs and propose a novel model LPTM that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy leveraging self-supervised learning loss during pre-training. LPTM provides performance similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model and is significantly more data and compute efficient taking up to 40% less data as well as 50% less training time to achieve state-of-art performance in a wide range of time-series analysis tasks from multiple disparate domain",

    "title": "Negotiated Representations for Machine Mearning Application",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is trained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training samples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive rules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise, and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to explore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the community to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related challenges in other research fields such as continual learning.

Recent works have shown that leveraging data-driven solutions that utilize advances in deep learning methods to learn from past data of an epidemic often outperform traditional mechanistic models. However, in many cases, the past data is sparse and may not sufficiently capture the underlying dynamics. While there exists a large amount of data from past epidemics, leveraging prior knowledge from time-series data of other diseases is a non-trivial challenge. Motivated by the success of pre-trained models in language and vision tasks, we tackle the problem of pre-training epidemic time-series models to learn from multiple datasets from different diseases and epidemics. We introduce Pre-trained Epidemic Time-Series Models (PEMS) that learn from diverse time-series datasets of a variety of diseases by formulating pre-training as a set of self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. We tackle various important challenges specific to pre-training for epidemic time-series such as dealing with heterogeneous dynamics and efficiently capturing useful patterns from multiple epidemic datasets by carefully designing the SSL tasks to learn important priors about the epidemic dynamics that can be leveraged for fine-tuning to multiple downstream tasks. The resultant PEM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in various downstream time-series tasks across datasets of varying seasonal patterns, geography, and mechanism of contagion including the novel Covid-19 pandemic unseen in pre-trained data with better efficiency using smaller fraction of datasets",

Due to the sequential nature of simulating these neural models, a commonly faced issue is the speed-accuracy trade-off: either accurately simulate a neuron using a small discretisation time-step (DT), which is slow, or more quickly simulate a neuron using a larger DT and incur a loss in simulation accuracy. Here we provide a solution to this dilemma, by algorithmically reinterpreting the ALIF model, reducing the sequential simulation complexity and permitting a more efficient parallelisation on GPUs. We computationally validate our implementation to obtain over a $50\\times$ training speedup using small DTs on synthetic benchmarks. We also obtained a comparable performance to the standard ALIF implementation on different supervised classification tasks - yet in a fraction of the training time. Lastly, we showcase how our model makes it possible to quickly and accurately fit real electrophysiological recordings of cortical neurons, where very fine sub-millisecond DTs are crucial for capturing exact spike timing",

Nevertheless, the pursuit of learning a shared set of diverse representations is still an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for representation learning in MTRL that encapsulates common structures among the tasks using orthogonal representations to promote diversity. Our method, named Mixture Of Orthogonal Experts (MOORE), leverages a Gram-Schmidt process to shape a shared subspace of representations generated by a mixture of experts. When task-specific information is provided, MOORE generates relevant representations from this shared subspace.

    "abstract": "Accurate simulation of deformable linear object (DLO) dynamics is challenging if the task at hand requires a human-interpretable model that also yields fast predictions. To arrive at such a model, we draw inspiration from the rigid finite element method (R-FEM) and model a DLO as a serial chain of rigid bodies whose internal state is unrolled through time by a dynamics network. As this state is not observed directly, the dynamics network is trained jointly with a physics-informed encoder which maps observed motion variables to the DLO's hidden state. To encourage that the state acquires a physically meaningful representation, we leverage the forward kinematics of the underlying R-FEM model as a decoder. Through robot experiments we demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides an easy-to-handle, yet capable DLO dynamics model yielding physically interpretable predictions from partial observations.

    "abstract": "We consider the dynamics and the interactions of multiple reinforcement learning optimal execution trading agents interacting with a reactive Agent-Based Model (ABM) of a financial market in event time. The model represents a market ecology with 3-trophic levels represented by: optimal execution learning agents, minimally intelligent liquidity takers, and fast electronic liquidity providers. The optimal execution agent classes include buying and selling agents that can either use a combination of limit orders and market orders, or only trade using market orders. The reward function explicitly balances trade execution slippage against the penalty of not executing the order timeously. This work demonstrates how multiple competing learning agents impact a minimally intelligent market simulation as functions of the number of agents, the size of agents' initial orders, and the state spaces used for learning. We use phase space plots to examine the dynamics of the ABM, when various specifications of learning agents are included. Further, we examine whether the inclusion of optimal execution agents that can learn is able to produce dynamics with the same complexity as empirical data. We find that the inclusion of optimal execution agents changes the stylised facts produced by ABM to conform more with empirical data, and are a necessary inclusion for ABMs investigating market micro-structure. However, including execution agents to chartist-fundamentalist-noise ABMs is insufficient to recover the complexity observed in empirical data",

However, most of these methods rely on pairwise relations in the graph and do not capture the underling higher-order relations between entities. Hypergraphs are versatile and expressive structures that can effectively model higher-order relationships among entities in the data. Despite the efforts to adapt GNNs to hypergraphs (HyperGNN), there are currently no fully self-supervised pretraining methods for HyperGNN on heterogeneous hypergraphs. In this paper, we present SPHH, a novel self-supervised pretraining framework for heterogeneous HyperGNNs. Our method is able to effectively capture higher-order relations among entities in the data in a self-supervised manner. SPHH is consist of two self-supervised pretraining tasks that aim to simultaneously learn both local and global representations of the entities in the hypergraph by using informative representations derived from the hypergraph structure. Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of self-supervised pretraining of HyperGNNs, and has the potential to improve the performance of various graph-based downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction tasks which are mapped to hypergraph configuration. Our experiments on two real-world benchmarks using four different HyperGNN models show that our proposed SPHH framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SPHH is able to improve the performance of various HyperGNN models in various downstream tasks, regardless of their architecture or complexity, which highlights the robustness of our framework",

Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/KerryDRX/EvidentialADA. This alternative means of evidential uncertainty quantification will give researchers more options when class uncertainties and correlations are important in their applications",

    "abstract": "Data-driven models created by machine learning gain in importance in all fields of design and engineering. They have high potential to assist decision-makers in creating novel artefacts with better performance and sustainability. However, limited generalization and the black-box nature of these models lead to limited explainability and reusability. To overcome this situation, we propose a component-based approach to create partial component models by machine learning (ML). This component-based approach aligns deep learning with systems engineering (SE). For the domain of energy efficient building design, we first demonstrate better generalization of the component-based method by analyzing prediction accuracy outside the training data. We observe a much higher accuracy (R2 = 0.94) compared to conventional monolithic methods (R2 = 0.71). Second, we illustrate explainability by exemplary demonstrating how sensitivity information from SE and rules from low-depth decision trees serve engineering. Third, we evaluate explainability by qualitative and quantitative methods demonstrating the matching of preliminary knowledge and data-driven derived strategies and show correctness of activations at component interfaces compared to white-box simulation results (envelope components: R2 = 0.92..0.99; zones: R2 = 0.78..0.93). The key for component-based explainability is that activations at interfaces between the components are interpretable engineering quantities. The large range of possible configurations in composing components allows the examination of novel unseen design cases with understandable data-driven models. The matching of parameter ranges of components by similar probability distribution produces reusable, well-generalizing, and trustworthy models. The approach adapts the model structure to engineering methods of systems engineering and to domain knowledge",

To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations for MPM, including the $\\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting.

We investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space for conditioning the generative model.

Unlike traditional integer differencing methods, FD preserves memory in series while stabilizing it for modeling purposes. By applying FD to financial data from the SPY index and incorporating sentiment analysis from news reports, this empirical analysis explores the effectiveness of FD in conjunction with binary classification of target variables. Supervised classification algorithms were employed to validate the performance of FD series. The results demonstrate the superiority of FD over integer differencing, as confirmed by Receiver Operating Characteristic/Area Under the Curve (ROCAUC) and Mathews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) evaluations",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. BO has several well-documented shortcomings, including computational slowdown with longer optimization runs, poor suitability for non-stationary or ill-conditioned objective functions, and poor convergence characteristics. Several algorithms have been proposed that incorporate local strategies, such as trust regions, into BO to mitigate these limitations; however, none address all of them satisfactorily. To address these shortcomings, we propose the LABCAT algorithm, which extends trust-region-based BO by adding principal-component-aligned rotation and an adaptive rescaling strategy based on the length-scales of a local Gaussian process surrogate model with automatic relevance determination. Through extensive numerical experiments using a set of synthetic test functions and the well-known COCO benchmarking software, we show that the LABCAT algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art BO and other black-box optimization algorithms",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATEs are non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose to perform partial identification of CATEs or, equivalently, aim at estimating of lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant progress made in practical applications of aligned language models (LMs), they tend to be overconfident in output answers compared to the corresponding pre-trained LMs. In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of the alignment process on logit-based uncertainty calibration of LMs under the multiple-choice setting. We first conduct a thoughtful empirical study on how aligned LMs differ in calibration from their pre-trained counterparts. Experimental results reveal that there are two distinct uncertainties in LMs under the multiple-choice setting, which are responsible for the answer decision and the format preference of the LMs, respectively. Then, we investigate the role of these two uncertainties on aligned LM's calibration through fine-tuning in simple synthetic alignment schemes and conclude that one reason for aligned LMs' overconfidence is the conflation of these two types of uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine the utility of common post-hoc calibration methods for aligned LMs and propose an easy-to-implement and sample-efficient method to calibrate aligned LMs. We hope our findings could provide insights into the design of more reliable alignment processes for LMs",

In this pursuit of quantum advantage, the quantum kernel method for support vector machine has emerged as a powerful approach. Entanglement, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, assumes a central role in quantum computing. In this paper, we investigate the optimal number of entanglement gates in the quantum kernel feature maps by a multi-objective genetic algorithm. We distinct the fitness functions of genetic algorithm for non-local gates for entanglement and local gates to gain insights into the benefits of employing entanglement gates. Our experiments reveal that the optimal configuration of quantum circuits for the quantum kernel method incorporates a proportional number of non-local gates for entanglement. The result complements the prior literature on quantum kernel generation where non-local gates were largely suppressed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the separability indexes of data can be leveraged to estimate the number of non-local gates required for the quantum support vector machine's feature maps. This insight can be helpful in selecting appropriate parameters, such as the entanglement parameter, in various quantum programming packages like https://qiskit.org/ based on data analysis.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a source free domain adaptation method for steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) spellers. SSVEP-based BCI spellers assist individuals experiencing speech difficulties by enabling them to communicate at a fast rate. However, achieving a high information transfer rate (ITR) in most prominent methods requires an extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for new users. We address this issue by proposing a novel method that adapts a powerful deep neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (data from former users or participants of previous experiments) to the new user (target domain), based only on the unlabeled target data. This adaptation is achieved by minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and local-regularity terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and forces the DNN to assign similar labels to adjacent instances. The proposed method priorities user comfort by removing the burden of calibration while maintaining an excellent character identification accuracy and ITR. In particular, our method achieves striking 201.15 bits/min and 145.02 bits/min ITRs on the benchmark and BETA datasets, respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives.

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) often relies on the availability of extensive annotated datasets, an assumption that is unrealistically time-consuming and costly in practice. We explore a novel paradigm termed name-only continual learning where time and cost constraints prohibit manual annotation. In this scenario, learners adapt to new category shifts using only category names without the luxury of annotated training data. Our proposed solution leverages the expansive and ever-evolving internet to query and download uncurated webly-supervised data for image classification. We investigate the reliability of our web data and find them comparable, and in some cases superior, to manually annotated datasets. Additionally, we show that by harnessing the web, we can create support sets that surpass state-of-the-art name-only classification that create support sets using generative models or image retrieval from LAION-5B, achieving up to 25% boost in accuracy. When applied across varied continual learning contexts, our method consistently exhibits a small performance gap in comparison to models trained on manually annotated datasets. We present EvoTrends, a class-incremental dataset made from the web to capture real-world trends, created in just minutes. Overall, this paper underscores the potential of using uncurated webly-supervised data to mitigate the challenges associated with manual data labeling in continual learning",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Time series is a special type of sequence data, a sequence of real-valued random variables collected at even intervals of time. The real-world multivariate time series comes with noises and contains complicated local and global temporal dynamics, making it difficult to forecast the future time series given the historical observations. This work proposes a simple and effective framework, coined as TimeSQL, which leverages multi-scale patching and smooth quadratic loss (SQL) to tackle the above challenges. The multi-scale patching transforms the time series into two-dimensional patches with different length scales, facilitating the perception of both locality and long-term correlations in time series. SQL is derived from the rational quadratic kernel and can dynamically adjust the gradients to avoid overfitting to the noises and outliers. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild conditions, the effect of the noises on the model with SQL is always smaller than that with MSE. Based on the two modules, TimeSQL achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the eight real-world benchmark datasets. Further ablation studies indicate that the key modules in TimeSQL could also enhance the results of other models for multivariate time series forecasting, standing as plug-and-play techniques",

    "abstract": "An intelligent decision-making system enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications is essential to achieve safe and efficient autonomous driving (AD), where two types of decisions have to be made at different timescales, i.e., vehicle control and radio resource allocation (RRA) decisions. The interplay between RRA and vehicle control necessitates their collaborative design. In this two-part paper (Part I and Part II), taking platoon control (PC) as an example use case, we propose a joint optimization framework of multi-timescale control and communications (MTCC) based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this paper (Part I), we first decompose the problem into a communication-aware DRL-based PC sub-problem and a control-aware DRL-based RRA sub-problem. Then, we focus on the PC sub-problem assuming an RRA policy is given, and propose the MTCC-PC algorithm to learn an efficient PC policy. To improve the PC performance under random observation delay, the PC state space is augmented with the observation delay and PC action history. Moreover, the reward function with respect to the augmented state is defined to construct an augmented state Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is proved that the optimal policy for the augmented state MDP is optimal for the original PC problem with observation delay. Different from most existing works on communication-aware control, the MTCC-PC algorithm is trained in a delayed environment generated by the fine-grained embedded simulation of C-V2X communications rather than by a simple stochastic delay model. Finally, experiments are performed to compare the performance of MTCC-PC with those of the baseline DRL algorithms",

To address this issue, we propose a reformulation of bilevel optimization as a minimax problem, effectively decoupling the outer-inner dependency. Under mild conditions, we show these two problems are equivalent.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) becomes increasingly critical as neural networks (NNs) are being widely adopted in addressing complex problems across various scientific disciplines. Representative SciML models are physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). While UQ in SciML has been increasingly investigated in recent years, very few works have focused on addressing the uncertainty caused by the noisy inputs, such as spatial-temporal coordinates in PINNs and input functions in NOs. The presence of noise in the inputs of the models can pose significantly more challenges compared to noise in the outputs of the models, primarily due to the inherent nonlinearity of most SciML algorithms. As a result, UQ for noisy inputs becomes a crucial factor for reliable and trustworthy deployment of these models in applications involving physical knowledge. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty arising from noisy inputs-outputs in PINNs and NOs. We show that this approach can be seamlessly integrated into PINNs and NOs, when they are employed to encode the physical information. PINNs incorporate physics by including physics-informed terms via automatic differentiation, either in the loss function or the likelihood, and often take as input the spatial-temporal coordinate. Therefore, the present method equips PINNs with the capability to address problems where the observed coordinate is subject to noise. On the other hand, pretrained NOs are also commonly employed as equation-free surrogates in solving differential equations and Bayesian inverse problems, in which they take functions as inputs. The proposed approach enables them to handle noisy measurements for both input and output functions with UQ",

We introduce a human-in-the-loop deep learning framework leveraging OpenEarthMap, a recently introduced benchmark dataset for global submeter-level land cover mapping, with a U-Net model that achieves national-scale mapping with a small amount of additional labeled data. By adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall accuracy of 80\\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of eight classes for the entire country of Japan.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "As IoT devices become widely, it is crucial to protect them from malicious intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To address this, in this paper we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner. The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion. Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge, a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9%",

    "abstract": "Multimodal federated learning (FL) aims to enrich model training in FL settings where devices are collecting measurements across multiple modalities (e.g., sensors measuring pressure, motion, and other types of data). However, key challenges to multimodal FL remain unaddressed, particularly in heterogeneous network settings: (i) the set of modalities collected by each device will be diverse, and (ii) communication limitations prevent devices from uploading all their locally trained modality models to the server. In this paper, we propose Federated Multimodal Fusion learning with Selective modality communication (FedMFS), a new multimodal fusion FL methodology that can tackle the above mentioned challenges. The key idea is the introduction of a modality selection criterion for each device, which weighs (i) the impact of the modality, gauged by Shapley value analysis, against (ii) the modality model size as a gauge for communication overhead. This enables FedMFS to flexibly balance performance against communication costs, depending on resource constraints and application requirements. Experiments on the real-world ActionSense dataset demonstrate the ability of FedMFS to achieve comparable accuracy to several baselines while reducing the communication overhead by over 4x",

Additionally, many benchmark datasets suffer from the problem of having explicit anomalies that even random functions can detect. This problem is exacerbated by ill-posed evaluation metrics, known as point adjustment (PA), which can result in inflated model performance. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based Tri-domain Anomaly Detector (TriAD), which addresses these challenges by modeling features across three data domains - temporal, frequency, and residual domains - without relying on anomaly labels. Unlike traditional contrastive learning methods, TriAD employs both inter-domain and intra-domain contrastive loss to learn common attributes among normal data and differentiate them from anomalies. Additionally, our approach can detect anomalies of varying lengths by integrating with a discord discovery algorithm. It is worth noting that this study is the first to reevaluate the deep learning potential in TSAD, utilizing both rigorously designed datasets (i.e., UCR Archive) and evaluation metrics (i.e., PA%K and affiliation). Through experimental results on the UCR dataset, TriAD achieves an impressive three-fold increase in PA%K based F1 scores over SOTA deep learning models, and 50% increase of accuracy as compared to SOTA discord discovery algorithms",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Numerous web applications rely on solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as energy cost-aware scheduling, budget allocation on web advertising, and graph matching on social networks. However, many optimization problems involve unknown coefficients, and improper predictions of these factors may lead to inferior decisions which may cause energy wastage, inefficient resource allocation, inappropriate matching in social networks, etc. Such a research topic is referred to as \"Predict-Then-Optimize (PTO)\" which considers the performance of prediction and decision-making in a unified system. A noteworthy recent development is the end-to-end methods by directly optimizing the ultimate decision quality which claims to yield better results in contrast to the traditional two-stage approach. However, the evaluation benchmarks in this field are fragmented and the effectiveness of various models in different scenarios remains unclear, hindering the comprehensive assessment and fast deployment of these methods. To address these issues, we provide a comprehensive categorization of current approaches and integrate existing experimental scenarios to establish a unified benchmark, elucidating the circumstances under which end-to-end training yields improvements, as well as the contexts in which it performs ineffectively. We also introduce a new dataset for the industrial combinatorial advertising problem for inclusive finance to open-source. We hope the rethinking and benchmarking of PTO could facilitate more convenient evaluation and deployment, and inspire further improvements both in the academy and industry within this field",

    "abstract": "Molecular sciences address a wide range of problems involving molecules of different types and sizes and their complexes. Recently, geometric deep learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA 3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities. Our results highlight the potential for PAMNet in a broad range of molecular science applications",

    "title": "FedRA: A Random Allocation Strategy for Federated Tuning to Unleash the Power of Heterogeneous Clients",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of Foundation Models, federated tuning has garnered attention in the field of federated learning, utilizing data and computation resources from multiple clients to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models. However, in real-world federated scenarios, there often exist a multitude of heterogeneous clients with varying computation and communication resources, rendering them incapable of supporting the entire model fine-tuning process. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel federated tuning algorithm, FedRA. The implementation of FedRA is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated into any transformer-based model without the need for further modification to the original model. Specifically, in each communication round, FedRA randomly generates an allocation matrix. For resource-constrained clients, it reorganizes a small number of layers from the original model based on the allocation matrix and fine-tunes using LoRA. Subsequently, the server aggregates the updated LoRA parameters from the clients according to the current allocation matrix into the corresponding layers of the original model. It is worth noting that FedRA also supports scenarios where none of the clients can support the entire global model, which is an impressive advantage. We conduct experiments on two large-scale image datasets, DomainNet and NICO++, under various non-iid settings. The results demonstrate that FedRA outperforms the compared methods significantly.

    "title": "TextGuard: Provable Defense against Backdoor Attacks on Text Classification",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have become a major security threat for deploying machine learning models in security-critical applications. Existing research endeavors have proposed many defenses against backdoor attacks. Despite demonstrating certain empirical defense efficacy, none of these techniques could provide a formal and provable security guarantee against arbitrary attacks. As a result, they can be easily broken by strong adaptive attacks, as shown in our evaluation. In this work, we propose TextGuard, the first provable defense against backdoor attacks on text classification. In particular, TextGuard first divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger. Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the triggers in training and testing inputs. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGuard on three benchmark text classification tasks, surpassing the certification accuracy of existing certified defenses against backdoor attacks. Furthermore, we propose additional strategies to enhance the empirical performance of TextGuard. Comparisons with state-of-the-art empirical defenses validate the superiority of TextGuard in countering multiple backdoor attacks.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to molecular science have showcased the power of learning three-dimensional (3D) structure representations with GNNs. However, most existing GNNs suffer from the limitations of insufficient modeling of diverse interactions, computational expensive operations, and ignorance of vectorial values. Here, we tackle these limitations by proposing a novel GNN model, Physics-aware Multiplex Graph Neural Network (PaxNet), to efficiently and accurately learn the representations of 3D molecules for both small organic compounds and macromolecule complexes. PaxNet separates the modeling of local and non-local interactions inspired by molecular mechanics, and reduces the expensive angle-related computations. Besides scalar properties, PaxNet can also predict vectorial properties by learning an associated vector for each atom. To evaluate the performance of PaxNet, we compare it with state-of-the-art baselines in two tasks. On small molecule dataset for predicting quantum chemical properties, PaxNet reduces the prediction error by 15% and uses 73% less memory than the best baseline. On macromolecule dataset for predicting protein-ligand binding affinities, PaxNet outperforms the best baseline while reducing the memory consumption by 33% and the inference time by 85%. Thus, PaxNet provides a universal, robust and accurate method for large-scale machine learning of molecules. Our code is available at https://github.com/zetayue/Physics-aware-Multiplex-GNN",

    "title": "Can We Utilize Pre-trained Language Models within Causal Discovery Algorithms?",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Scaling laws have allowed Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) into the field of causal reasoning. Causal reasoning of PLM relies solely on text-based descriptions, in contrast to causal discovery which aims to determine the causal relationships between variables utilizing data. Recently, there has been current research regarding a method that mimics causal discovery by aggregating the outcomes of repetitive causal reasoning, achieved through specifically designed prompts. It highlights the usefulness of PLMs in discovering cause and effect, which is often limited by a lack of data, especially when dealing with multiple variables. Conversely, the characteristics of PLMs which are that PLMs do not analyze data and they are highly dependent on prompt design leads to a crucial limitation for directly using PLMs in causal discovery. Accordingly, PLM-based causal reasoning deeply depends on the prompt design and carries out the risk of overconfidence and false predictions in determining causal relationships. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the aforementioned limitations of PLM-based causal reasoning through experiments on physics-inspired synthetic data. Then, we propose a new framework that integrates prior knowledge obtained from PLM with a causal discovery algorithm. This is accomplished by initializing an adjacency matrix for causal discovery and incorporating regularization using prior knowledge. Our proposed framework not only demonstrates improved performance through the integration of PLM and causal discovery but also suggests how to leverage PLM-extracted prior knowledge with existing causal discovery algorithms",

In particular, we propose a novel deep RL framework with multiple actors and centralized critic (MACC) in which actors are implemented as pointer networks to fit the varying dimension of input. We evaluate the performance of the proposed deep RL algorithm via simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we develop a deep RL based jammer with limited prior information and limited power budget. The goal of the jammer is to minimize the transmission rates achieved with network slicing and thus degrade the network slicing agents' performance. We design a jammer with both listening and jamming phases and address jamming location optimization as well as jamming channel optimization via deep RL. We evaluate the jammer at the optimized location, generating interference attacks in the optimized set of channels by switching between the jamming phase and listening phase. We show that the proposed jammer can significantly reduce the victims' performance without direct feedback or prior knowledge on the network slicing policies. Finally, we devise a Nash-equilibrium-supervised policy ensemble mixed strategy profile for network slicing (as a defensive measure) and jamming. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy ensemble algorithm by applying on the network slicing agents and the jammer agent in simulations to show its effectiveness",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "The power-law distribution plays a crucial role in complex networks as well as various applied sciences. Investigating whether the degree distribution of a network follows a power-law distribution is an important concern. The commonly used inferential methods for estimating the model parameters often yield biased estimates, which can lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that a model conforms to a power-law. In this paper, we discuss improved methods that utilize Bayesian inference to obtain accurate estimates and precise credibility intervals. The inferential methods are derived for both continuous and discrete distributions. These methods reveal that objective Bayesian approaches return nearly unbiased estimates for the parameters of both models. Notably, in the continuous case, we identify an explicit posterior distribution. This work enhances the power of goodness-of-fit tests, enabling us to accurately discern whether a network or any other dataset adheres to a power-law distribution. We apply the proposed approach to fit degree distributions for more than 5,000 synthetic networks and over 3,000 real networks.

    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

We find that reward models do not learn to evaluate `instruction-following' by default and instead favor personas that resemble internet text. Techniques for interpreting reward models' internal representations achieve better generalization than standard fine-tuning, but still frequently fail to distinguish instruction-following from conflated behaviors.

Suppose the goal is to learn or test a property of the average distribution, $\\textbf{p}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.

Next, we tend to the question of an adaptivity for this setting, i.e. achieving the minimax rate without knowledge of $L$ or $V$. Quite importantly, we posit that the bandit problem, viewed locally at a given context $X_t$, should not be affected by reward changes in other parts of context space $\\cal X$. We therefore propose a notion of change, which we term experienced significant shifts, that better accounts for locality, and thus counts considerably less changes than $L$ and $V$. Furthermore, similar to recent work on non-stationary MAB (Suk & Kpotufe, 2022), experienced significant shifts only count the most significant changes in mean rewards, e.g., severe best-arm changes relevant to observed contexts.

Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models on these datasets sheds light on three pivotal considerations: 1) aligning an object's inherent utility with the task at hand, 2) navigating contextual dependencies (societal norms, safety, appropriateness, and efficiency), and 3) accounting for the current physical state of the object. To maintain accessibility, we introduce five abstract variables reflecting an object's physical condition, modulated by human insights to simulate diverse household scenarios.

We aim to assess the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in the task of zero-shot long document evidence retrieval, owing to their unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks. However, currently the LLMs can consume limited context lengths as input, thus providing document chunks as inputs might overlook the global context while missing out on capturing the inter-segment dependencies. Moreover, directly feeding the large input sets can incur significant computational costs, particularly when processing the entire document (and potentially incurring monetary expenses with enterprise APIs like OpenAI's GPT variants). To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques that exploit the discourse structure commonly found in documents. By utilizing this structure, we create a condensed representation of the document, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of relationships between different parts.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "A wide range of imaging techniques and data formats available for medical images make accurate retrieval from image databases challenging. Efficient retrieval systems are crucial in advancing medical research, enabling large-scale studies and innovative diagnostic tools. Thus, addressing the challenges of medical image retrieval is essential for the continued enhancement of healthcare and research. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality, body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information during retrieval of 3D volumes. We showed that medical image retrieval is feasible using pretrained networks without any additional training or fine-tuning steps. Using pretrained embeddings, we achieved a recall of 1 for various tasks at modality, body region, and organ level",

    "title": "Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum Computers",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be used with current systems. We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits, which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%)",

    "abstract": "The pre-trained language models are continually fine-tuned to better support downstream applications. However, this operation may result in significant performance degeneration on general tasks beyond the targeted domain. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method which enables the fine-tuned model to stay resilient in general perspectives. Our method is conducted in the form of model merging (namely LM-Cocktail), where the fine-tuned language model is merged with the pre-trained base model or the peer models from other domains through weighted average. Despite simplicity, LM-Cocktail is surprisingly effective: the resulted model is able to achieve a strong empirical performance in the whole scope of general tasks while preserving a superior capacity in its targeted domain.

    "title": "Pelvic floor MRI segmentation based on semi-supervised deep learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The semantic segmentation of pelvic organs via MRI has important clinical significance. Recently, deep learning-enabled semantic segmentation has facilitated the three-dimensional geometric reconstruction of pelvic floor organs, providing clinicians with accurate and intuitive diagnostic results. However, the task of labeling pelvic floor MRI segmentation, typically performed by clinicians, is labor-intensive and costly, leading to a scarcity of labels. Insufficient segmentation labels limit the precise segmentation and reconstruction of pelvic floor organs. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised framework for pelvic organ segmentation. The implementation of this framework comprises two stages. In the first stage, it performs self-supervised pre-training using image restoration tasks. Subsequently, fine-tuning of the self-supervised model is performed, using labeled data to train the segmentation model. In the second stage, the self-supervised segmentation model is used to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. Ultimately, both labeled and unlabeled data are utilized in semi-supervised training. Upon evaluation, our method significantly enhances the performance in the semantic segmentation and geometric reconstruction of pelvic organs, Dice coefficient can increase by 2.65% averagely. Especially for organs that are difficult to segment, such as the uterus, the accuracy of semantic segmentation can be improved by up to 3.70%",

The core part of our approach is a novel data scheduler, which employs \"spaced repetition\" and complexity formalisms to guide the training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several text graph tasks and graph neural network architectures. The proposed model gains more and uses less data; consistently prefers text over graph complexity indices throughout training, while the best curricula derived from text and graph complexity indices are equally effective; and it learns transferable curricula across GNN models and datasets.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Extending image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMM) to videos is challenging due to the inherent complexity of video data. The recent approaches extending image-based LMM to videos either lack the grounding capabilities (e.g., VideoChat, Video-ChatGPT, Video-LLaMA) or do not utilize the audio-signals for better video understanding (e.g., Video-ChatGPT). Addressing these gaps, we propose Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially and temporally localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5. Our framework builds on SoTA image-based LLaVA model and extends its advantages to the video domain, delivering promising gains on video-based conversation and grounding tasks.

In terms of defense semantics, we show that defenses related to self-attacked arguments and arguments in 3-cycles are unsatifiable under any situation and therefore can be removed without affecting the defense semantics of an AF. Then, we introduce a new notion of defense equivalence of AFs, and compare defense equivalence with standard equivalence and strong equivalence, respectively. Finally, by exploiting defense semantics, we define two kinds of reasons for accepting arguments, i.e., direct reasons and root reasons, and a notion of root equivalence of AFs that can be used in argumentation summarization",

    "title": "BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird's-Eye View",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) is a fundamental task of computer vision, proving essential for applications like autonomous driving. It remains challenging to localize the target from surroundings due to appearance variations, distractors, and the high sparsity of point clouds. The spatial information indicating objects' spatial adjacency across consecutive frames is crucial for effective object tracking. However, existing trackers typically employ point-wise representation with irregular formats, leading to insufficient use of this important spatial knowledge. As a result, these trackers usually require elaborate designs and solving multiple subtasks. In this paper, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective baseline that performs tracking in Bird's-Eye View (BEV). This representation greatly retains spatial information owing to its ordered structure and inherently encodes the implicit motion relations of the target as well as distractors. To achieve accurate regression for targets with diverse attributes (\\textit{e.g.}, sizes and motion patterns), BEVTrack constructs the likelihood function with the learned underlying distributions adapted to different targets, rather than making a fixed Laplace or Gaussian assumption as in previous works. This provides valuable priors for tracking and thus further boosts performance. While only using a single regression loss with a plain convolutional architecture, BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets, KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset while maintaining a high inference speed of about 200 FPS.

Probabilistic circuits guarantee inference that is polynomial in the size of the circuit. In this paper, we improve the explainability of probabilistic circuits by computing a comprehensible, readable logical theory that covers the high-density regions generated by a PC. To achieve this, pruning approaches based on generative significance are used in a new method called PUTPUT (Probabilistic circuit Understanding Through Pruning Underlying logical Theories). The method is applied to a real world use case where music playlists are automatically generated and expressed as readable (database) queries. Evaluation shows that this approach can effectively produce a comprehensible logical theory that describes the high-density regions of a PC and outperforms state of the art methods when exploring the performance-comprehensibility trade-off",

Moreover, the deployment of such LLM-based agents is both costly and time-consuming in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller scale specialized student agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent. By leveraging guided actions provided by the teachers, the prior knowledge of the LLM is distilled into the local student model. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less data. Furthermore, subsequent training with environment feedback empowers the student agents to surpass the capabilities of their teachers.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

    "abstract": "Most conventional crowd counting methods utilize a fully-supervised learning framework to establish a mapping between scene images and crowd density maps. They usually rely on a large quantity of costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations for training supervision. One way to mitigate the intensive labeling effort and improve counting accuracy is to leverage large amounts of unlabeled images. This is attributed to the inherent self-structural information and rank consistency within a single image, offering additional qualitative relation supervision during training. Contrary to earlier methods that utilized the rank relations at the original image level, we explore such rank-consistency relation within the latent feature spaces. This approach enables the incorporation of numerous pyramid partial orders, strengthening the model representation capability. A notable advantage is that it can also increase the utilization ratio of unlabeled samples. Specifically, we propose a Deep Rank-consistEnt pyrAmid Model (DREAM), which makes full use of rank consistency across coarse-to-fine pyramid features in latent spaces for enhanced crowd counting with massive unlabeled images. In addition, we have collected a new unlabeled crowd counting dataset, FUDAN-UCC, comprising 4,000 images for training purposes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets, namely UCF-QNRF, ShanghaiTech PartA and PartB, and UCF-CC-50, show the effectiveness of our method compared with previous semi-supervised methods.

By using only a small number of labeled examples, referred to as demonstrations, LLMs can effectively grasp the task at hand through in-context learning. However, the process of selecting appropriate demonstrations has received limited attention in prior work. This paper addresses the issue of identifying the most informative demonstrations for few-shot learning by approaching it as a pool-based Active Learning (AL) problem over a single iteration. Our objective is to investigate how AL algorithms can serve as effective demonstration selection methods for in-context learning. We compare various standard AL algorithms based on uncertainty, diversity, and similarity, and consistently observe that the latter outperforms all other methods, including random sampling. Notably, uncertainty sampling, despite its success in conventional supervised learning scenarios, performs poorly in this context. Our extensive experimentation involving a diverse range of GPT and OPT models across $24$ classification and multi-choice tasks, coupled with thorough analysis, unambiguously demonstrates that in-context example selection through AL prioritizes high-quality examples that exhibit low uncertainty and bear similarity to the test examples",

However, segmenting dermoscopic images without manual labeling guidance presents significant challenges due to dermoscopic image artifacts such as hair noise, blister noise, and subtle edge differences. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative Uncertainty Self-Learning Network (USL-Net) designed for skin lesion segmentation. The USL-Net can effectively segment a range of lesions, eliminating the need for manual labeling guidance. Initially, features are extracted using contrastive learning, followed by the generation of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) as saliency maps using these features. The different CAM locations correspond to the importance of the lesion region based on their saliency. High-saliency regions in the map serve as pseudo-labels for lesion regions while low-saliency regions represent the background. However, intermediate regions can be hard to classify, often due to their proximity to lesion edges or interference from hair or blisters. Rather than risk potential pseudo-labeling errors or learning confusion by forcefully classifying these regions, we consider them as uncertainty regions, exempting them from pseudo-labeling and allowing the network to self-learn. Further, we employ connectivity detection and centrality detection to refine foreground pseudo-labels and reduce noise-induced errors. The application of cycle refining enhances performance further. Our method underwent thorough experimental validation on the ISIC-2017, ISIC-2018, and PH2 datasets, demonstrating that its performance is on par with weakly supervised and supervised methods, and exceeds that of other existing unsupervised methods",

    "title": "DA-STC: Domain Adaptive Video Semantic Segmentation via Spatio-Temporal Consistency",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces DroidBot-GPT, a tool that utilizes GPT-like large language models (LLMs) to automate the interactions with Android mobile applications. Given a natural language description of a desired task, DroidBot-GPT can automatically generate and execute actions that navigate the app to complete the task. It works by translating the app GUI state information and the available actions on the smartphone screen to natural language prompts and asking the LLM to make a choice of actions. Since the LLM is typically trained on a large amount of data including the how-to manuals of diverse software applications, it has the ability to make reasonable choices of actions based on the provided information. We evaluate DroidBot-GPT with a self-created dataset that contains 33 tasks collected from 17 Android applications spanning 10 categories. It can successfully complete 39.39% of the tasks, and the average partial completion progress is about 66.76%. Given the fact that our method is fully unsupervised (no modification required from both the app and the LLM), we believe there is great potential to enhance automation performance with better app development paradigms and/or custom model training",

    "abstract": "Optical Intraoral Scanners (IOS) are widely used in digital dentistry to provide detailed 3D information of dental crowns and the gingiva. Accurate 3D tooth segmentation in IOSs is critical for various dental applications, while previous methods are error-prone at complicated boundaries and exhibit unsatisfactory results across patients. In this paper, we propose TSegFormer which captures both local and global dependencies among different teeth and the gingiva in the IOS point clouds with a multi-task 3D transformer architecture. Moreover, we design a geometry-guided loss based on a novel point curvature to refine boundaries in an end-to-end manner, avoiding time-consuming post-processing to reach clinically applicable segmentation. In addition, we create a dataset with 16,000 IOSs, the largest ever IOS dataset to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate that our TSegFormer consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines. The superiority of TSegFormer is corroborated by extensive analysis, visualizations and real-world clinical applicability tests. Our code is available at https://github.com/huiminxiong/TSegFormer",

The discovery of adversarial examples provides an ideal solution to the security and usability trade-off by integrating adversarial examples and CAPTCHAs to generate adversarial CAPTCHAs that can fool the deep models. In this paper, we extend the definition of adversarial CAPTCHAs and propose a classification method for adversarial CAPTCHAs. Then we systematically review some commonly used methods to generate adversarial examples and methods that are successfully used to generate adversarial CAPTCHAs. Also, we analyze some defense methods that can be used to defend adversarial CAPTCHAs, indicating potential threats to adversarial CAPTCHAs.

However, LLMs are prone to hallucinate untruthful or nonsensical outputs that fail to meet user expectations in many real-world applications. Existing works for detecting hallucinations in LLMs either rely on external knowledge for reference retrieval or require sampling multiple responses from the LLM for consistency verification, making these methods costly and inefficient. In this paper, we propose a novel reference-free, uncertainty-based method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs. Our approach imitates human focus in factuality checking from three aspects: 1) focus on the most informative and important keywords in the given text; 2) focus on the unreliable tokens in historical context which may lead to a cascade of hallucinations; and 3) focus on the token properties such as token type and token frequency.

We demonstrate it with an example of a humanoid robot looking at the mirror and learning to detect the 3D pose of its own body from the image it perceives. To build our model, we first obtain features from the visual input and the postures of the robot's body via models prepared before the robot's operation. Then, we map their corresponding latent spaces by a sample-efficient robot's self-exploration at the mirror. In this way, the robot builds the solicited 3D pose detector, which quality is immediately perfect on the acquired samples instead of obtaining the quality gradually. The mapping, which employs associating the pairs of feature vectors, is then implemented in the same way as the key-value mechanism of the famous transformer models. Finally, deploying our model for imitation to a simulated robot allows us to study, tune up, and systematically evaluate its hyperparameters without the involvement of the human counterpart, advancing our previous research",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Achieving human-like planning and control with multimodal observations in an open world is a key milestone for more functional generalist agents. Existing approaches can handle certain long-horizon tasks in an open world. However, they still struggle when the number of open-world tasks could potentially be infinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as game time progresses. We introduce JARVIS-1, an open-world agent that can perceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions), generate sophisticated plans, and perform embodied control, all within the popular yet challenging open-world Minecraft universe. Specifically, we develop JARVIS-1 on top of pre-trained multimodal language models, which map visual observations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately dispatched to the goal-conditioned controllers. We outfit JARVIS-1 with a multimodal memory, which facilitates planning using both pre-trained knowledge and its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS-1 is the existing most general agent in Minecraft, capable of completing over 200 different tasks using control and observation space similar to humans. These tasks range from short-horizon tasks, e.g., \"chopping trees\" to long-horizon tasks, e.g., \"obtaining a diamond pickaxe\". JARVIS-1 performs exceptionally well in short-horizon tasks, achieving nearly perfect performance. In the classic long-term task of $\\texttt{ObtainDiamondPickaxe}$, JARVIS-1 surpasses the reliability of current state-of-the-art agents by 5 times and can successfully complete longer-horizon and more challenging tasks.

    "title": "Faithful Explanations of Black-box NLP Models Using LLM-generated Counterfactuals",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Causal explanations of the predictions of NLP systems are essential to ensure safety and establish trust. Yet, existing methods often fall short of explaining model predictions effectively or efficiently and are often model-specific. In this paper, we address model-agnostic explanations, proposing two approaches for counterfactual (CF) approximation. The first approach is CF generation, where a large language model (LLM) is prompted to change a specific text concept while keeping confounding concepts unchanged. While this approach is demonstrated to be very effective, applying LLM at inference-time is costly. We hence present a second approach based on matching, and propose a method that is guided by an LLM at training-time and learns a dedicated embedding space. This space is faithful to a given causal graph and effectively serves to identify matches that approximate CFs. After showing theoretically that approximating CFs is required in order to construct faithful explanations, we benchmark our approaches and explain several models, including LLMs with billions of parameters. Our empirical results demonstrate the excellent performance of CF generation models as model-agnostic explainers. Moreover, our matching approach, which requires far less test-time resources, also provides effective explanations, surpassing many baselines. We also find that Top-K techniques universally improve every tested method. Finally, we showcase the potential of LLMs in constructing new benchmarks for model explanation and subsequently validate our conclusions. Our work illuminates new pathways for efficient and accurate approaches to interpreting NLP systems",

    "abstract": "While the application of Artificial Intelligence in Finance has a long tradition, its potential in Entrepreneurship has been intensively explored only recently. In this context, Entrepreneurial Finance is a particularly fertile ground for future Artificial Intelligence proliferation. To support the latter, the study provides a bibliometric review of Artificial Intelligence applications in (1) entrepreneurial finance literature, and (2) corporate finance literature with implications for Entrepreneurship. Rigorous search and screening procedures of the scientific database Web of Science Core Collection resulted in the identification of 1890 relevant journal articles subjected to analysis. The bibliometric analysis gives a rich insight into the knowledge field's conceptual, intellectual, and social structure, indicating nascent and underdeveloped research directions. As far as we were able to identify, this is the first study to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic field concerning the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship, and Finance, and the first review that deals with Artificial Intelligence methods in Entrepreneurship. According to the results, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are highly represented in almost all identified topic niches. At the same time, applying Topic Modeling, Fuzzy Neural Network and Growing Hierarchical Self-organizing Map is quite rare. As an element of the research, and before final remarks, the article deals as well with a discussion of certain gaps in the relationship between Computer Science and Economics. These gaps do represent problems in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Economic Science.

Specifically, to discover meta-paths for various datasets or tasks without prior, we develop a search space with all target-node-related meta-paths. With a progressive sampling algorithm, we dynamically shrink the search space with hop-independent time complexity, leading to a compact search space driven by the current HIN and task. Utilizing a sampling evaluation strategy as the guidance, we conduct a specialized and expressive meta-path selection. Extensive experiments on eight heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that LMSPS discovers effective long-range meta-paths and outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG settings",

LLM-based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of LLMs, which enable them to autonomously break down the given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate the task execution to fulfill the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building LLM-based autonomous agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using autonomous agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as architecture design guidelines and enables responsible-AI-by-design when designing LLM-based autonomous agents.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

    "title": "SourceP: Detecting Ponzi Schemes on Ethereum with Source Code",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "As blockchain technology becomes more and more popular, a typical financial scam, the Ponzi scheme, has also emerged in the blockchain platform Ethereum. This Ponzi scheme deployed through smart contracts, also known as the smart Ponzi scheme, has caused a lot of economic losses and negative impacts. Existing methods for detecting smart Ponzi schemes on Ethereum mainly rely on bytecode features, opcode features, account features, and transaction behavior features of smart contracts, which are unable to truly characterize the behavioral features of Ponzi schemes, and thus generally perform poorly in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rates. In this paper, we propose SourceP, a method to detect smart Ponzi schemes on the Ethereum platform using pre-trained models and data flow, which only requires using the source code of smart contracts as features. SourceP reduces the difficulty of data acquisition and feature extraction of existing detection methods. Specifically, we first convert the source code of a smart contract into a data flow graph and then introduce a pre-trained model based on learning code representations to build a classification model to identify Ponzi schemes in smart contracts. The experimental results show that SourceP achieves 87.2\\% recall and 90.7\\% F-score for detecting smart Ponzi schemes within Ethereum's smart contract dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and sustainability. We also demonstrate through additional experiments that pre-trained models and data flow play an important contribution to SourceP, as well as proving that SourceP has a good generalization ability",

    "title": "Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models to Facilitate Legal Applications",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Language serves as a vehicle for conveying thought, enabling communication among individuals. The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts, identify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions fundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in logical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation methodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute to the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks while acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic",

    "title": "On the Limitation of Diffusion Models for Synthesizing Training Datasets",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

    "title": "Exploring and Characterizing Large Language Models For Embedded System Development and Debugging",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities to generate code, however their ability to develop software for embedded systems, which requires cross-domain knowledge of hardware and software has not been studied. In this paper we develop an extensible, open source hardware-in-the-loop framework to systematically evaluate leading LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, PaLM 2) to assess their capabilities and limitations for embedded system development. We observe through our study that even when these tools fail to produce working code, they consistently generate helpful reasoning about embedded design tasks. We leverage this finding to study how human programmers interact with these tools, and develop an human-AI based software engineering workflow for building embedded systems. Our evaluation platform for verifying LLM generated programs uses sensor actuator pairs for physical evaluation. We compare all three models with N=450 experiments and find surprisingly that GPT-4 especially shows an exceptional level of cross-domain understanding and reasoning, in some cases generating fully correct programs from a single prompt. In N=50 trials, GPT-4 produces functional I2C interfaces 66% of the time. GPT-4 also produces register-level drivers, code for LoRa communication, and context-specific power optimizations for an nRF52 program resulting in over 740x current reduction to 12.2uA. We also characterize the models' limitations to develop a generalizable human-AI workflow for using LLMs in embedded system development. We evaluate our workflow with 15 users including novice and expert programmers. We find that our workflow improves productivity for all users and increases the success rate for building a LoRa environmental sensor from 25% to 100%, including for users with zero hardware or C/C++ experience",

    "title": "From Classification to Clinical Insights: Towards Analyzing and Reasoning About Mobile and Behavioral Health Data With Large Language Models",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Passively collected behavioral health data from ubiquitous sensors holds significant promise to provide mental health professionals insights from patient's daily lives; however, developing analysis tools to use this data in clinical practice requires addressing challenges of generalization across devices and weak or ambiguous correlations between the measured signals and an individual's mental health. To address these challenges, we take a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to synthesize clinically useful insights from multi-sensor data. We develop chain of thought prompting methods that use LLMs to generate reasoning about how trends in data such as step count and sleep relate to conditions like depression and anxiety. We first demonstrate binary depression classification with LLMs achieving accuracies of 61.1% which exceed the state of the art. While it is not robust for clinical use, this leads us to our key finding: even more impactful and valued than classification is a new human-AI collaboration approach in which clinician experts interactively query these tools and combine their domain expertise and context about the patient with AI generated reasoning to support clinical decision-making. We find models like GPT-4 correctly reference numerical data 75% of the time, and clinician participants express strong interest in using this approach to interpret self-tracking data",

    "abstract": "Geographic privacy, a crucial aspect of personal security, often goes unnoticed in daily activities. This paper addresses the underestimation of this privacy in the context of increasing online data sharing and the advancements in information gathering technologies. With the surge in the use of Large Multimodal Models, such as GPT-4, for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the potential risks associated with geographic privacy breaches have intensified. This study highlights the criticality of these developments, focusing on their implications for individual privacy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced AI tools, specifically a GPT-4 based model named \"Dr. Watson,\" in identifying and potentially compromising geographic privacy through online shared content. We developed \"Dr. Watson\" to analyze and extract geographic information from publicly available data sources. The study involved five experimental cases, each offering different perspectives on the tool's application in extracting precise location data from partial images and social media content. The experiments revealed that \"Dr. Watson\" could successfully identify specific geographic details, thereby exposing the vulnerabilities in current geo-privacy measures. These findings underscore the ease with which geographic information can be unintentionally disclosed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader implications of these findings for individuals and the community at large. It emphasizes the urgency for enhanced awareness and protective measures against geo-privacy leakage in the era of advanced AI and widespread social media usage",

    "title": "RLIF: Interactive Imitation Learning as Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Although reinforcement learning methods offer a powerful framework for automatic skill acquisition, for practical learning-based control problems in domains such as robotics, imitation learning often provides a more convenient and accessible alternative. In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict na\\\"ive behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals themselves as rewards. This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imitation learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert. We also provide a unified framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non-asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method. We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Scoring student-drawn models is time-consuming. Recently released GPT-4V provides a unique opportunity to advance scientific modeling practices by leveraging the powerful image processing capability. To test this ability specifically for automatic scoring, we developed a method NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubric Instruction for Few-shot Learning) employing instructional note and rubrics to prompt GPT-4V to score students' drawn models for science phenomena. We randomly selected a set of balanced data (N = 900) that includes student-drawn models for six modeling assessment tasks. Each model received a score from GPT-4V ranging at three levels: 'Beginning,' 'Developing,' or 'Proficient' according to scoring rubrics. GPT-4V scores were compared with human experts' scores to calculate scoring accuracy. Results show that GPT-4V's average scoring accuracy was mean =.51, SD = .037. Specifically, average scoring accuracy was .64 for the 'Beginning' class, .62 for the 'Developing' class, and .26 for the 'Proficient' class, indicating that more proficient models are more challenging to score. Further qualitative study reveals how GPT-4V retrieves information from image input, including problem context, example evaluations provided by human coders, and students' drawing models. We also uncovered how GPT-4V catches the characteristics of student-drawn models and narrates them in natural language. At last, we demonstrated how GPT-4V assigns scores to student-drawn models according to the given scoring rubric and instructional notes. Our findings suggest that the NERIF is an effective approach for employing GPT-4V to score drawn models. Even though there is space for GPT-4V to improve scoring accuracy, some mis-assigned scores seemed interpretable to experts. The results of this study show that utilizing GPT-4V for automatic scoring of student-drawn models is promising",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Same-Day Delivery (SDD) services aim to maximize the fulfillment of online orders while minimizing delivery delays but are beset by operational uncertainties such as those in order volumes and courier planning. Our work aims to enhance the operational efficiency of SDD by focusing on the ultra-fast Order Dispatching Problem (ODP), which involves matching and dispatching orders to couriers within a centralized warehouse setting, and completing the delivery within a strict timeline (e.g., within minutes). We introduce important extensions to ultra-fast ODP such as order batching and explicit courier assignments to provide a more realistic representation of dispatching operations and improve delivery efficiency. As a solution method, we primarily focus on NeurADP, a methodology that combines Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and our work constitutes the first application of NeurADP outside of the ride-pool matching problem. NeurADP is particularly suitable for ultra-fast ODP as it addresses complex one-to-many matching and routing intricacies through a neural network-based VFA that captures high-dimensional problem dynamics without requiring manual feature engineering as in generic ADP methods. We test our proposed approach using four distinct realistic datasets tailored for ODP and compare the performance of NeurADP against myopic and DRL baselines by also making use of non-trivial bounds to assess the quality of the policies. Our numerical results indicate that the inclusion of order batching and courier queues enhances the efficiency of delivery operations and that NeurADP significantly outperforms other methods. Detailed sensitivity analysis with important parameters confirms the robustness of NeurADP under different scenarios, including variations in courier numbers, spatial setup, vehicle capacity, and permitted delay time",

In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs' reasoning abilities. Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning to replicate the output of more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on imitation may restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to employ different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used by the larger model. For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to a complex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer, etc.). More crucially, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36,000 unique prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance levels similar or better to those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings. make Orca 2 weights publicly available at aka.ms/orca-lm to support research on the development, evaluation, and alignment of smaller LMs",

The complex nature of healthcare workflows, intricacies in managing large and secure medical imaging data, and the absence of standardized frameworks for AI development pose significant barriers and require a new paradigm to address them. The role of interoperability is examined in this paper as a crucial factor in connecting disparate applications within healthcare workflows. Standards such as DICOM, Health Level 7 (HL7), and Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) are highlighted as foundational for common imaging workflows. A specific focus is placed on the role of DICOM gateways, with Smart Routing Rules and Workflow Management leading transformational efforts in this area. To drive enterprise scalability, new tools are needed. Project MONAI, established in 2019, is introduced as an initiative aiming to redefine the development of medical AI applications. The MONAI Deploy App SDK, a component of Project MONAI, is identified as a key tool in simplifying the packaging and deployment process, enabling repeatable, scalable, and standardized deployment patterns for AI applications.

Our work includes the presentation of a publicly available dataset called FarsTypo, which comprises 3.4 million words arranged in chronological order and tagged with their corresponding part-of-speech. These words cover a wide range of topics and linguistic styles. We develop an algorithm designed to apply Persian-specific errors to a scalable portion of these words, resulting in a parallel dataset of correct and incorrect words. By leveraging FarsTypo, we establish a strong foundation and conduct a thorough comparison of various methodologies employing different architectures. Additionally, we introduce a groundbreaking Deep Sequential Neural Network that utilizes both word and character embeddings, along with bidirectional LSTM layers, for token classification aimed at detecting typographical errors across 51 distinct classes. Our approach is contrasted with highly advanced industrial systems that, unlike this study, have been developed using a diverse range of resources. The outcomes of our final method proved to be highly competitive, achieving an accuracy of 97.62%, precision of 98.83%, recall of 98.61%, and surpassing others in terms of speed",

    "title": "Intrinsic Image Decomposition via Ordinal Shading",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Intrinsic decomposition is a fundamental mid-level vision problem that plays a crucial role in various inverse rendering and computational photography pipelines. Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world applicability of our estimations by performing otherwise difficult editing tasks such as recoloring and relighting",

    "title": "SPOT! Revisiting Video-Language Models for Event Understanding",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding",

    "title": "Digital Twin Framework for Optimal and Autonomous Decision-Making in Cyber-Physical Systems: Enhancing Reliability and Adaptability in the Oil and Gas Industry",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The concept of creating a virtual copy of a complete Cyber-Physical System opens up numerous possibilities, including real-time assessments of the physical environment and continuous learning from the system to provide reliable and precise information. This process, known as the twinning process or the development of a digital twin (DT), has been widely adopted across various industries. However, challenges arise when considering the computational demands of implementing AI models, such as those employed in digital twins, in real-time information exchange scenarios. This work proposes a digital twin framework for optimal and autonomous decision-making applied to a gas-lift process in the oil and gas industry, focusing on enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the DT. The framework combines Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo simulations, transfer learning, online learning, and novel strategies to confer cognition to the DT, including model hyperdimensional reduction and cognitive tack. Consequently, creating a framework for efficient, reliable, and trustworthy DT identification was possible. The proposed approach addresses the current gap in the literature regarding integrating various learning techniques and uncertainty management in digital twin strategies. This digital twin framework aims to provide a reliable and efficient system capable of adapting to changing environments and incorporating prediction uncertainty, thus enhancing the overall decision-making process in complex, real-world scenarios. Additionally, this work lays the foundation for further developments in digital twins for process systems engineering, potentially fostering new advancements and applications across various industrial sectors",

    "abstract": "Standardized, validated questionnaires are vital tools in HCI research and healthcare, offering dependable self-report data. However, their repeated use in longitudinal or pre-post studies can induce respondent fatigue, impacting data quality via response biases and decreased response rates. We propose utilizing large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse questionnaire versions while retaining good psychometric properties. In a longitudinal study, participants engaged with our agent system and responded daily for two weeks to either a standardized depression questionnaire or one of two LLM-generated questionnaire variants, alongside a validated depression questionnaire. Psychometric testing revealed consistent covariation between the external criterion and the focal measure administered across the three conditions, demonstrating the reliability and validity of the LLM-generated variants. Participants found the repeated administration of the standardized questionnaire significantly more repetitive compared to the variants. Our findings highlight the potential of LLM-generated variants to invigorate questionnaires, fostering engagement and interest without compromising validity",

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on five misinformation detection datasets show that LLMs with diverse prompts achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Besides, we further design four instruction-tuned strategies to enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection. These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple instances or hard instances, and eliminate irrelevant propagation structures, thereby achieving better detection performance. Extensive experiments further demonstrate LLMs would play a better capacity in content and propagation structure under these proposed strategies and achieve promising detection performance.

    "title": "From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Engineering Design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision language models, such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. In light of these advancements, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V, a vision language model, across a wide spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Our study assesses GPT-4V's capabilities in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, concept selection using Pugh Charts, material selection, engineering drawing analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, design for additive and subtractive manufacturing, spatial reasoning challenges, and textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore GPT-4V's proficiency in handling complex design and manufacturing challenges but also identify its limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models, emphasizing their immense potential for innovating and enhancing the engineering design and manufacturing landscape. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field",

    "title": "Mobile-Seed: Joint Semantic Segmentation and Boundary Detection for Mobile Robots",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our method's generalizability.

    "abstract": "Within the multimodal field, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress due to their strong perception and reasoning capabilities in the visual and language systems. However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

Two different schemes are presented in this paper, including the supervised and unsupervised learning schemes. With the data set generated by the method of moments (MoM), supervised NeuralBIM are trained with the knowledge of total fields and contrasts.

    "abstract": "Starting with early successes in computer vision tasks, deep learning based techniques have since overtaken state of the art approaches in a multitude of domains. However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

The situation can be further complicated when certain pieces of evidence contradict each other or become paradoxical. The primary challenge is how to determine which information can be trusted when we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for decision-making. This issue is known as deciding what to decide or Trustworthy AI. However, the AI system itself is often considered an opaque black box. We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI) encompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss function, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI properties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim to use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and qualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making context. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model trained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of credit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector.

    "title": "Multi-Session Budget Optimization for Forward Auction-based Federated Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as an important research field in recent years. The prevailing strategies for FL model users (MUs) assume that the entire team of the required data owners (DOs) for an FL task must be assembled before training can commence. In practice, an MU can trigger the FL training process multiple times. DOs can thus be gradually recruited over multiple FL model training sessions. Existing bidding strategies for AFL MUs are not designed to handle such scenarios. Therefore, the problem of multi-session AFL remains open. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-session Budget Optimization Strategy for forward Auction-based Federated Learning (MultiBOS-AFL). Based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, MultiBOS-AFL jointly optimizes inter-session budget pacing and intra-session bidding for AFL MUs, with the objective of maximizing the total utility. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that it significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches. On average, MultiBOS-AFL achieves 12.28% higher utility, 14.52% more data acquired through auctions for a given budget, and 1.23% higher test accuracy achieved by the resulting FL model compared to the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first budget optimization decision support method with budget pacing capability designed for MUs in multi-session forward auction-based federated learning",

    "abstract": "Data is one of the most critical elements in building a large language model. However, existing systems either fail to customize a corpus curation pipeline or neglect to leverage comprehensive corpus assessment for iterative optimization of the curation. To this end, we present a pretraining corpus curation and assessment platform called Oasis -- a one-stop system for data quality improvement and quantification with user-friendly interactive interfaces. Specifically, the interactive modular rule filter module can devise customized rules according to explicit feedback. The debiased neural filter module builds the quality classification dataset in a negative-centric manner to remove the undesired bias. The adaptive document deduplication module could execute large-scale deduplication with limited memory resources. These three parts constitute the customized data curation module. And in the holistic data assessment module, a corpus can be assessed in local and global views, with three evaluation means including human, GPT-4, and heuristic metrics. We exhibit a complete process to use Oasis for the curation and assessment of pretraining data. In addition, an 800GB bilingual corpus curated by Oasis is publicly released",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various multi-modal tasks. Nevertheless, their performance in fine-grained image understanding tasks is still limited. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new framework to enhance the fine-grained image understanding abilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we present a new method for constructing the instruction tuning dataset at a low cost by leveraging annotations in existing datasets. A self-consistent bootstrapping method is also introduced to extend existing dense object annotations into high-quality referring-expression-bounding-box pairs. These methods enable the generation of high-quality instruction data which includes a wide range of fundamental abilities essential for fine-grained image perception. Moreover, we argue that the visual encoder should be tuned during instruction tuning to mitigate the gap between full image perception and fine-grained image perception. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method. For instance, our model exhibits a 5.2% accuracy improvement over Qwen-VL on GQA and surpasses the accuracy of Kosmos-2 by 24.7% on RefCOCO_val.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Image Schemas are repetitive cognitive patterns that influence the way we conceptualize and reason about various concepts present in speech. These patterns are deeply embedded within our cognitive processes and are reflected in our bodily expressions including gestures. Particularly, metaphoric gestures possess essential characteristics and semantic meanings that align with Image Schemas, to visually represent abstract concepts. The shape and form of gestures can convey abstract concepts, such as extending the forearm and hand or tracing a line with hand movements to visually represent the image schema of PATH. Previous behavior generation models have primarily focused on utilizing speech (acoustic features and text) to drive the generation model of virtual agents. They have not considered key semantic information as those carried by Image Schemas to effectively generate metaphoric gestures. To address this limitation, we introduce META4, a deep learning approach that generates metaphoric gestures from both speech and Image Schemas. Our approach has two primary goals: computing Image Schemas from input text to capture the underlying semantic and metaphorical meaning, and generating metaphoric gestures driven by speech and the computed image schemas. Our approach is the first method for generating speech driven metaphoric gestures while leveraging the potential of Image Schemas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of both speech and image schemas in modeling metaphoric gestures",

To address this issue, we propose a fine-grained partially spoofed audio detection method, namely Temporal Deepfake Location (TDL), which can effectively capture information of both features and locations. Specifically, our approach involves two novel parts: embedding similarity module and temporal convolution operation. To enhance the identification between the real and fake features, the embedding similarity module is designed to generate an embedding space that can separate the real frames from fake frames. To effectively concentrate on the position information, temporal convolution operation is proposed to calculate the frame-specific similarities among neighboring frames, and dynamically select informative neighbors to convolution.

    "title": "Unified Segment-to-Segment Framework for Simultaneous Sequence Generation",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Simultaneous sequence generation is a pivotal task for real-time scenarios, such as streaming speech recognition, simultaneous machine translation and simultaneous speech translation, where the target sequence is generated while receiving the source sequence. The crux of achieving high-quality generation with low latency lies in identifying the optimal moments for generating, accomplished by learning a mapping between the source and target sequences. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific heuristics for different sequence types, limiting the model's capacity to adaptively learn the source-target mapping and hindering the exploration of multi-task learning for various simultaneous tasks. In this paper, we propose a unified segment-to-segment framework (Seg2Seg) for simultaneous sequence generation, which learns the mapping in an adaptive and unified manner. During the process of simultaneous generation, the model alternates between waiting for a source segment and generating a target segment, making the segment serve as the natural bridge between the source and target. To accomplish this, Seg2Seg introduces a latent segment as the pivot between source to target and explores all potential source-target mappings via the proposed expectation training, thereby learning the optimal moments for generating. Experiments on multiple simultaneous generation tasks demonstrate that Seg2Seg achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits better generality across various tasks",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Computational design can excite the full potential of soft robotics that has the drawbacks of being highly nonlinear from material, structure, and contact. Up to date, enthusiastic research interests have been demonstrated for individual soft fingers, but the frame design space (how each soft finger is assembled) remains largely unexplored. Computationally design remains challenging for the finger-based soft gripper to grip across multiple geometrical-distinct object types successfully. Including the design space for the gripper frame can bring huge difficulties for conventional optimisation algorithms and fitness calculation methods due to the exponential growth of high-dimensional design space. This work proposes an automated computational design optimisation framework that generates gripper diversity to individually grasp geometrically distinct object types based on a quality-diversity approach. This work first discusses a significantly large design space (28 design parameters) for a finger-based soft gripper, including the rarely-explored design space of finger arrangement that is converted to various configurations to arrange individual soft fingers. Then, a contact-based Finite Element Modelling (FEM) is proposed in SOFA to output high-fidelity grasping data for fitness evaluation and feature measurements. Finally, diverse gripper designs are obtained from the framework while considering features such as the volume and workspace of grippers. This work bridges the gap of computationally exploring the vast design space of finger-based soft grippers while grasping large geometrically distinct object types with a simple control scheme",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning to perform multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks, with applications to cable routing, where the robot must route a cable through a series of clips. This setting presents challenges representative of complex multi-stage robotic manipulation scenarios: handling deformable objects, closing the loop on visual perception, and handling extended behaviors consisting of multiple steps that must be executed successfully to complete the entire task. In such settings, learning individual primitives for each stage that succeed with a high enough rate to perform a complete temporally extended task is impractical: if each stage must be completed successfully and has a non-negligible probability of failure, the likelihood of successful completion of the entire task becomes negligible. Therefore, successful controllers for such multi-stage tasks must be able to recover from failure and compensate for imperfections in low-level controllers by smartly choosing which controllers to trigger at any given time, retrying, or taking corrective action as needed. To this end, we describe an imitation learning system that uses vision-based policies trained from demonstrations at both the lower (motor control) and the upper (sequencing) level, present a system for instantiating this method to learn the cable routing task, and perform evaluations showing great performance in generalizing to very challenging clip placement variations.

In addition to this, a key challenge is to determine how to manipulate these relational data, which are often in the form of particular triples (i.e., subject, predicate, object), to enable the learning process. Currently, many high-quality catalogs of knowledge graphs, are available. However, their primary goal is the re-usability of these resources, and their interconnection, in the context of the Semantic Web. This paper describes the LiveSchema initiative, namely, a first version of a gateway that has the main scope of leveraging the gold mine of data collected by many existing catalogs collecting relational data like ontologies and knowledge graphs. At the current state, LiveSchema contains - 1000 datasets from 4 main sources and offers some key facilities, which allow to: i) evolving LiveSchema, by aggregating other source catalogs and repositories as input sources; ii) querying all the collected resources; iii) transforming each given dataset into formal concept analysis matrices that enable analysis and visualization services; iv) generating models and tensors from each given dataset",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM)-based speech synthesis has been widely adopted in zero-shot speech synthesis. However, they require a large-scale data and possess the same limitations as previous autoregressive speech models, including slow inference speed and lack of robustness. This paper proposes HierSpeech++, a fast and strong zero-shot speech synthesizer for text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). We verified that hierarchical speech synthesis frameworks could significantly improve the robustness and expressiveness of the synthetic speech. Furthermore, we significantly improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of synthetic speech even in zero-shot speech synthesis scenarios. For text-to-speech, we adopt the text-to-vec framework, which generates a self-supervised speech representation and an F0 representation based on text representations and prosody prompts. Then, HierSpeech++ generates speech from the generated vector, F0, and voice prompt. We further introduce a high-efficient speech super-resolution framework from 16 kHz to 48 kHz. The experimental results demonstrated that the hierarchical variational autoencoder could be a strong zero-shot speech synthesizer given that it outperforms LLM-based and diffusion-based models.

Specifically, our framework allows us to identify a time-independent policy that converges, if deployed, to the targeted fair stationary state of the system in the long term, independently of the initial data distribution. We model the system dynamics with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimize the policy leveraging the Markov chain convergence theorem to ensure unique convergence. We provide examples of different targeted fair states of the system, encompassing a range of long-term goals for society and policymakers. Furthermore, we show how our approach facilitates the evaluation of different long-term targets by examining their impact on the group-conditional population distribution in the long term and how it evolves until convergence",

Via semantic KB, source messages can be characterized in low-dimensional subspaces without compromising their desired meaning, thus significantly enhancing the communication efficiency. The fundamental principle of semantic KB is first introduced, and a generative semantic communication architecture is developed by presenting three sub-KBs, namely source, task, and channel KBs. Then, the detailed construction approaches for each sub-KB are described, followed by their utilization in terms of semantic coding and transmission. A case study is also provided to showcase the superiority of generative semantic communication over conventional syntactic communication and classical semantic communication.

We address this question by exploring how TRACX2, (French et al., 2011; French \\& Cottrell, 2014; Mareschal \\& French, 2017), a recognition-based, recursive connectionist autoencoder model of chunking and sequence segmentation, which has successfully simulated speech and serial-image processing, might be applied to elementary melody perception. The model, a three-layer autoencoder that recognizes ''chunks'' of short sequences of intervals that have been frequently encountered on input, is trained on the tone intervals of melodically simple French children's songs. It dynamically incorporates the internal representations of these chunks into new input. Its internal representations cluster in a manner that is consistent with ''human-recognizable'' melodic categories. TRACX2 is sensitive to both contour and proximity information in the musical chunks that it encounters in its input. It shows the ''end-of-word'' superiority effect demonstrated by Saffran et al.

The overall findings suggest that the recursive autoassociative chunking mechanism, as implemented in TRACX2, may be a general segmentation and chunking mechanism, underlying not only word-and imagechunking, but also elementary melody processing",

We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Case studies commonly form the pedagogical backbone in law, ethics, and many other domains that face complex and ambiguous societal questions informed by human values. Similar complexities and ambiguities arise when we consider how AI should be aligned in practice: when faced with vast quantities of diverse (and sometimes conflicting) values from different individuals and communities, with whose values is AI to align, and how should AI do so? We propose a complementary approach to constitutional AI alignment, grounded in ideas from case-based reasoning (CBR), that focuses on the construction of policies through judgments on a set of cases. We present a process to assemble such a case repository by: 1) gathering a set of ``seed'' cases -- questions one may ask an AI system -- in a particular domain from discussions in online communities, 2) eliciting domain-specific key dimensions for cases through workshops with domain experts, 3) using LLMs to generate variations of cases not seen in the wild, and 4) engaging with the public to judge and improve cases. We then discuss how such a case repository could assist in AI alignment, both through directly acting as precedents to ground acceptable behaviors, and as a medium for individuals and communities to engage in moral reasoning around AI",

    "title": "Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a ``sink'' even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm",

    "title": "Do Smaller Language Models Answer Contextualised Questions Through Memorisation Or Generalisation?",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "A distinction is often drawn between a model's ability to predict a label for an evaluation sample that is directly memorised from highly similar training samples versus an ability to predict the label via some method of generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering, discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two additional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart simple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on some of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is performance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of the evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional training datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of our evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and 25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change in performance",

Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors to apply in LLM driving systems. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation in this field.

Moreover, we summarized the works in The 1st WACV Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD), which is the first workshop of its kind regarding LLMs in autonomous driving.

Leveraging deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis. However, developing a reliable model generally necessitates substantial data for training, which is challenging in pathological field. In response, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance. Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and supportable for further pathology-related research",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In the fundamental statistics course, students are taught to remember the well-known saying: \"Correlation is not Causation\". Till now, statistics (i.e., correlation) have developed various successful frameworks, such as Transformer and Pre-training large-scale models, which have stacked multiple parallel self-attention blocks to imitate a wide range of tasks. However, in the causation community, how to build an integrated causal framework still remains an untouched domain despite its excellent intervention capabilities. In this paper, we propose the Causal Graph Routing (CGR) framework, an integrated causal scheme relying entirely on the intervention mechanisms to reveal the cause-effect forces hidden in data. Specifically, CGR is composed of a stack of causal layers. Each layer includes a set of parallel deconfounding blocks from different causal graphs. We combine these blocks via the concept of the proposed sufficient cause, which allows the model to dynamically select the suitable deconfounding methods in each layer. CGR is implemented as the stacked networks, integrating no confounder, back-door adjustment, front-door adjustment, and probability of sufficient cause. We evaluate this framework on two classical tasks of CV and NLP. Experiments show CGR can surpass the current state-of-the-art methods on both Visual Question Answer and Long Document Classification tasks. In particular, CGR has great potential in building the \"causal\" pre-training large-scale model that effectively generalizes to diverse tasks. It will improve the machines' comprehension of causal relationships within a broader semantic space",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In recent years, short Text Matching tasks have been widely applied in the fields ofadvertising search and recommendation. The difficulty lies in the lack of semantic information and word ambiguity caused by the short length of the text. Previous works have introduced complement sentences or knowledge bases to provide additional feature information. However, these methods have not fully interacted between the original sentence and the complement sentence, and have not considered the noise issue that may arise from the introduction of external knowledge bases. Therefore, this paper proposes a short Text Matching model that combines contrastive learning and external knowledge. The model uses a generative model to generate corresponding complement sentences and uses the contrastive learning method to guide the model to obtain more semantically meaningful encoding of the original sentence. In addition, to avoid noise, we use keywords as the main semantics of the original sentence to retrieve corresponding knowledge words in the knowledge base, and construct a knowledge graph. The graph encoding model is used to integrate the knowledge base information into the model. Our designed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available Chinese Text Matching datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model",

    "abstract": "The overarching objective of this paper is two-fold. First, to explore model-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the RE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards the first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis of TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from the instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the second objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to automatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and reannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is based on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used false-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our second approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean subset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally, we retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset. Our empirical results based on two SOTA models trained on TACRED-E following the IS show an average 4% F1-score improvement, whereas reannotation (TACRED-R) does not improve the original results. However, following ES, SOTA models show the average F1-score improvement of 3.8% and 4.4% when trained on respective eliminated (TACRED-EN) and reannotated (TACRED-RN) datasets respectively. We further extended the ES for cleaning positive examples as well, which resulted in an average performance improvement of 5.8% and 5.6% for the eliminated (TACRED-ENP) and reannotated (TACRED-RNP) datasets respectively",

    "abstract": "Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship, etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g., Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that include science question-answering and scientific document classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy",

However, existing causal abstraction methods have two major limitations: they require a brute-force search over alignments between the high-level model and the low-level one, and they presuppose that variables in the high-level model will align with disjoint sets of neurons in the low-level one. In this paper, we present distributed alignment search (DAS), which overcomes these limitations. In DAS, we find the alignment between high-level and low-level models using gradient descent rather than conducting a brute-force search, and we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles by analyzing representations in non-standard bases-distributed representations. Our experiments show that DAS can discover internal structure that prior approaches miss. Overall, DAS removes previous obstacles to conducting causal abstraction analyses and allows us to find conceptual structure in trained neural nets",

In this work, we present NeuroPrompts, an adaptive framework that automatically enhances a user's prompt to improve the quality of generations produced by text-to-image models. Our framework utilizes constrained text decoding with a pre-trained language model that has been adapted to generate prompts similar to those produced by human prompt engineers. This approach enables higher-quality text-to-image generations and provides user control over stylistic features via constraint set specification.

    "title": "Digital Twin-Based User-Centric Edge Continual Learning in Integrated Sensing and Communication",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based user-centric approach for processing sensing data in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with high accuracy and efficient resource utilization. The considered scenario involves an ISAC device with a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) and a mobile edge computing (MEC) server with a large DNN. After collecting sensing data, the ISAC device either processes the data locally or uploads them to the server for higher-accuracy data processing. To cope with data drifts, the server updates the lightweight DNN when necessary, referred to as continual learning. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average computation cost of the MEC server by optimizing two decisions, i.e., sensing data offloading and sensing data selection for the DNN update. A DT of the ISAC device is constructed to predict the impact of potential decisions on the long-term computation cost of the server, based on which the decisions are made with closed-form formulas. Experiments on executing DNN-based human motion recognition tasks are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed DT-based approach in computation cost minimization",

In particular, we ask ChatGPT to give examples of how to use Bayes rule for medical diagnosis. Our prompts range from queries that use terminology from pure probability (e.g., requests for a \"posterior probability\") to queries that use terminology from the medical diagnosis literature (e.g., requests for a \"post-test probability\"). We show how the introduction of medical variable names leads to an increase in the number of errors that ChatGPT makes. Given our results, we also show how one can use prompt engineering to facilitate ChatGPT's partial avoidance of these errors.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Trust in robots is widely believed to be imperative for the adoption of robots into people's daily lives. It is, therefore, understandable that the literature of the last few decades focuses on measuring how much people trust robots -- and more generally, any agent - to foster such trust in these technologies. Researchers have been exploring how people trust robot in different ways, such as measuring trust on human-robot interactions (HRI) based on textual descriptions or images without any physical contact, during and after interacting with the technology. Nevertheless, trust is a complex behaviour, and it is affected and depends on several factors, including those related to the interacting agents (e.g. humans, robots, pets), itself (e.g. capabilities, reliability), the context (e.g. task), and the environment (e.g. public spaces vs private spaces vs working spaces). In general, most roboticists agree that insufficient levels of trust lead to a risk of disengagement while over-trust in technology can cause over-reliance and inherit dangers, for example, in emergency situations. It is, therefore, very important that the research community has access to reliable methods to measure people's trust in robots and technology. In this position paper, we outline current methods and their strengths, identify (some) weakly covered aspects and discuss the potential for covering a more comprehensive amount of factors influencing trust in HRI",

Chatbots, for instance, lack situational awareness on the digital platforms where they operate, preventing them from enacting meaningful and autonomous intelligent behavior similar to human users.

We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by denoised relative positional encoding.

    "title": "Guinea Pig Trials\" Utilizing GPT: A Novel Smart Agent-Based Modeling Approach for Studying Firm Competition and Collusion",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Firm competition and collusion involve complex dynamics, particularly when considering communication among firms. Such issues can be modeled as problems of complex systems, traditionally approached through experiments involving human subjects or agent-based modeling methods. We propose an innovative framework called Smart Agent-Based Modeling (SABM), wherein smart agents, supported by GPT-4 technologies, represent firms, and interact with one another. We conducted a controlled experiment to study firm price competition and collusion behaviors under various conditions. SABM is more cost-effective and flexible compared to conducting experiments with human subjects. Smart agents possess an extensive knowledge base for decision-making and exhibit human-like strategic abilities, surpassing traditional ABM agents. Furthermore, smart agents can simulate human conversation and be personalized, making them ideal for studying complex situations involving communication. Our results demonstrate that, in the absence of communication, smart agents consistently reach tacit collusion, leading to prices converging at levels higher than the Bertrand equilibrium price but lower than monopoly or cartel prices. When communication is allowed, smart agents achieve a higher-level collusion with prices close to cartel prices. Collusion forms more quickly with communication, while price convergence is smoother without it. These results indicate that communication enhances trust between firms, encouraging frequent small price deviations to explore opportunities for a higher-level win-win situation and reducing the likelihood of triggering a price war. We also assigned different personas to firms to analyze behavioral differences and tested variant models under diverse market structures. The findings showcase the effectiveness and robustness of SABM and provide intriguing insights into competition and collusion",

However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment. This work takes a step towards understanding visual behavior of dogs and their interaction with the physical world",

Notably, GPT-4-Turbo used with a retrieval system incorrectly answered or refused to answer 81% of questions.

Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically risen since the early 1900s with U.S. transportation generating 28% of the U.S' emissions. As such, there is interest in reducing transportation-related emissions. Specifically, sustainability research has sprouted around signalized intersections as intersections allow different streams of traffic to cross and change directions. Recent research has developed mixed traffic control eco-driving strategies at signalized intersections to decrease emissions. However, the inherent structure of a signalized intersection generates increased emissions by creating frequent acceleration/deceleration events, excessive idling from traffic congestion, and stop-and-go waves. Thus, we believe unsignalized intersections hold potential for further sustainability improvements. In this work, we provide an emissions analysis on unsignalized intersections with complex, real-world topologies and traffic demands where mixed traffic control strategies are employed by robot vehicles (RVs) to reduce waiting times and congestion. We find with at least 10% RV penetration rate, RVs generate less fuel consumption and NOx emissions than signalized intersections by up to 27% and 28%, respectively. With at least 30% RVs, CO and HC emissions are reduced by up to 42% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, RVs can reduce emissions across the whole network despite only employing their strategies at the intersections",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "MRI scans provide valuable medical information, however they also contain sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII) that needs to be protected. Whereas MRI metadata is easily sanitized, MRI image data is a privacy risk because it contains information to render highly-realistic 3D visualizations of a patient's head, enabling malicious actors to possibly identify the subject by cross-referencing a database. Data anonymization and de-identification is concerned with ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of individuals' personal information. Traditional MRI de-identification methods remove privacy-sensitive parts (e.g. eyes, nose etc.) from a given scan. This comes at the expense of introducing a domain shift that can throw off downstream analyses. Recently, a GAN-based approach was proposed to de-identify a patient's scan by remodeling it (\\eg changing the face) rather than by removing parts. In this work, we propose CP-MAE, a model that de-identifies the face using masked autoencoders and that outperforms all previous approaches in terms of downstream task performance as well as de-identification. With our method we are able to synthesize scans of resolution up to $256^3$ (previously $128^3$) which constitutes an eight-fold increase in the number of voxels. Using our construction we were able to design a system that exhibits a highly robust training stage, making it easy to fit the network on novel data",

Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin.

Graph-based methods have achieved considerable performance by capturing user-item interactions.

Here, we propose the concept of variational embeddings as a means of pre-training the recommender system to improve the feature propagation through the layers of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The graph variational embedding collaborative filtering (GVECF) is introduced as a novel framework to incorporate representations learned through a variational graph auto-encoder which are embedded into a GCN-based collaborative filtering. This approach effectively transforms latent high-order user-item interactions into more trainable vectors, ultimately resulting in better performance in terms of recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain(NDCG) metrics.

    "title": "Improving Real Estate Appraisal with POI Integration and Areal Embedding",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Despite advancements in real estate appraisal methods, this study primarily focuses on two pivotal challenges. Firstly, we explore the often-underestimated impact of Points of Interest (POI) on property values, emphasizing the necessity for a comprehensive, data-driven approach to feature selection. Secondly, we integrate road-network-based Areal Embedding to enhance spatial understanding for real estate appraisal. We first propose a revised method for POI feature extraction, and discuss the impact of each POI for house price appraisal. Then we present the Areal embedding-enabled Masked Multihead Attention-based Spatial Interpolation for House Price Prediction (AMMASI) model, an improvement upon the existing ASI model, which leverages masked multi-head attention on geographic neighbor houses and similar-featured houses. Our model outperforms current baselines and also offers promising avenues for future optimization in real estate appraisal methodologies",

Unlike existing work either struggle with high-resolution documents or give up the large language model thus vision or language ability constrained, our DocPedia directly processes visual input in the frequency domain rather than the pixel space. The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks. The results provide further evidence of the effectiveness and superior performance of our DocPedia over other methods",

    "abstract": "The application of routing algorithms to real-world situations is a widely studied research topic. Despite this, routing algorithms and applications are usually developed for a general purpose, meaning that certain groups, such as ageing people, are often marginalized due to the broad approach of the designed algorithms. This situation may pose a problem in cities which are suffering a slow but progressive ageing of their populations. With this motivation in mind, this paper focuses on describing our implemented Age-Friendly Route Planner, whose goal is to improve the experience in the city for senior citizens. In order to measure the age-friendliness of a route, several variables have been deemed, such as the number of amenities along the route, the amount of comfortable elements found, or the avoidance of sloppy sections. In this paper, we describe one of the main features of the Age-Friendly Route Planner: the preference-based routes, and we also demonstrate how it can contribute to the creation of adapted friendly routes",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

However, existing model architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet and ConvNeXt often underperform on smaller, specialised datasets typical of such projects. We address this gap with informed data collection and the development of a new CNN architecture, PhytNet. Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost (1.19 GFLOPS). As such PhytNet is a promising candidate for rapid disease or plant classification, or precise localisation of disease symptoms for autonomous systems",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Dynamic handwriting analysis, due to its non-invasive and readily accessible nature, has recently emerged as a vital adjunctive method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we design a compact and efficient network architecture to analyse the distinctive handwriting patterns of patients' dynamic handwriting signals, thereby providing an objective identification for the Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Methods: The proposed network is based on a hybrid deep learning approach that fully leverages the advantages of both long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the LSTM block is adopted to extract the time-varying features, while the CNN-based block is implemented using one-dimensional convolution for low computational cost. Moreover, the hybrid model architecture is continuously refined under ablation studies for superior performance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method with its generalization under a five-fold cross-validation, which validates its efficiency and robustness. Results: The proposed network demonstrates its versatility by achieving impressive classification accuracies on both our new DraWritePD dataset ($96.2\\%$) and the well-established PaHaW dataset ($90.7\\%$). Moreover, the network architecture also stands out for its excellent lightweight design, occupying a mere $0.084$M of parameters, with a total of only $0.59$M floating-point operations. It also exhibits near real-time CPU inference performance, with inference times ranging from $0.106$ to $0.220$s. Conclusions: We present a series of experiments with extensive analysis, which systematically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid neural network in extracting distinctive handwriting patterns for precise diagnosis of Parkinson's disease",

To address this gap, this paper presents a large-scale and fine-grained automotive dataset consisting of 84,162 images for detecting 12 different types of car parts. This dataset was collected from natural cameras and online websites which covers various car brands, scenarios, and shooting angles. To alleviate the burden of manual annotation, we propose a novel semi-supervised auto-labeling method that leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained detectors. Moreover, we study the limitations of the Grounding DINO approach for zero-shot labeling.

    "title": "Towards Robust Text Retrieval with Progressive Learning",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Retrieval augmentation has become an effective solution to empower large language models (LLMs) with external and verified knowledge sources from the database, which overcomes the limitations and hallucinations of LLMs in handling up-to-date and domain-specific information. However, existing embedding models for text retrieval usually have three non-negligible limitations. First, the number and diversity of samples in a batch are too restricted to supervise the modeling of textual nuances at scale. Second, the high proportional noise are detrimental to the semantic correctness and consistency of embeddings. Third, the equal treatment to easy and difficult samples would cause sub-optimum convergence of embeddings with poorer generalization. In this paper, we propose the PEG, a progressively learned embeddings for robust text retrieval. Specifically, we increase the training in-batch negative samples to 80,000, and for each query, we extracted five hard negatives. Concurrently, we incorporated a progressive learning mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically modulate its attention to the samples throughout the entire training process. Additionally, PEG is trained on more than 100 million data, encompassing a wide range of domains (e.g., finance, medicine, and tourism) and covering various tasks (e.g., question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and similarity matching). Extensive experiments conducted on C-MTEB and DuReader demonstrate that PEG surpasses state-of-the-art embeddings in retrieving true positives, highlighting its significant potential for applications in LLMs. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/TownsWu/PEG",

    "abstract": "A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is pivotal for deciphering complex relationships. Causal Structure Learning (CSL), which focuses on deriving causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from data, faces challenges due to vast DAG spaces and data sparsity. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), recognized for their causal reasoning capabilities, offers a promising direction to enhance CSL by infusing it with knowledge-based causal inferences. However, existing approaches utilizing LLMs for CSL have encountered issues, including unreliable constraints from imperfect LLM inferences and the computational intensity of full pairwise variable analyses. In response, we introduce the Iterative LLM Supervised CSL (ILS-CSL) framework. ILS-CSL innovatively integrates LLM-based causal inference with CSL in an iterative process, refining the causal DAG using feedback from LLMs. This method not only utilizes LLM resources more efficiently but also generates more robust and high-quality structural constraints compared to previous methodologies. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight real-world datasets demonstrates ILS-CSL's superior performance, setting a new standard in CSL efficacy and showcasing its potential to significantly advance the field of causal discovery.

Most of them generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three levels: frames, channels, and locations.

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods",

    "abstract": "The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge. However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering news timeline generation practical for professional use.

In this paper, we propose an environment-aware affordance framework that incorporates both object-level actionable priors and environment constraints. Unlike object-centric affordance approaches, learning environment-aware affordance faces the challenge of combinatorial explosion due to the complexity of various occlusions, characterized by their quantities, geometries, positions and poses. To address this and enhance data efficiency, we introduce a novel contrastive affordance learning framework capable of training on scenes containing a single occluder and generalizing to scenes with complex occluder combinations. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in learning affordance considering environment constraints. Project page at https://chengkaiacademycity.github.io/EnvAwareAfford/",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The application of LLMs to specific domains, such as biomedicine, has achieved increased attention. However, most biomedical LLMs focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation tasks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the LLMs on diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, we present Taiyi, a bilingual (English and Chinese) fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. In this work, we first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text mining datasets across over 10 task types. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification, question answering tasks demonstrate Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyi's considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Embedded devices are specialised devices designed for one or only a few purposes. They are often part of a larger system, through wired or wireless connection. Those embedded devices that are connected to other computers or embedded systems through the Internet are called Internet of Things (IoT for short) devices. With their widespread usage and their insufficient protection, these devices are increasingly becoming the target of malware attacks. Companies often cut corners to save manufacturing costs or misconfigure when producing these devices. This can be lack of software updates, ports left open or security defects by design. Although these devices may not be as powerful as a regular computer, their large number makes them suitable candidates for botnets. Other types of IoT devices can even cause health problems since there are even pacemakers connected to the Internet. This means, that without sufficient defence, even directed assaults are possible against people. The goal of this thesis project is to provide better security for these devices with the help of machine learning algorithms and reverse engineering tools. Specifically, I study the applicability of control-flow related data of executables for malware detection. I present a malware detection method with two phases. The first phase extracts control-flow related data using static binary analysis. The second phase classifies binary executables as either malicious or benign using a neural network model. I train the model using a dataset of malicious and benign ARM applications",

    "title": "Fuzzy order-sorted feature logic",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Order-Sorted Feature (OSF) logic is a knowledge representation and reasoning language based on function-denoting feature symbols and set-denoting sort symbols ordered in a subsumption lattice. OSF logic allows the construction of record-like terms that represent classes of entities and that are themselves ordered in a subsumption relation. The unification algorithm for such structures provides an efficient calculus of type subsumption, which has been applied in computational linguistics and implemented in constraint logic programming languages such as LOGIN and LIFE and automated reasoners such as CEDAR. This work generalizes OSF logic to a fuzzy setting. We give a flexible definition of a fuzzy subsumption relation which generalizes Zadeh's inclusion between fuzzy sets. Based on this definition we define a fuzzy semantics of OSF logic where sort symbols and OSF terms denote fuzzy sets. We extend the subsumption relation to OSF terms and prove that it constitutes a fuzzy partial order with the property that two OSF terms are subsumed by one another in the crisp sense if and only if their subsumption degree is greater than 0. We show how to find the greatest lower bound of two OSF terms by unifying them and how to compute the subsumption degree between two OSF terms, and we provide the complexity of these operations",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Semantic communication serves as a novel paradigm and attracts the broad interest of researchers. One critical aspect of it is the multi-user semantic communication theory, which can further promote its application to the practical network environment. While most existing works focused on the design of end-to-end single-user semantic transmission, a novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based multi-user semantic communication system named NOMASC is proposed in this paper. The proposed system can support semantic tranmission of multiple users with diverse modalities of source information. To avoid high demand for hardware, an asymmetric quantizer is employed at the end of the semantic encoder for discretizing the continuous full-resolution semantic feature. In addition, a neural network model is proposed for mapping the discrete feature into self-learned symbols and accomplishing intelligent multi-user detection (MUD) at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system holds good performance in non-orthogonal transmission of multiple user signals and outperforms the other methods, especially at low-to-medium SNRs. Moreover, it has high robustness under various simulation settings and mismatched test scenarios",

    "title": "Advancing Urban Renewal: An Automated Approach to Generating Historical Arcade Facades with Stable Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD), an efficient method for addressing the severe data-hungry problem, has been extensively discussed. Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. Our results indicate that our proposed module could achieve stable improvements of 5% to 10% in both fine-tuning and meta-learning paradigms and has outperformed the highest score in recent works",

Labor Space exposes the complex relational fabric of various labor market constituents, facilitating coherent integrative analysis of industries, occupations, skills, and firms, while retaining type-specific clustering. We demonstrate its unprecedented analytical capacities, including positioning heterogeneous entities on an economic axes, such as `Manufacturing--Healthcare'. Furthermore, by allowing vector arithmetic of these entities, Labor Space enables the exploration of complex inter-unit relations, and subsequently the estimation of the ramifications of economic shocks on individual units and their ripple effect across the labor market. We posit that Labor Space provides policymakers and business leaders with a comprehensive unifying framework for labor market analysis and simulation, fostering more nuanced and effective strategic decision-making",

    "abstract": "Context and motivation: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Their application in Requirements Engineering (RE), especially in requirements classification, has gained increasing interest. Question/problem: In our research, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of ChatGPT models including text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4 in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for requirements classification. The question arises as to how these models compare to traditional classification methods, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Principal ideas/results: Based on five diverse datasets, our results show that ChatGPT consistently outperforms LSTM, and while ChatGPT is more effective than SVM in classifying functional requirements (FR), SVM is better in classifying non-functional requirements (NFR). Our results also show that contrary to our expectations, the few-shot setting does not always lead to enhanced performance; in most instances, it was found to be suboptimal. Contribution: Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in the RE domain, suggesting that they could play a pivotal role in future software engineering processes, particularly as tools to enhance requirements classification",

Recent progress in text-guided image synthesis has yielded models with an impressive ability to generate complex novel images, exhibiting combinatorial generalization across domains.

Specifically, we cast the sequential decision making problem as a text-conditioned video generation problem, where, given a text-encoded specification of a desired goal, a planner synthesizes a set of future frames depicting its planned actions in the future, after which control actions are extracted from the generated video. By leveraging text as the underlying goal specification, we are able to naturally and combinatorially generalize to novel goals. The proposed policy-as-video formulation can further represent environments with different state and action spaces in a unified space of images, which, for example, enables learning and generalization across a variety of robot manipulation tasks. Finally, by leveraging pretrained language embeddings and widely available videos from the internet, the approach enables knowledge transfer through predicting highly realistic video plans for real robots",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Our focus is on projects, i.e., business processes, which are emerging as the economic drivers of our times. Differently from day-to-day operational processes that do not require detailed planning, a project requires planning and resource-constrained scheduling for coordinating resources across sub- or related projects and organizations. A planner in charge of project planning has to select a set of activities to perform, determine their precedence constraints, and schedule them according to temporal project constraints. We suggest a data-driven project planning approach for classes of projects such as infrastructure building and information systems development projects. A project network is first learned from historical records. The discovered network relaxes temporal constraints embedded in individual projects, thus uncovering where planning and scheduling flexibility can be exploited for greater benefit. Then, the network, which contains multiple project plan variations, from which one has to be selected, is enriched by identifying decision rules and frequent paths. The planner can rely on the project network for: 1) decoding a project variation such that it forms a new project plan, and 2) applying resource-constrained project scheduling procedures to determine the project's schedule and resource allocation. Using two real-world project datasets, we show that the suggested approach may provide the planner with significant flexibility (up to a 26% reduction of the critical path of a real project) to adjust the project plan and schedule. We believe that the proposed approach can play an important part in supporting decision making towards automated data-driven project planning",

    "title": "BOURNE: Bootstrapped Self-supervised Learning Framework for Unified Graph Anomaly Detection",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its critical application in a wide range of domains, such as social networks, financial risk management, and traffic analysis. Existing GAD methods can be categorized into node and edge anomaly detection models based on the type of graph objects being detected. However, these methods typically treat node and edge anomalies as separate tasks, overlooking their associations and frequent co-occurrences in real-world graphs. As a result, they fail to leverage the complementary information provided by node and edge anomalies for mutual detection. Additionally, state-of-the-art GAD methods, such as CoLA and SL-GAD, heavily rely on negative pair sampling in contrastive learning, which incurs high computational costs, hindering their scalability to large graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified graph anomaly detection framework based on bootstrapped self-supervised learning (named BOURNE). We extract a subgraph (graph view) centered on each target node as node context and transform it into a dual hypergraph (hypergraph view) as edge context. These views are encoded using graph and hypergraph neural networks to capture the representations of nodes, edges, and their associated contexts. By swapping the context embeddings between nodes and edges and measuring the agreement in the embedding space, we enable the mutual detection of node and edge anomalies. Furthermore, BOURNE can eliminate the need for negative sampling, thereby enhancing its efficiency in handling large graphs. Extensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of BOURNE in detecting both node and edge anomalies",

Currently, many efforts have been made on curiosity which can provide a representative intrinsic reward for effective exploration. However, the challenge is still far from being solved. In this paper, we present a novel curiosity for RL, named DyMeCu, which stands for Dynamic Memory-based Curiosity. Inspired by human curiosity and information theory, DyMeCu consists of a dynamic memory and dual online learners. The curiosity arouses if memorized information can not deal with the current state, and the information gap between dual learners can be formulated as the intrinsic reward for agents, and then such state information can be consolidated into the dynamic memory. Compared with previous curiosity methods, DyMeCu can better mimic human curiosity with dynamic memory, and the memory module can be dynamically grown based on a bootstrap paradigm with dual learners. On multiple benchmarks including DeepMind Control Suite and Atari Suite, large-scale empirical experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that DyMeCu outperforms competitive curiosity-based methods with or without extrinsic rewards.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Meta Prompting, a novel technique that revolutionizes the way large language models (LLMs), multi-modal foundation models, and AI systems approach problem-solving and data interpretation. Meta Prompting, rooted in type theory and category theory, prioritizes the structure and syntax of information, providing a unique framework that transcends traditional content-focused methods. We delve into the formal definitions of Meta Prompting, contrasting it with Few-Shot Prompting, and highlight its applicability and superiority in various AI applications. Key to this exploration is the expansion of Meta Prompting into the realm of complex reasoning. Here, we demonstrate how this technique adeptly breaks down intricate problems into manageable sub-problems, facilitating a step-by-step, detailed approach to problem-solving. This method proves especially advantageous in terms of token efficiency and offering a fair comparison in problem-solving scenarios, standing out against few-shot example approaches. Furthermore, the paper breaks new ground by extending Meta Prompting into multi-modal foundation model settings. This extension addresses the integration of diverse data types, such as images, audio, and video, within the structured framework of Meta Prompting, highlighting both the challenges and the vast potential of this approach in handling complex, multi-faceted data (The code is available at https://github.com/meta-prompting/meta-prompting)",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The advent of Blockchain technology (BT) revolutionised the way remittance transactions are recorded. Banks and remittance organisations have shown a growing interest in exploring blockchain's potential advantages over traditional practices. This paper presents a data-driven predictive decision support approach as an innovative artefact designed for the blockchain-oriented remittance industry. Employing a theory-generating Design Science Research (DSR) approach, we have uncovered the emergence of predictive capabilities driven by transactional big data. The artefact integrates predictive analytics and Machine Learning (ML) to enable real-time remittance monitoring, empowering management decision-makers to address challenges in the uncertain digitised landscape of blockchain-oriented remittance companies. Bridging the gap between theory and practice, this research not only enhances the security of the remittance ecosystem but also lays the foundation for future predictive decision support solutions, extending the potential of predictive analytics to other domains. Additionally, the generated theory from the artifact's implementation enriches the DSR approach and fosters grounded and stakeholder theory development in the information systems domain",

We propose a method to efficiently use unlabeled data for extractive summarization of customer-agent dialogs.

We then use these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We demonstrate our method on the \\tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10\\% of the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L, whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L.

We apply our framework to a simple Variational Auto-Encoder model on the RADIATE dataset \\cite{sheeny2021radiate} and qualitatively demonstrate that we can generate new renders of night-time photos using day-time appearance codes without additional optimization iterations.

This phenomenon is more pronounced in the post-covid era, where demand for travel has increased but unevenly among different geographic areas. To counter these problems that both customers and hoteliers are facing, we have developed two auctioning systems that allow hoteliers of lower popularity tier areas or during low season periods to auction their rooms in what we call a forward auction model, and also allows customers to initiate a bidding process whereby hoteliers in an area may make offers to the customer for their rooms, in what constitutes a reverse auction model initiated by the customer, similar to the bidding concept of priceline.com. We develop mathematical programming models that define explicitly both types of auctions, and show that in each type, there are significant benefits to be gained both on the side of the hotelier as well as on the side of the customer. We discuss algorithmic techniques for the approximate solution of these optimization problems, and present results using exact optimization solvers to solve them to guaranteed optimality. These techniques could be beneficial to both customer and hotelier reducing seasonality during middle and low season and providing the customer with attractive offers",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Microscopic image segmentation is a challenging task, wherein the objective is to assign semantic labels to each pixel in a given microscopic image. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) form the foundation of many existing frameworks, they often struggle to explicitly capture long-range dependencies. Although transformers were initially devised to address this issue using self-attention, it has been proven that both local and global features are crucial for addressing diverse challenges in microscopic images, including variations in shape, size, appearance, and target region density. In this paper, we introduce SA2-Net, an attention-guided method that leverages multi-scale feature learning to effectively handle diverse structures within microscopic images. Specifically, we propose scale-aware attention (SA2) module designed to capture inherent variations in scales and shapes of microscopic regions, such as cells, for accurate segmentation. This module incorporates local attention at each level of multi-stage features, as well as global attention across multiple resolutions. Furthermore, we address the issue of blurred region boundaries (e.g., cell boundaries) by introducing a novel upsampling strategy called the Adaptive Up-Attention (AuA) module. This module enhances the discriminative ability for improved localization of microscopic regions using an explicit attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate the benefits of our SA2-Net model. Our source code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/mustansarfiaz/SA2-Net}",

To address the limitations of existing methods trained on structured traffic datasets, we train our model on unstructured datasets including the Indian Driving Dataset and Bengaluru Driving Dataset. Our semi-supervised training pipeline allows SOccDPT to learn from datasets with limited labels by reducing the requirement for manual labelling by substituting it with pseudo-ground truth labels to produce our Bengaluru Semantic Occupancy Dataset. This broader training enhances our model's ability to handle unstructured traffic scenarios effectively. To overcome memory limitations during training, we introduce patch-wise training where we select a subset of parameters to train each epoch, reducing memory usage during auto-grad graph construction. In the context of unstructured traffic and memory-constrained training and inference, SOccDPT outperforms existing disparity estimation approaches as shown by the RMSE score of 9.1473, achieves a semantic segmentation IoU score of 46.02% and operates at a competitive frequency of 69.47 Hz.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) is a technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) that has proven to be very efficient for training off-policy RL-based agents to solve goal-based robotic manipulation tasks using sparse rewards. Even though HER improves the sample efficiency of RL-based agents by learning from mistakes made in past experiences, it does not provide any guidance while exploring the environment. This leads to very large training times due to the volume of experience required to train an agent using this replay strategy. In this paper, we propose a method that uses primitive behaviours that have been previously learned to solve simple tasks in order to guide the agent toward more rewarding actions during exploration while learning other more complex tasks. This guidance, however, is not executed by a manually designed curriculum, but rather using a critic network to decide at each timestep whether or not to use the actions proposed by the previously-learned primitive policies. We evaluate our method by comparing its performance against HER and other more efficient variations of this algorithm in several block manipulation tasks. We demonstrate the agents can learn a successful policy faster when using our proposed method, both in terms of sample efficiency and computation time.

However, it is not yet known whether ChatGPT can serve as a generalist model that can perform many NLP tasks zero-shot. In this work, we empirically analyze the zero-shot learning ability of ChatGPT by evaluating it on 20 popular NLP datasets covering 7 representative task categories. With extensive empirical studies, we demonstrate both the effectiveness and limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We find that ChatGPT performs well on many tasks favoring reasoning capabilities (e.g., arithmetic reasoning) while it still faces challenges when solving specific tasks such as sequence tagging.

    "abstract": "The diffusion of AI and big data is reshaping decision-making processes by increasing the amount of information that supports decisions while reducing direct interaction with data and empirical evidence. This paradigm shift introduces new sources of uncertainty, as limited data observability results in ambiguity and a lack of interpretability. The need for the proper analysis of data-driven strategies motivates the search for new models that can describe this type of bounded access to knowledge. This contribution presents a novel theoretical model for uncertainty in knowledge representation and its transfer mediated by agents. We provide a dynamical description of knowledge states by endowing our model with a structure to compare and combine them. Specifically, an update is represented through combinations, and its explainability is based on its consistency in different dimensional representations. We look at inequivalent knowledge representations in terms of multiplicity of inferences, preference relations, and information measures. Furthermore, we define a formal analogy with two scenarios that illustrate non-classical uncertainty in terms of ambiguity (Ellsberg's model) and reasoning about knowledge mediated by other agents observing data (Wigner's friend). Finally, we discuss some implications of the proposed model for data-driven strategies, with special attention to reasoning under uncertainty about business value dimensions and the design of measurement tools for their assessment",

    "title": "Towards Better Query Classification with Multi-Expert Knowledge Condensation in JD Ads Search",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Search query classification, as an effective way to understand user intents, is of great importance in real-world online ads systems. To ensure a lower latency, a shallow model (e.g. FastText) is widely used for efficient online inference. However, the representation ability of the FastText model is insufficient, resulting in poor classification performance, especially on some low-frequency queries and tailed categories. Using a deeper and more complex model (e.g. BERT) is an effective solution, but it will cause a higher online inference latency and more expensive computing costs. Thus, how to juggle both inference efficiency and classification performance is obviously of great practical importance. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose knowledge condensation (KC), a simple yet effective knowledge distillation framework to boost the classification performance of the online FastText model under strict low latency constraints. Specifically, we propose to train an offline BERT model to retrieve more potentially relevant data. Benefiting from its powerful semantic representation, more relevant labels not exposed in the historical data will be added into the training set for better FastText model training. Moreover, a novel distribution-diverse multi-expert learning strategy is proposed to further improve the mining ability of relevant data. By training multiple BERT models from different data distributions, it can respectively perform better at high, middle, and low-frequency search queries. The model ensemble from multi-distribution makes its retrieval ability more powerful. We have deployed two versions of this framework in JD search, and both offline experiments and online A/B testing from multiple datasets have validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

We empirically analyze a representative set of meta learning algorithms in a wide range of adaptation settings with different source/target task configurations on a large set of few-shot tasks. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MPT. We find the improvement to be significant particularly on classification tasks. For other kinds of tasks such as question answering, we observe that while MPT can outperform PT in most cases, it does not always outperform multi-task learning.

To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure, pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in addressing tasks that necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools that require a blend of task planning and the utilization of external tools, such as APIs. However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them. In response, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents operating within real-world systems. Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further used for in-context learning to boost the final performance.

    "abstract": "We present a review that unifies decision-support methods for exploring the solutions produced by multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms. As MOO is applied to solve diverse problems, approaches for analyzing the trade-offs offered by MOO algorithms are scattered across fields. We provide an overview of the advances on this topic, including methods for visualization, mining the solution set, and uncertainty exploration as well as emerging research directions, including interactivity, explainability, and ethics. We synthesize these methods drawing from different fields of research to build a unified approach, independent of the application. Our goals are to reduce the entry barrier for researchers and practitioners on using MOO algorithms and to provide novel research directions",

    "title": "Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Manipulation Skill Acquisition",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications",

    "abstract": "In this work we systematically review the recent advancements in code processing with language models, covering 50+ models, 30+ evaluation tasks, 150+ datasets, and 550 related works. We break down code processing models into general language models represented by the GPT family and specialized models that are specifically pretrained on code, often with tailored objectives. We discuss the relations and differences between these models, and highlight the historical transition of code modeling from statistical models and RNNs to pretrained Transformers and LLMs, which is exactly the same course that had been taken by NLP. We also discuss code-specific features such as AST, CFG, and unit tests, along with their application in training code language models, and identify key challenges and potential future directions in this domain.

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capacities in bridging the gap between visual and language modalities. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper",

    "title": "Untargeted Black-box Attacks for Social Recommendations",
    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on targeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework Multiattack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Figures of speech such as metaphors, similes, and idioms are integral parts of human communication. They are ubiquitous in many forms of discourse, allowing people to convey complex, abstract ideas and evoke emotion. As figurative forms are often conveyed through multiple modalities (e.g., both text and images), understanding multimodal figurative language is an important AI challenge, weaving together profound vision, language, commonsense and cultural knowledge. In this work, we develop the Image Recognition of Figurative Language (IRFL) dataset. We leverage human annotation and an automatic pipeline we created to generate a multimodal dataset, and introduce two novel tasks as a benchmark for multimodal figurative language understanding. We experimented with state-of-the-art vision and language models and found that the best (22%) performed substantially worse than humans (97%). We release our dataset, benchmark, and code, in hopes of driving the development of models that can better understand figurative language",

To address these challenges, we introduce AtomXR, a streamlined, immersive, no-code XR prototyping tool designed to empower both experienced and inexperienced developers in creating applications using natural language, eye-gaze, and touch interactions. AtomXR consists of: 1) AtomScript, a high-level human-interpretable scripting language for rapid prototyping, 2) a natural language interface that integrates LLMs and multimodal inputs for AtomScript generation, and 3) an immersive in-headset authoring environment. Empirical evaluation through two user studies offers insights into natural language-based and immersive prototyping, and shows AtomXR provides significant improvements in speed and user experience compared to traditional systems",

    "abstract": "While search is the predominant method of accessing information, formulating effective queries remains a challenging task, especially for situations where the users are not familiar with a domain, or searching for documents in other languages, or looking for complex information such as events, which are not easily expressible as queries. Providing example documents or passages of interest, might be easier for a user, however, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and are highly sensitive to the query generation method. This demo illustrates complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting and enabling the user to provide edits and feedback at all stages of the query formulation process. The proposed Query Generation Assistant is a novel search interface which supports automatic and interactive query generation over a mono-linguial or multi-lingual document collection. Specifically, the proposed assistive interface enables the users to refine the queries generated by different LLMs, to provide feedback on the retrieved documents or passages, and is able to incorporate the users' feedback as prompts to generate more effective queries. The proposed interface is a valuable experimental tool for exploring fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs for query generation to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval and ranking models, and for conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries without such assistance",

    "abstract": "Effective cyber threat recognition and prevention demand comprehensible forecasting systems, as prior approaches commonly offer limited and, ultimately, unconvincing information. We introduce Simplified Plaintext Language (SPLAIN), a natural language generator that converts warning data into user-friendly cyber threat explanations. SPLAIN is designed to generate clear, actionable outputs, incorporating hierarchically organized explanatory details about input data and system functionality. Given the inputs of individual sensor-induced forecasting signals and an overall warning from a fusion module, SPLAIN queries each signal for information on contributing sensors and data signals. This collected data is processed into a coherent English explanation, encompassing forecasting, sensing, and data elements for user review. SPLAIN's template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary. SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand. Our conclusions emphasize the need for designers to specify the \"how\" and \"why\" behind cyber warnings, advocate for simple structured templates in generating consistent explanations, and recognize that direct causal links in Machine Learning approaches may not always be identifiable, requiring some explanations to focus on general methodologies, such as model and training data",

    "volume": "November",
    "abstract": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87.

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessments (\"AIIAs\"), a family of tools that provide structured processes to imagine the possible impacts of a proposed AI system, have become an increasingly popular proposal to govern AI systems. Recent efforts from government or private-sector organizations have proposed many diverse instantiations of AIIAs, which take a variety of forms ranging from open-ended questionnaires to graded score-cards. However, to date that has been limited evaluation of existing AIIA instruments. We conduct a classroom study (N = 38) at a large research-intensive university (R1) in an elective course focused on the societal and ethical implications of AI. We assign students to different organizational roles (for example, an ML scientist or product manager) and ask participant teams to complete one of three existing AI impact assessments for one of two imagined generative AI systems. In our thematic analysis of participants' responses to pre- and post-activity questionnaires, we find preliminary evidence that impact assessments can influence participants' perceptions of the potential risks of generative AI systems, and the level of responsibility held by AI experts in addressing potential harm. We also discover a consistent set of limitations shared by several existing AIIA instruments, which we group into concerns about their format and content, as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the activity in foreseeing and mitigating potential harms. Drawing on the findings of this study, we provide recommendations for future work on developing and validating AIIAs",

To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications.
