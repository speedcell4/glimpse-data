    "title": "SODA: Bottleneck Diffusion Models for Representation Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce SODA, a self-supervised diffusion model, designed for representation learning. The model incorporates an image encoder, which distills a source view into a compact representation, that, in turn, guides the generation of related novel views. We show that by imposing a tight bottleneck between the encoder and a denoising decoder, and leveraging novel view synthesis as a self-supervised objective, we can turn diffusion models into strong representation learners, capable of capturing visual semantics in an unsupervised manner. To the best of our knowledge, SODA is the first diffusion model to succeed at ImageNet linear-probe classification, and, at the same time, it accomplishes reconstruction, editing and synthesis tasks across a wide range of datasets. Further investigation reveals the disentangled nature of its emergent latent space, that serves as an effective interface to control and manipulate the model's produced images. All in all, we aim to shed light on the exciting and promising potential of diffusion models, not only for image generation, but also for learning rich and robust representations",

    "title": "Knowledge Pursuit Prompting for Zero-Shot Multimodal Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hallucinations and unfaithful synthesis due to inaccurate prompts with insufficient semantic details are widely observed in multimodal generative models. A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune the generator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such a procedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is: can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative models beyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, we propose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPP employs a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative external facts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress the acquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generators for visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing the architectures and parameters of generative models. We evaluate the framework across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video) on datasets of different domains. We further demonstrate the extensibility and adaptability of KPP through varying foundation model bases and instructions. Our results show that KPP is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising solution to improve multimodal generative models",

    "abstract": "Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several base models. We study whether or not including more models in an ensemble always improve its average performance. Such a question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, as well as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all members of the ensemble are a priori expected to perform as well, which is the case of several popular methods like random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting, we essentially show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and only if, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, the average loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models. When the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can be summarised by the insight that ensembles of good models keep getting better, and ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a new result on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independent interest. We illustrate our results on a simple machine learning problem (diagnosing melanomas using neural nets)",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence for Science (AI4S) is an emerging research field that utilizes machine learning advancements to tackle complex scientific computational issues, aiming to enhance computational efficiency and accuracy. However, the data-driven nature of AI4S lacks the correctness or accuracy assurances of conventional scientific computing, posing challenges when deploying AI4S models in real-world applications. To mitigate these, more comprehensive benchmarking procedures are needed to better understand AI4S models. This paper introduces a novel benchmarking approach, known as structural interpretation, which addresses two key requirements: identifying the trusted operating range in the problem space and tracing errors back to their computational components. This method partitions both the problem and metric spaces, facilitating a structural exploration of these spaces. The practical utility and effectiveness of structural interpretation are illustrated through its application to three distinct AI4S workloads: machine-learning force fields (MLFF), jet tagging, and precipitation nowcasting. The benchmarks effectively model the trusted operating range, trace errors, and reveal novel perspectives for refining the model, training process, and data sampling strategy. This work is part of the SAIBench project, an AI4S benchmarking suite",

    "abstract": "Most real-world networks are noisy and incomplete samples from an unknown target distribution. Refining them by correcting corruptions or inferring unobserved regions typically improves downstream performance. Inspired by the impressive generative capabilities that have been used to correct corruptions in images, and the similarities between \"in-painting\" and filling in missing nodes and edges conditioned on the observed graph, we propose a novel graph generative framework, SGDM, which is based on subgraph diffusion. Our framework not only improves the scalability and fidelity of graph diffusion models, but also leverages the reverse process to perform novel, conditional generation tasks. In particular, through extensive empirical analysis and a set of novel metrics, we demonstrate that our proposed model effectively supports the following refinement tasks for partially observable networks: T1: denoising extraneous subgraphs, T2: expanding existing subgraphs and T3: performing \"style\" transfer by regenerating a particular subgraph to match the characteristics of a different node or subgraph",

More recently, researchers have extended the principles of contrastive learning to graph-structured data, giving birth to the field of graph contrastive learning (GCL). However, whether GCL methods can deliver the same advantages in adversarial robustness as their counterparts in the image and text domains remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive robustness evaluation protocol tailored to assess the robustness of GCL models. We subject these models to adaptive adversarial attacks targeting the graph structure, specifically in the evasion scenario. We evaluate node and graph classification tasks using diverse real-world datasets and attack strategies.

    "abstract": "In this study, we are interested in imbuing robots with the capability of physically-grounded task planning. Recent advancements have shown that large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge useful in robotic tasks, especially in reasoning and planning. However, LLMs are constrained by their lack of world grounding and dependence on external affordance models to perceive environmental information, which cannot jointly reason with LLMs. We argue that a task planner should be an inherently grounded, unified multimodal system. To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes. It also supports flexible multimodal goal specification and naturally incorporates visual feedback. Our extensive evaluation, conducted in both real-robot and simulated environments, demonstrates ViLa's superiority over existing LLM-based planners, highlighting its effectiveness in a wide array of open-world manipulation tasks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-dimensional Scaling (MDS) is a family of methods for embedding pair-wise dissimilarities between $n$ objects into low-dimensional space. MDS is widely used as a data visualization tool in the social and biological sciences, statistics, and machine learning. We study the Kamada-Kawai formulation of MDS: given a set of non-negative dissimilarities $\\{d_{i,j}\\}_{i , j \\in [n]}$ over $n$ points, the goal is to find an embedding $\\{x_1,\\dots,x_n\\} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^k$ that minimizes \\[ \\text{OPT} = \\min_{x} \\mathbb{E}_{i,j \\in [n]} \\left[ \\left(1-\\frac{\\|x_i - x_j\\|}{d_{i,j}}\\right)^2 \\right] \\] Despite its popularity, our theoretical understanding of MDS is extremely limited. Recently, Demaine, Hesterberg, Koehler, Lynch, and Urschel (arXiv:2109.11505) gave the first approximation algorithm with provable guarantees for Kamada-Kawai, which achieves an embedding with cost $\\text{OPT} +\\epsilon$ in $n^2 \\cdot 2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(k \\Delta^4 / \\epsilon^2)}$ time, where $\\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the input dissimilarities. In this work, we give the first approximation algorithm for MDS with quasi-polynomial dependency on $\\Delta$: for target dimension $k$, we achieve a solution with cost $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{OPT}^{ \\hspace{0.04in}1/k } \\cdot \\log(\\Delta/\\epsilon) )+ \\epsilon$ in time $n^{ \\mathcal{O}(1)} \\cdot 2^{\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}( k^2 (\\log(\\Delta)/\\epsilon)^{k/2 + 1} ) }$. Our approach is based on a novel analysis of a conditioning-based rounding scheme for the Sherali-Adams LP Hierarchy. Crucially, our analysis exploits the geometry of low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing us to avoid an exponential dependence on the aspect ratio $\\Delta$. We believe our geometry-aware treatment of the Sherali-Adams Hierarchy is an important step towards developing general-purpose techniques for efficient metric optimization algorithms",

    "abstract": "While deep learning has led to huge progress in complex image classification tasks like ImageNet, unexpected failure modes, e.g. via spurious features, call into question how reliably these classifiers work in the wild. Furthermore, for safety-critical tasks the black-box nature of their decisions is problematic, and explanations or at least methods which make decisions plausible are needed urgently. In this paper, we address these problems by generating images that optimize a classifier-derived objective using a framework for guided image generation. We analyze the behavior and decisions of image classifiers by visual counterfactual explanations (VCEs), detection of systematic mistakes by analyzing images where classifiers maximally disagree, and visualization of neurons to verify potential spurious features. In this way, we validate existing observations, e.g. the shape bias of adversarially robust models, as well as novel failure modes, e.g. systematic errors of zero-shot CLIP classifiers, or identify harmful spurious features. Moreover, our VCEs outperform previous work while being more versatile",

    "title": "Towards Efficient Hyperdimensional Computing Using Photonics",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, silicon photonics-based computing has emerged as a promising alternative to CMOS-based computing for Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Unfortunately, the non-linear operations and the high-precision requirements of DNNs make it extremely challenging to design efficient silicon photonics-based systems for DNN inference and training. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is an emerging, brain-inspired machine learning technique that enjoys several advantages over existing DNNs, including being lightweight, requiring low-precision operands, and being robust to noise introduced by the nonidealities in the hardware. For HDC, computing in-memory (CiM) approaches have been widely used, as CiM reduces the data transfer cost if the operands can fit into the memory. However, inefficient multi-bit operations, high write latency, and low endurance make CiM ill-suited for HDC. On the other hand, the existing electro-photonic DNN accelerators are inefficient for HDC because they are specifically optimized for matrix multiplication in DNNs and consume a lot of power with high-precision data converters. In this paper, we argue that photonic computing and HDC complement each other better than photonic computing and DNNs, or CiM and HDC. We propose PhotoHDC, the first-ever electro-photonic accelerator for HDC training and inference, supporting the basic, record-based, and graph encoding schemes. Evaluating with popular datasets, we show that our accelerator can achieve two to five orders of magnitude lower EDP than the state-of-the-art electro-photonic DNN accelerators for implementing HDC training and inference. PhotoHDC also achieves four orders of magnitude lower energy-delay product than CiM-based accelerators for both HDC training and inference",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Stochastic simulation models, while effective in capturing the dynamics of complex systems, are often too slow to run for real-time decision-making. Metamodeling techniques are widely used to learn the relationship between a summary statistic of the outputs (e.g., the mean or quantile) and the inputs of the simulator, so that it can be used in real time. However, this methodology requires the knowledge of an appropriate summary statistic in advance, making it inflexible for many practical situations. In this paper, we propose a new metamodeling concept, called generative metamodeling, which aims to construct a \"fast simulator of the simulator\". This technique can generate random outputs substantially faster than the original simulation model, while retaining an approximately equal conditional distribution given the same inputs. Once constructed, a generative metamodel can instantaneously generate a large amount of random outputs as soon as the inputs are specified, thereby facilitating the immediate computation of any summary statistic for real-time decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm -- quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) -- and study its convergence and rate of convergence. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to investigate the empirical performance of QRGMM, compare it with other state-of-the-art generative algorithms, and demonstrate its usefulness in practical real-time decision-making",

We introduce an assumption that the minority class or anomalous appear more frequently in the margin of the features. Consequently, MLS aims to preserve the local structure of the data set's margin. As MLS is better suited for handling imbalanced data, we propose its integration into modern feature selection methods that utilize the Laplacian score.

Inspired by GNNs that separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\\Pi$, we re-frame the distillation process as making the student MLP learn both $T$ and $\\Pi$. Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$ before distillation from the teacher, it still comes with a high computational cost from large matrix multiplications during training. To solve this problem, we propose Propagate & Distill (P&D), which propagates the output of the teacher before distillation, which can be interpreted as an approximate process of the inverse propagation.

The relative margin form is broadly useful for understanding and analyzing multiclass losses as shown by our prior work (Wang and Scott, 2020, 2021). To further demonstrate the utility of this way of expressing multiclass losses, we use it to extend the seminal result of Bartlett et al.

Sentence transformers are the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in popularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations. Having effective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence comparison. Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers, evaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance. This work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders. We employ several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness. This system uses character-level attacks in the form of random character substitution, word-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level attacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling. The results of the experiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders. The models produce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed datasets. The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed datasets as compared to unperturbed datasets. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic structure (sentence order) of sentences.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the limitations of existing text-to-image diffusion models in generating demographically fair results when given human-related descriptions. These models often struggle to disentangle the target language context from sociocultural biases, resulting in biased image generation. To overcome this challenge, we propose Fair Mapping, a general, model-agnostic, and lightweight approach that modifies a pre-trained text-to-image model by controlling the prompt to achieve fair image generation. One key advantage of our approach is its high efficiency. The training process only requires updating a small number of parameters in an additional linear mapping network. This not only reduces the computational cost but also accelerates the optimization process. We first demonstrate the issue of bias in generated results caused by language biases in text-guided diffusion models. By developing a mapping network that projects language embeddings into an unbiased space, we enable the generation of relatively balanced demographic results based on a keyword specified in the prompt. With comprehensive experiments on face image generation, we show that our method significantly improves image generation performance when prompted with descriptions related to human faces. By effectively addressing the issue of bias, we produce more fair and diverse image outputs. This work contributes to the field of text-to-image generation by enhancing the ability to generate images that accurately reflect the intended demographic characteristics specified in the text",

    "title": "Toward a Surgeon-in-the-Loop Ophthalmic Robotic Apprentice using Reinforcement and Imitation Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Robotic-assisted surgical systems have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing surgical precision and minimizing human errors. However, existing systems lack the ability to accommodate the unique preferences and requirements of individual surgeons. Additionally, they primarily focus on general surgeries (e.g., laparoscopy) and are not suitable for highly precise microsurgeries, such as ophthalmic procedures. Thus, we propose a simulation-based image-guided approach for surgeon-centered autonomous agents that can adapt to the individual surgeon's skill level and preferred surgical techniques during ophthalmic cataract surgery. Our approach utilizes a simulated environment to train reinforcement and imitation learning agents guided by image data to perform all tasks of the incision phase of cataract surgery. By integrating the surgeon's actions and preferences into the training process with the surgeon-in-the-loop, our approach enables the robot to implicitly learn and adapt to the individual surgeon's unique approach through demonstrations. This results in a more intuitive and personalized surgical experience for the surgeon. Simultaneously, it ensures consistent performance for the autonomous robotic apprentice. We define and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using our proposed metrics; and highlight the trade-off between a generic agent and a surgeon-centered adapted agent. Moreover, our approach has the potential to extend to other ophthalmic surgical procedures, opening the door to a new generation of surgeon-in-the-loop autonomous surgical robots. We provide an open-source simulation framework for future development and reproducibility",

Surprisingly, this continuous-time Markov process is the well-known and well-studied Ornstein-Ohlenbeck (OU) process, which was developed in 1930's for studying Brownian particles in Harmonic potentials. We establish the formal equivalence between DDPM and the OU process using its analytical solution. We further demonstrate that the design problem of the noise scheduler for non-homogeneous DDPM is equivalent to designing observation times for the OU process. We present several heuristic designs for observation times based on principled quantities such as auto-variance and Fisher Information and connect them to ad hoc noise schedules for DDPM. Interestingly, we show that the Fisher-Information-motivated schedule corresponds exactly the cosine schedule, which was developed without any theoretical foundation but is the current state-of-the-art noise schedule",

The exponential growth in feature space dimensionality for modern datasets directly results in ambiguous samples and redundant features, which can severely degrade classification accuracy. Quantum machine learning offers potential advantages for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel method, quantum support vector machine feature selection (QSVMF), integrating quantum support vector machines with multi-objective genetic algorithm. QSVMF optimizes multiple simultaneous objectives: maximizing classification accuracy, minimizing selected features and quantum circuit costs, and reducing feature covariance. We apply QSVMF for feature selection on a breast cancer dataset, comparing the performance of QSVMF against classical approaches with the selected features. Experimental results show that QSVMF achieves superior performance. Furthermore, The Pareto front solutions of QSVMF enable analysis of accuracy versus feature set size trade-offs, identifying extremely sparse yet accurate feature subsets. We contextualize the biological relevance of the selected features in terms of known breast cancer biomarkers.

We delve into the adversarial robustness of memory-based continual learning algorithms and observe limited robustness improvement by directly applying adversarial training techniques. Preliminary studies reveal the twin challenges for building adversarial robust continual learners: accelerated forgetting in continual learning and gradient obfuscation in adversarial robustness. In this study, we put forward a novel adversarial robust memory-based continual learner that adjusts data logits to mitigate the forgetting of pasts caused by adversarial samples. Furthermore, we devise a gradient-based data selection mechanism to overcome the gradient obfuscation caused by limited stored data. The proposed approach can widely integrate with existing memory-based continual learning as well as adversarial training algorithms in a plug-and-play way.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Embedding graphs in continous spaces is a key factor in designing and developing algorithms for automatic information extraction to be applied in diverse tasks (e.g., learning, inferring, predicting). The reliability of graph embeddings directly depends on how much the geometry of the continuous space matches the graph structure. Manifolds are mathematical structure that can enable to incorporate in their topological spaces the graph characteristics, and in particular nodes distances. State-of-the-art of manifold-based graph embedding algorithms take advantage of the assumption that the projection on a tangential space of each point in the manifold (corresponding to a node in the graph) would locally resemble a Euclidean space. Although this condition helps in achieving efficient analytical solutions to the embedding problem, it does not represent an adequate set-up to work with modern real life graphs, that are characterized by weighted connections across nodes often computed over sparse datasets with missing records. In this work, we introduce a new class of manifold, named soft manifold, that can solve this situation. In particular, soft manifolds are mathematical structures with spherical symmetry where the tangent spaces to each point are hypocycloids whose shape is defined according to the velocity of information propagation across the data points. Using soft manifolds for graph embedding, we can provide continuous spaces to pursue any task in data analysis over complex datasets. Experimental results on reconstruction tasks on synthetic and real datasets show how the proposed approach enable more accurate and reliable characterization of graphs in continuous spaces with respect to the state-of-the-art",

However, experiments on visual control tasks have revealed that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. Conversely, expressing higher-level concepts and global contexts is relatively easy using language. Building upon recent success of the large language models, our main objective is to improve the state abstraction technique in reinforcement learning by leveraging language for robust action selection. Specifically, we focus on learning language-grounded visual features to enhance the world model learning, a model-based reinforcement learning technique. To enforce our hypothesis explicitly, we mask out the bounding boxes of a few objects in the image observation and provide the text prompt as descriptions for these masked objects. Subsequently, we predict the masked objects along with the surrounding regions as pixel reconstruction, similar to the transformer-based masked autoencoder approach. Our proposed LanGWM: Language Grounded World Model achieves state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution test at the 100K interaction steps benchmarks of iGibson point navigation tasks.

We aim to minimize the average regret on $M$ machines working in parallel over $T$ rounds with $R$ intermittent communications. Assuming the underlying cost functions are convex and can be generated adaptively, our results show that collaboration is not beneficial when the machines have access to the first-order gradient information at the queried points. This is in contrast to the case for stochastic functions, where each machine samples the cost functions from a fixed distribution. Furthermore, we delve into the more challenging setting of federated online optimization with bandit (zeroth-order) feedback, where the machines can only access values of the cost functions at the queried points. The key finding here is identifying the high-dimensional regime where collaboration is beneficial and may even lead to a linear speedup in the number of machines. We further illustrate our findings through federated adversarial linear bandits by developing novel distributed single and two-point feedback algorithms. Our work is the first attempt towards a systematic understanding of federated online optimization with limited feedback, and it attains tight regret bounds in the intermittent communication setting for both first and zeroth-order feedback. Our results thus bridge the gap between stochastic and adaptive settings in federated online optimization",

    "abstract": "Training an overparameterized neural network can yield minimizers of the same level of training loss and yet different generalization capabilities. With evidence that indicates a correlation between sharpness of minima and their generalization errors, increasing efforts have been made to develop an optimization method to explicitly find flat minima as more generalizable solutions. This sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) strategy, however, has not been studied much yet as to how overparameterization can actually affect its behavior. In this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization and present both empirical and theoretical results that suggest a critical influence of overparameterization on SAM. Specifically, we first use standard techniques in optimization to prove that SAM can achieve a linear convergence rate under overparameterization in a stochastic setting. We also show that the linearly stable minima found by SAM are indeed flatter and have more uniformly distributed Hessian moments compared to those of SGD. These results are corroborated with our experiments that reveal a consistent trend that the generalization improvement made by SAM continues to increase as the model becomes more overparameterized.

To this end, we introduce an evaluation protocol based on dynamic vocabulary generation to test whether models detect, discern, and assign the correct fine-grained description to objects in the presence of hard-negative classes. We contribute with a benchmark suite of increasing difficulty and probing different properties like color, pattern, and material. We further enhance our investigation by evaluating several state-of-the-art open-vocabulary object detectors using the proposed protocol and find that most existing solutions, which shine in standard open-vocabulary benchmarks, struggle to accurately capture and distinguish finer object details.

In response, researchers have considered adopting patch-level augmentation or applying mixup augmentation, but their applicability remains unverified. Our approach augments the training dataset by sampling a subset of patches in the WSI without significantly altering the underlying semantics of the original slides. Additionally, we introduce an efficient model (Slot-MIL) that organizes patches into a fixed number of slots, the abstract representation of patches, using an attention mechanism. We empirically demonstrate that the subsampling augmentation helps to make more informative slots by restricting the over-concentration of attention and to improve interpretability. Finally, we illustrate that combining our attention-based aggregation model with subsampling and mixup, which has shown limited compatibility in existing MIL methods, can enhance both generalization and calibration. Our proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance across various benchmark datasets including class imbalance and distribution shifts",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Digital twin, which enables emulation, evaluation, and optimization of physical entities through synchronized digital replicas, has gained increasingly attention as a promising technology for intricate wireless networks. For 6G, numerous innovative wireless technologies and network architectures have posed new challenges in establishing wireless network digital twins. To tackle these challenges, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the flourishing generative AI, emerges as a potential solution. In this article, we discuss emerging prerequisites for wireless network digital twins considering the complicated network architecture, tremendous network scale, extensive coverage, and diversified application scenarios in the 6G era. We further explore the applications of generative AI, such as transformer and diffusion model, to empower the 6G digital twin from multiple perspectives including implementation, physical-digital synchronization, and slicing capability. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical generative AI-enabled wireless network digital twin at both the message-level and policy-level, and provide a typical use case with numerical results to validate the effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, open research issues for wireless network digital twins in the 6G era are discussed",

    "title": "Uncertainty in Additive Feature Attribution methods",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we explore various topics that fall under the umbrella of Uncertainty in post-hoc Explainable AI (XAI) methods. We in particular focus on the class of additive feature attribution explanation methods. We first describe our specifications of uncertainty and compare various statistical and recent methods to quantify the same. Next, for a particular instance, we study the relationship between a feature's attribution and its uncertainty and observe little correlation. As a result, we propose a modification in the distribution from which perturbations are sampled in LIME-based algorithms such that the important features have minimal uncertainty without an increase in computational cost. Next, while studying how the uncertainty in explanations varies across the feature space of a classifier, we observe that a fraction of instances show near-zero uncertainty. We coin the term \"stable instances\" for such instances and diagnose factors that make an instance stable. Next, we study how an XAI algorithm's uncertainty varies with the size and complexity of the underlying model. We observe that the more complex the model, the more inherent uncertainty is exhibited by it. As a result, we propose a measure to quantify the relative complexity of a blackbox classifier. This could be incorporated, for example, in LIME-based algorithms' sampling densities, to help different explanation algorithms achieve tighter confidence levels. Together, the above measures would have a strong impact on making XAI models relatively trustworthy for the end-user as well as aiding scientific discovery",

    "title": "Group-wise Sparse and Explainable Adversarial Attacks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Sparse adversarial attacks fool deep neural networks (DNNs) through minimal pixel perturbations, typically regularized by the $\\ell_0$ norm. Recent efforts have replaced this norm with a structural sparsity regularizer, such as the nuclear group norm, to craft group-wise sparse adversarial attacks. The resulting perturbations are thus explainable and hold significant practical relevance, shedding light on an even greater vulnerability of DNNs than previously anticipated. However, crafting such attacks poses an optimization challenge, as it involves computing norms for groups of pixels within a non-convex objective. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by presenting an algorithm that simultaneously generates group-wise sparse attacks within semantically meaningful areas of an image. In each iteration, the core operation of our algorithm involves the optimization of a quasinorm adversarial loss. This optimization is achieved by employing the $1/2$-quasinorm proximal operator for some iterations, a method tailored for nonconvex programming. Subsequently, the algorithm transitions to a projected Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent with $2$-norm regularization applied to perturbation magnitudes. We rigorously evaluate the efficacy of our novel attack in both targeted and non-targeted attack scenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. When compared to state-of-the-art methods, our attack consistently results in a remarkable increase in group-wise sparsity, e.g., an increase of $48.12\\%$ on CIFAR-10 and $40.78\\%$ on ImageNet (average case, targeted attack), all while maintaining lower perturbation magnitudes. Notably, this performance is complemented by a significantly faster computation time and a $100\\%$ attack success rate",

Grounding FMs by adapting them to domain-specific tasks or augmenting them with domain-specific knowledge enables us to exploit the full potential of FMs. However, grounding FMs faces several challenges, stemming primarily from constrained computing resources, data privacy, model heterogeneity, and model ownership. Federated Transfer Learning (FTL), the combination of federated learning and transfer learning, provides promising solutions to address these challenges. In recent years, the need for grounding FMs leveraging FTL, coined FTL-FM, has arisen strongly in both academia and industry. Motivated by the strong growth in FTL-FM research and the potential impact of FTL-FM on industrial applications, we propose an FTL-FM framework that formulates problems of grounding FMs in the federated learning setting, construct a detailed taxonomy based on the FTL-FM framework to categorize state-of-the-art FTL-FM works, and comprehensively overview FTL-FM works based on the proposed taxonomy. We also establish correspondences between FTL-FM and conventional phases of adapting FM so that FM practitioners can align their research works with FTL-FM. In addition, we overview advanced efficiency-improving and privacy-preserving techniques because efficiency and privacy are critical concerns in FTL-FM.

GNNFlow introduces an adaptive time-indexed block-based data structure that effectively balances memory usage with graph update and sampling operation efficiency. It features a hybrid GPU-CPU graph data placement for rapid GPU-based temporal neighborhood sampling and kernel optimizations for enhanced sampling processes. A dynamic GPU cache for node and edge features is developed to maximize cache hit rates through reuse and restoration strategies. GNNFlow supports distributed training across multiple machines with static scheduling to ensure load balance. We implement GNNFlow based on DGL and PyTorch.

In this paper, we proposed a novel pretrained model called Gene-MOE to learn the general feature representations of the Pan-Cancer dataset and transfer the pretrained weights to the downstream tasks. The Gene-MOE fully exploits the mixture of expert (MOE) layers to learn rich feature representations of high-dimensional genes. At the same time, we build a mixture of attention expert (MOAE) model to learn the deep semantic relationships within genetic features. Finally, we proposed a new self-supervised pretraining strategy including loss function design, data enhancement, and optimization strategy to train the Gene-MOE and further improve the performance for the downstream analysis. We carried out cancer classification and survival analysis experiments based on the Gene-MOE. According to the survival analysis results on 14 cancer types, using Gene-MOE outperformed state-of-the-art models on 12 cancer types. According to the classification results, the total accuracy of the classification model for 33 cancer classifications reached 95.2\\%.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, have been widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional performance. However, recent studies show their vulnerability to textual adversarial attacks where the model's output can be misled by intentionally manipulating the text inputs. Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's robustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption resources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection (e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called dynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the inherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks. Our method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional costs. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention rectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens, and (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\\% better performance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The model-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with other defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the model's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic attention preserves the state-of-the-art robustness space of the original model compared to other dynamic modeling methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are being increasingly used in many high-stakes tasks, and as a result, there is growing attention on their fairness recently. GNNs have been shown to be unfair as they tend to make discriminatory decisions toward certain demographic groups, divided by sensitive attributes such as gender and race. While recent works have been devoted to improving their fairness performance, they often require accessible demographic information. This greatly limits their applicability in real-world scenarios due to legal restrictions. To address this problem, we present a demographic-agnostic method to learn fair GNNs via knowledge distillation, namely FairGKD. Our work is motivated by the empirical observation that training GNNs on partial data (i.e., only node attributes or topology data) can improve their fairness, albeit at the cost of utility. To make a balanced trade-off between fairness and utility performance, we employ a set of fairness experts (i.e., GNNs trained on different partial data) to construct the synthetic teacher, which distills fairer and informative knowledge to guide the learning of the GNN student. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairGKD, which does not require access to demographic information, significantly improves the fairness of GNNs by a large margin while maintaining their utility",

It employs a multivariate normal distribution for the initial state of the quantum search and repeatedly updates it throughout the optimization process. Our numerical experiments show that QuADS outperforms both GAS and CMA-ES.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has laid the foundation for deploying deep learning models. However, most fine-tuning methods are designed to meet a specific resource budget. Recently, considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets, stitchable neural network (SN-Net) is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising, SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains, including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work, we present a novel framework, Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA), to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically, we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way, we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore, we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline, which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches, we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family, obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes",

Yet the differences in performance seem often minor and are barely understood to date. In this paper, we study SSL based on persistent homology (PH), a mathematical tool for modeling topological features of data that persist across multiple scales. It has several unique features which particularly suit SSL, naturally offering: different views of the data, stability in terms of distance preservation, and the opportunity to flexibly incorporate domain knowledge. We (1) investigate an autoencoder, which shows the general representational power of PH, and (2) propose a contrastive loss that complements existing approaches. We rigorously evaluate our approach for molecular property prediction and demonstrate its particular features in improving the embedding space: after SSL, the representations are better and offer considerably more predictive power than the baselines over different probing tasks; our loss increases baseline performance, sometimes largely; and we often obtain substantial improvements over very small datasets, a common scenario in practice",

Data aggregation is proposed to combine the data across problems to improve the decisions obtained by solving those problems individually. We propose a novel cluster-based shrunken-SAA approach that can exploit the cluster structure among problems when implementing the data aggregation approaches. We prove that, as the number of problems grows, leveraging the known cluster structure among problems yields additional benefits over the data aggregation approaches that neglect such structure. When the cluster structure is unknown, we show that unveiling the cluster structure, even at the cost of a few data points, can be beneficial, especially when the distance between clusters of problems is substantial. Our proposed approach can be extended to general cost functions under mild conditions. When the number of problems gets large, the optimality gap of our proposed approach decreases exponentially in the distance between the clusters. We explore the performance of the proposed approach through the application of managing newsvendor systems via numerical experiments. We investigate the impacts of distance metrics between problem instances on the performance of the cluster-based Shrunken-SAA approach with synthetic data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a generic methodology to encode hierarchical causality structure among observed variables into a neural network in order to improve its predictive performance. The proposed methodology, called causality-informed neural network (CINN), leverages three coherent steps to systematically map the structural causal knowledge into the layer-to-layer design of neural network while strictly preserving the orientation of every causal relationship. In the first step, CINN discovers causal relationships from observational data via directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning, where causal discovery is recast as a continuous optimization problem to avoid the combinatorial nature. In the second step, the discovered hierarchical causality structure among observed variables is systematically encoded into neural network through a dedicated architecture and customized loss function. By categorizing variables in the causal DAG as root, intermediate, and leaf nodes, the hierarchical causal DAG is translated into CINN with a one-to-one correspondence between nodes in the causal DAG and units in the CINN while maintaining the relative order among these nodes. Regarding the loss function, both intermediate and leaf nodes in the DAG graph are treated as target outputs during CINN training so as to drive co-learning of causal relationships among different types of nodes. As multiple loss components emerge in CINN, we leverage the projection of conflicting gradients to mitigate gradient interference among the multiple learning tasks. Computational experiments across a broad spectrum of UCI data sets demonstrate substantial advantages of CINN in predictive performance over other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, an ablation study underscores the value of integrating structural and quantitative causal knowledge in enhancing the neural network's predictive performance incrementally",

Current communication-efficient FL strategies, such as gradient compression, reduce bitrates to around $1$ bit-per-parameter (bpp). However, these approaches fail to harness the characteristics of FMs, with their large number of parameters still posing a challenge to communication efficiency, even at these bitrate regimes. In this work, we present DeltaMask, a novel method that efficiently fine-tunes FMs in FL at an ultra-low bitrate, well below 1 bpp. DeltaMask employs stochastic masking to detect highly effective subnetworks within FMs and leverage stochasticity and sparsity in client masks to compress updates into a compact grayscale image using probabilistic filters, deviating from traditional weight training approaches. Our comprehensive evaluations across various datasets and architectures demonstrate DeltaMask efficiently achieves bitrates as low as 0.09 bpp, enhancing communication efficiency while maintaining FMs performance, as measured on 8 datasets and 5 pre-trained models of various network architectures",

    "abstract": "Understanding whether a property is priced fairly hinders buyers and sellers since they usually do not have an objective viewpoint of the price distribution for the overall market of their interest. Drawing from data collected of all possible available properties for rent in Manhattan as of September 2023, this paper aims to strengthen our understanding of model residuals; specifically on machine learning models which generalize for a majority of the distribution of a well-proportioned dataset. Most models generally perceive deviations from predicted values as mere inaccuracies, however this paper proposes a different vantage point: when generalizing to at least 75\\% of the data-set, the remaining deviations reveal significant insights. To harness these insights, we introduce the Price Anomaly Score (PAS), a metric capable of capturing boundaries between irregularly predicted prices. By combining relative pricing discrepancies with statistical significance, the Price Anomaly Score (PAS) offers a multifaceted view of rental valuations. This metric allows experts to identify overpriced or underpriced properties within a dataset by aggregating PAS values, then fine-tuning upper and lower boundaries to any threshold to set indicators of choice",

Popular tuning solutions during runtime involve checkpoints and schedulers. Adjusting hyper-parameters usually require the program to be restarted, wasting utilization and time, while placing unnecessary strain on memory and processors. We present LiveTune, a new framework allowing real-time parameter tuning during training through LiveVariables. Live Variables allow for a continuous training session by storing parameters on designated ports on the system, allowing them to be dynamically adjusted. Extensive evaluations of our framework show saving up to 60 seconds and 5.4 Kilojoules of energy per hyperparameter change",

The scattering matrix is calculated as a perturbative series, and represented succinctly as a first order differential equation in time. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) learn the time derivative of a residual network's hidden state, and have proven efficacy in learning differential equations with physical constraints. Hence using an NDE to learn particle scattering matrices presents a possible experiment-theory phenomenological connection. In this paper, NDE models are used to learn $\\phi^4$ theory, Scalar-Yukawa theory and Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics. A new NDE architecture is also introduced, the Fourier Neural Differential Equation (FNDE), which combines NDE integration and Fourier network convolution. The FNDE model demonstrates better generalisability than the non-integrated equivalent FNO model. It is also shown that by training on scattering data, the interaction Hamiltonian of a theory can be extracted from network parameters",

    "abstract": "Prosody -- the suprasegmental component of speech, including pitch, loudness, and tempo -- carries critical aspects of meaning. However, the relationship between the information conveyed by prosody vs. by the words themselves remains poorly understood. We use large language models (LLMs) to estimate how much information is redundant between prosody and the words themselves. Using a large spoken corpus of English audiobooks, we extract prosodic features aligned to individual words and test how well they can be predicted from LLM embeddings, compared to non-contextual word embeddings. We find a high degree of redundancy between the information carried by the words and prosodic information across several prosodic features, including intensity, duration, pauses, and pitch contours. Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is redundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as following it. Still, we observe that prosodic features can not be fully predicted from text, suggesting that prosody carries information above and beyond the words. Along with this paper, we release a general-purpose data processing pipeline for quantifying the relationship between linguistic information and extra-linguistic features",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Like masked language modeling (MLM) in natural language processing, masked image modeling (MIM) aims to extract valuable insights from image patches to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the underlying deep neural network (DNN). Contrasted with other training paradigms like supervised learning and unsupervised contrastive learning, masked image modeling (MIM) pretraining typically demands significant computational resources in order to manage large training data batches (e.g., 4096). The significant memory and computation requirements pose a considerable challenge to its broad adoption. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel learning framework, termed~\\textit{Block-Wise Masked Image Modeling} (BIM). This framework involves decomposing the MIM tasks into several sub-tasks with independent computation patterns, resulting in block-wise back-propagation operations instead of the traditional end-to-end approach. Our proposed BIM maintains superior performance compared to conventional MIM while greatly reducing peak memory consumption. Moreover, BIM naturally enables the concurrent training of numerous DNN backbones of varying depths. This leads to the creation of multiple trained DNN backbones, each tailored to different hardware platforms with distinct computing capabilities. This approach significantly reduces computational costs in comparison with training each DNN backbone individually. Our framework offers a promising solution for resource constrained training of MIM",

Recent research indicates that brain signals can be very effective for emotion recognition. However, which parts of the brain exhibit most of the emotions is still under-explored. In this study, we empirically analyze the contribution of each part of the brain in exhibiting emotions. We use the DEAP dataset to find the most optimal electrode set which eventually leads to the effective brain part associated with emotions. We use Fast Fourier Transformation for effective feature extraction and a 1D-CNN with residual connection for classification. Though 32 electrodes from the DEAP dataset got an accuracy of 97.34%, only 12 electrodes (F7, P8, O1, F8, C4, T7, PO3, Fp1, Fp2, O2, P3, and Fz) achieve 95.81% accuracy. This study also shows that adding more than 10 electrodes does not improve performance significantly. Moreover, the frontal lobe is the most important for recognizing emotion",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Competitive Self-Play (CSP) have achieved, or even surpassed, human level performance in complex game environments such as Dota 2 and StarCraft II using Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). One core component of these methods relies on creating a pool of learning agents -- consisting of the Main Agent, past versions of this agent, and Exploiter Agents -- where Exploiter Agents learn counter-strategies to the Main Agents. A key drawback of these approaches is the large computational cost and physical time that is required to train the system, making them impractical to deploy in highly iterative real-life settings such as video game productions. In this paper, we propose the Minimax Exploiter, a game theoretic approach to exploiting Main Agents that leverages knowledge of its opponents, leading to significant increases in data efficiency. We validate our approach in a diversity of settings, including simple turn based games, the arcade learning environment, and For Honor, a modern video game. The Minimax Exploiter consistently outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating improved stability and data efficiency, leading to a robust CSP-MARL method that is both flexible and easy to deploy",

However, extracting relevant and meaningful characteristics of a location can be challenging, often entailing expensive data fusion or data distillation from global imagery datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce Satellite Contrastive Location-Image Pretraining (SatCLIP), a global, general-purpose geographic location encoder that learns an implicit representation of locations from openly available satellite imagery. Trained location encoders provide vector embeddings summarizing the characteristics of any given location for convenient usage in diverse downstream tasks. We show that SatCLIP embeddings, pretrained on globally sampled multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite data, can be used in various predictive tasks that depend on location information but not necessarily satellite imagery, including temperature prediction, animal recognition in imagery, and population density estimation. Across tasks, SatCLIP embeddings consistently outperform embeddings from existing pretrained location encoders, ranging from models trained on natural images to models trained on semantic context. SatCLIP embeddings also help to improve geographic generalization. This demonstrates the potential of general-purpose location encoders and opens the door to learning meaningful representations of our planet from the vast, varied, and largely untapped modalities of geospatial data",

    "abstract": "TodevelopanovelUncertaintyQuantification (UQ) framework to estimate the uncertainty of patient survival models in the absence of ground truth, we developed and evaluated our approach based on a dataset of 1383 patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for brain metastases between January 2015 and December 2020. Our motivating hypothesis is that a time-to-event prediction of a test patient on inference is more certain given a higher feature-space-similarity to patients in the training set. Therefore, the uncertainty for a particular patient-of-interest is represented by the concordance index between a patient similarity rank and a prediction similarity rank. Model uncertainty was defined as the increased percentage of the max uncertainty-constrained-AUC compared to the model AUC. We evaluated our method on multiple clinically-relevant endpoints, including time to intracranial progression (ICP), progression-free survival (PFS) after SRS, overall survival (OS), and time to ICP and/or death (ICPD), on a variety of both statistical and non-statistical models, including CoxPH, conditional survival forest (CSF), and neural multi-task linear regression (NMTLR). Our results show that all models had the lowest uncertainty on ICP (2.21%) and the highest uncertainty (17.28%) on ICPD. OS models demonstrated high variation in uncertainty performance, where NMTLR had the lowest uncertainty(1.96%)and CSF had the highest uncertainty (14.29%). In conclusion, our method can estimate the uncertainty of individual patient survival modeling results. As expected, our data empirically demonstrate that as model uncertainty measured via our technique increases, the similarity between a feature-space and its predicted outcome decreases",

    "abstract": "The concept of rationality is central to the field of artificial intelligence. Whether we are seeking to simulate human reasoning, or the goal is to achieve bounded optimality, we generally seek to make artificial agents as rational as possible. Despite the centrality of the concept within AI, there is no unified definition of what constitutes a rational agent. This article provides a survey of rationality and irrationality in artificial intelligence, and sets out the open questions in this area. The understanding of rationality in other fields has influenced its conception within artificial intelligence, in particular work in economics, philosophy and psychology. Focusing on the behaviour of artificial agents, we consider irrational behaviours that can prove to be optimal in certain scenarios. Some methods have been developed to deal with irrational agents, both in terms of identification and interaction, however work in this area remains limited. Methods that have up to now been developed for other purposes, namely adversarial scenarios, may be adapted to suit interactions with artificial agents. We further discuss the interplay between human and artificial agents, and the role that rationality plays within this interaction; many questions remain in this area, relating to potentially irrational behaviour of both humans and artificial agents",

We argue that this question cannot be answered from the X-ray alone and requires a pragmatic perspective, which captures the communicative goal that radiology reports serve between radiologists and patients. However, the standard image-to-text formulation for radiology report generation fails to incorporate such pragmatic intents. Following this pragmatic perspective, we demonstrate that the indication, which describes why a patient comes for an X-ray, drives the mentions of negative observations and introduce indications as additional input to report generation. With respect to the output, we develop a framework to identify uninferable information from the image as a source of model hallucinations, and limit them by cleaning groundtruth reports. Finally, we use indications and cleaned groundtruth reports to develop pragmatic models, and show that they outperform existing methods not only in new pragmatics-inspired metrics (+4.3 Negative F1) but also in standard metrics (+6.3 Positive F1 and +11.0 BLEU-2)",

To meet this demand, we present the first method of predicting the age of transients in real-time from multi-wavelength time-series observations.

We consider robots with unknown stochastic dynamics operating in environments with unknown geometric structure. The robots are equipped with sensors allowing them to detect obstacles. Our goal is to synthesize a control policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying an LTL-encoded task in the presence of motion and environmental uncertainty. Several deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have been proposed recently to address similar problems. A common limitation in related works is that of slow learning performance. In order to address this issue, we propose a novel DRL algorithm, which has the capability to learn control policies at a notably faster rate compared to similar methods. Its sample efficiency is due to a mission-driven exploration strategy that prioritizes exploration towards directions that may contribute to mission accomplishment. Identifying these directions relies on an automaton representation of the LTL task as well as a learned neural network that (partially) models the unknown system dynamics.

    "abstract": "In this paper we tackle the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). Specifically, given a dataset with labelled and unlabelled images, the task is to cluster all images in the unlabelled subset, whether or not they belong to the labelled categories. Our first contribution is to recognize that most existing GCD benchmarks only contain labels for a single clustering of the data, making it difficult to ascertain whether models are using the available labels to solve the GCD task, or simply solving an unsupervised clustering problem. As such, we present a synthetic dataset, named 'Clevr-4', for category discovery. Clevr-4 contains four equally valid partitions of the data, i.e based on object shape, texture, color or count. To solve the task, models are required to extrapolate the taxonomy specified by the labelled set, rather than simply latching onto a single natural grouping of the data. We use this dataset to demonstrate the limitations of unsupervised clustering in the GCD setting, showing that even very strong unsupervised models fail on Clevr-4. We further use Clevr-4 to examine the weaknesses of existing GCD algorithms, and propose a new method which addresses these shortcomings, leveraging consistent findings from the representation learning literature to do so. Our simple solution, which is based on 'mean teachers' and termed $\\mu$GCD, substantially outperforms implemented baselines on Clevr-4. Finally, when we transfer these findings to real data on the challenging Semantic Shift Benchmark (SSB), we find that $\\mu$GCD outperforms all prior work, setting a new state-of-the-art.

We then show that prequalified generated images can be identified reliably by classifiers that only look at geometric properties. We use three such classifiers. All three classifiers are denied access to image pixels, and look only at derived geometric features. The first classifier looks at the perspective field of the image, the second looks at lines detected in the image, and the third looks at relations between detected objects and shadows. Our procedure detects generated images more reliably than SOTA local signal based detectors, for images from a number of distinct generators. Saliency maps suggest that the classifiers can identify geometric problems reliably. We conclude that current generators cannot reliably reproduce geometric properties of real images",

Our method employs a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of key feature maps, with newly learned parameters that make up less than 0.6% of the total parameters in the generative model. Optimized with a small set of labeled images, our model-agnostic approach adapts to various generative architectures, including Diffusion models, GANs, and Autoregressive models.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Nature evolves creatures with a high complexity of morphological and behavioral intelligence, meanwhile computational methods lag in approaching that diversity and efficacy. Co-optimization of artificial creatures' morphology and control in silico shows promise for applications in physical soft robotics and virtual character creation; such approaches, however, require developing new learning algorithms that can reason about function atop pure structure. In this paper, we present DiffuseBot, a physics-augmented diffusion model that generates soft robot morphologies capable of excelling in a wide spectrum of tasks. DiffuseBot bridges the gap between virtually generated content and physical utility by (i) augmenting the diffusion process with a physical dynamical simulation which provides a certificate of performance, and (ii) introducing a co-design procedure that jointly optimizes physical design and control by leveraging information about physical sensitivities from differentiable simulation. We showcase a range of simulated and fabricated robots along with their capabilities. Check our website at https://diffusebot.github.io/",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Contrastive pretraining of image-text foundation models, such as CLIP, demonstrated excellent zero-shot performance and improved robustness on a wide range of downstream tasks. However, these models utilize large transformer-based encoders with significant memory and latency overhead which pose challenges for deployment on mobile devices. In this work, we introduce MobileCLIP -- a new family of efficient image-text models optimized for runtime performance along with a novel and efficient training approach, namely multi-modal reinforced training. The proposed training approach leverages knowledge transfer from an image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP encoders to improve the accuracy of efficient models. Our approach avoids train-time compute overhead by storing the additional knowledge in a reinforced dataset. MobileCLIP sets a new state-of-the-art latency-accuracy tradeoff for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks on several datasets. Our MobileCLIP-S2 variant is 2.3$\\times$ faster while more accurate compared to previous best CLIP model based on ViT-B/16. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-modal reinforced training by training a CLIP model based on ViT-B/16 image backbone and achieving +2.9% average performance improvement on 38 evaluation benchmarks compared to the previous best. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach achieves 10$\\times$-1000$\\times$ improved learning efficiency when compared with non-reinforced CLIP training",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning (MRL) is a powerful tool for bridging the gap between machine learning and chemical sciences, as it converts molecules into numerical representations while preserving their chemical features. These encoded representations serve as a foundation for various downstream biochemical studies, including property prediction and drug design. MRL has had great success with proteins and general biomolecule datasets. Yet, in the growing sub-field of glycoscience (the study of carbohydrates, where longer carbohydrates are also called glycans), MRL methods have been barely explored. This under-exploration can be primarily attributed to the limited availability of comprehensive and well-curated carbohydrate-specific datasets and a lack of Machine learning (ML) pipelines specifically tailored to meet the unique problems presented by carbohydrate data. Since interpreting and annotating carbohydrate-specific data is generally more complicated than protein data, domain experts are usually required to get involved. The existing MRL methods, predominately optimized for proteins and small biomolecules, also cannot be directly used in carbohydrate applications without special modifications. To address this challenge, accelerate progress in glycoscience, and enrich the data resources of the MRL community, we introduce GlycoNMR. GlycoNMR contains two laboriously curated datasets with 2,609 carbohydrate structures and 211,543 annotated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts for precise atomic-level prediction. We tailored carbohydrate-specific features and adapted existing MRL models to tackle this problem effectively. For illustration, we benchmark four modified MRL models on our new datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand model behaviors in terms of specific, interpretable features, often hypothesized to manifest as low-dimensional subspaces of activations. Specifically, recent studies have explored subspace interventions (such as activation patching) as a way to simultaneously manipulate model behavior and attribute the features behind it to given subspaces. In this work, we demonstrate that these two aims diverge, potentially leading to an illusory sense of interpretability. Counterintuitively, even if a subspace intervention makes the model's output behave as if the value of a feature was changed, this effect may be achieved by activating a dormant parallel pathway leveraging another subspace that is causally disconnected from model outputs. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a distilled mathematical example, in two real-world domains (the indirect object identification task and factual recall), and present evidence for its prevalence in practice. In the context of factual recall, we further show a link to rank-1 fact editing, providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing an inconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localization. However, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces is intrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, we also show what a success case looks like in a task (indirect object identification) where prior manual circuit analysis informs an understanding of the location of a feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to argue that a patched subspace is faithful",

This paper investigates this alternative technique for recognizing illegal activities from images. In particular, we investigate label-agnostic learning techniques like One-Shot and Few-Shot learning featuring the use Siamese neural networks, a state-of-the-art approach in the field. Our solution manages to handle small-scale datasets with promising accuracy. In particular, Siamese neural networks reach 90.9% on 20-Shot experiments over a 10-class dataset; this leads us to conclude that such models are a promising and cheaper alternative to the definition of automated law-enforcing machinery over the dark web",

    "title": "Computational Hypergraph Discovery, a Gaussian Process framework for connecting the dots",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Most scientific challenges can be framed into one of the following three levels of complexity of function approximation. Type 1: Approximate an unknown function given input/output data. Type 2: Consider a collection of variables and functions, some of which are unknown, indexed by the nodes and hyperedges of a hypergraph (a generalized graph where edges can connect more than two vertices). Given partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph (satisfying the functional dependencies imposed by its structure), approximate all the unobserved variables and unknown functions. Type 3: Expanding on Type 2, if the hypergraph structure itself is unknown, use partial observations of the variables of the hypergraph to discover its structure and approximate its unknown functions. While most Computational Science and Engineering and Scientific Machine Learning challenges can be framed as Type 1 and Type 2 problems, many scientific problems can only be categorized as Type 3. Despite their prevalence, these Type 3 challenges have been largely overlooked due to their inherent complexity. Although Gaussian Process (GP) methods are sometimes perceived as well-founded but old technology limited to Type 1 curve fitting, their scope has recently been expanded to Type 2 problems. In this paper, we introduce an interpretable GP framework for Type 3 problems, targeting the data-driven discovery and completion of computational hypergraphs. Our approach is based on a kernel generalization of Row Echelon Form reduction from linear systems to nonlinear ones and variance-based analysis. Here, variables are linked via GPs and those contributing to the highest data variance unveil the hypergraph's structure. We illustrate the scope and efficiency of the proposed approach with applications to (algebraic) equation discovery, network discovery (gene pathways, chemical, and mechanical) and raw data analysis",

    "title": "An Investigation of Time Reversal Symmetry in Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges associated with reinforcement learning (RL) is that collecting sufficient data can be both time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we formalize a concept of time reversal symmetry in a Markov decision process (MDP), which builds upon the established structure of dynamically reversible Markov chains (DRMCs) and time-reversibility in classical physics. Specifically, we investigate the utility of this concept in reducing the sample complexity of reinforcement learning. We observe that utilizing the structure of time reversal in an MDP allows every environment transition experienced by an agent to be transformed into a feasible reverse-time transition, effectively doubling the number of experiences in the environment. To test the usefulness of this newly synthesized data, we develop a novel approach called time symmetric data augmentation (TSDA) and investigate its application in both proprioceptive and pixel-based state within the realm of off-policy, model-free RL. Empirical evaluations showcase how these synthetic transitions can enhance the sample efficiency of RL agents in time reversible scenarios without friction or contact. We also test this method in more realistic environments where these assumptions are not globally satisfied. We find that TSDA can significantly degrade sample efficiency and policy performance, but can also improve sample efficiency under the right conditions. Ultimately we conclude that time symmetry shows promise in enhancing the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning and provide guidance when the environment and reward structures are of an appropriate form for TSDA to be employed effectively",

These methods may be referred to as Dynamical Variational Autoencoders, and our specific focus lies on the deep Kalman filter. It has been shown that the ELBO objective can oversimplify data representations, potentially compromising estimation quality. Tighter Monte Carlo objectives have been proposed in the literature to enhance generative modeling performance. For instance, the IWAE objective uses importance weights to reduce the variance of marginal log-likelihood estimates. In this paper, importance sampling is applied to the DKF framework for learning deep Markov models, resulting in the IW-DKF, which shows an improvement in terms of log-likelihood estimates and KL divergence between the variational distribution and the transition model. The framework using the sampled DKF update rule is also accommodated to address sequential state and parameter estimation when working with highly non-linear physics-based models. An experiment with the 3-space Lorenz attractor shows an enhanced generative modeling performance and also a decrease in RMSE when estimating the model parameters and latent states, indicating that tighter MCOs lead to improved state inference performance",

We find that conventional goal-conditioned reinforcement learning approaches for extracting a value function and policy fall short in this difficult offline setting. By analyzing the geometry of optimal goal-conditioned value functions, we relate this issue to a specific class of estimation artifacts in learned values. In order to mitigate their occurrence, we propose to combine model-based planning over learned value landscapes with a graph-based value aggregation scheme.

Indeed, data sharing is often not feasible due to privacy considerations related to data leaving the original collection centers, along with pharmaceutical companies' competitive motives. In this paper, we leverage a privacy-enhancing technology called federated learning (FL) to remove some of the barriers to data sharing. We introduce a federated learning inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method for time-to-event outcomes called FedECA which eases the implementation of ECA by limiting patients' data exposure. We show with extensive experiments that FedECA outperforms its closest competitor, matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), in terms of statistical power and ability to balance the treatment and control groups.

    "abstract": "Most existing debiasing methods for multimodal models, including causal intervention and inference methods, utilize approximate heuristics to represent the biases, such as shallow features from early stages of training or unimodal features for multimodal tasks like VQA, etc., which may not be accurate. In this paper, we study bias arising from confounders in a causal graph for multimodal data and examine a novel approach that leverages causally-motivated information minimization to learn the confounder representations. Robust predictive features contain diverse information that helps a model generalize to out-of-distribution data. Hence, minimizing the information content of features obtained from a pretrained biased model helps learn the simplest predictive features that capture the underlying data distribution. We treat these features as confounder representations and use them via methods motivated by causal theory to remove bias from models. We find that the learned confounder representations indeed capture dataset biases, and the proposed debiasing methods improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on multiple multimodal datasets without sacrificing in-distribution performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric to quantify the sufficiency of spurious features in models' predictions that further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The rise of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to an increase in model size and complexity, straining the memory capacity of GPUs. Sparsity in DNNs, characterized as structural or ephemeral, has gained attention as a solution. This work focuses on ephemeral sparsity, aiming to reduce memory consumption during training. It emphasizes the significance of activations, an often overlooked component, and their role in memory usage. This work employs structured pruning in Block Sparse Compressed Row (BSR) format in combination with a magnitude-based criterion to efficiently prune activations. We furthermore introduce efficient block-sparse operators for GPUs and showcase their effectiveness, as well as the superior compression offered by block sparsity. We report the effectiveness of activation pruning by evaluating training speed, accuracy, and memory usage of large-scale neural architectures on the example of ResMLP on image classification tasks. As a result, we observe a memory reduction of up to 32\\% while maintaining accuracy. Ultimately, our approach aims to democratize large-scale model training, reduce GPU requirements, and address ecological concerns",

Pre-existing works focus predominantly on text-based instructions to achieve desired image modifications, which limit edit precision and accuracy. In this work, we propose an inference-time editing optimisation, designed to extend beyond textual edits to accommodate multiple editing instruction types (e.g. spatial layout-based; pose, scribbles, edge maps). We propose to disentangle the editing task into two competing subtasks: successful local image modifications and global content consistency preservation, where subtasks are guided through two dedicated loss functions. By allowing to adjust the influence of each loss function, we build a flexible editing solution that can be adjusted to user preferences. We evaluate our method using text, pose and scribble edit conditions, and highlight our ability to achieve complex edits, through both qualitative and quantitative experiments",

    "title": "Digital Twin-Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Management in Networks Slicing",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Network slicing-based communication systems can dynamically and efficiently allocate resources for diversified services. However, due to the limitation of the network interface on channel access and the complexity of the resource allocation, it is challenging to achieve an acceptable solution in the practical system without precise prior knowledge of the dynamics probability model of the service requests. Existing work attempts to solve this problem using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), however, such methods usually require a lot of interaction with the real environment in order to achieve good results. In this paper, a framework consisting of a digital twin and reinforcement learning agents is present to handle the issue. Specifically, we propose to use the historical data and the neural networks to build a digital twin model to simulate the state variation law of the real environment. Then, we use the data generated by the network slicing environment to calibrate the digital twin so that it is in sync with the real environment. Finally, DRL for slice optimization optimizes its own performance in this virtual pre-verification environment. We conducted an exhaustive verification of the proposed digital twin framework to confirm its scalability. Specifically, we propose to use loss landscapes to visualize the generalization of DRL solutions. We explore a distillation-based optimization scheme for lightweight slicing strategies. In addition, we also extend the framework to offline reinforcement learning, where solutions can be used to obtain intelligent decisions based solely on historical data. Numerical simulation experiments show that the proposed digital twin can significantly improve the performance of the slice optimization strategy",

We show that existing proposals for nearest neighbour weighting can be standardised in the form of kernel functions, applied to the distance values and/or ranks of the nearest neighbours of a test instance. Furthermore, we identify three commonly used distance functions and four scaling measures. We systematically evaluate these choices on a collection of 85 real-life classification datasets. We find that NN, FNN and FRNN all perform best with Boscovich distance. NN and FRNN perform best with a combination of Samworth rank- and distance weights and scaling by the mean absolute deviation around the median ($r_1$), the standard deviaton ($r_2$) or the interquartile range ($r_{\\infty}^*$), while FNN performs best with only Samworth distance-weights and $r_1$- or $r_2$-scaling. We also introduce a new kernel based on fuzzy Yager negation, and show that NN achieves comparable performance with Yager distance-weights, which are simpler to implement than a combination of Samworth distance- and rank-weights. Finally, we demonstrate that FRNN generally outperforms NN, which in turns performs systematically better than FNN",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in the popularity of commercial AI products based on generative, multi-purpose AI systems promising a unified approach to building machine learning (ML) models into technology. However, this ambition of \"generality\" comes at a steep cost to the environment, given the amount of energy these systems require and the amount of carbon that they emit. In this work, we propose the first systematic comparison of the ongoing inference cost of various categories of ML systems, covering both task-specific (i.e. finetuned models that carry out a single task) and `general-purpose' models, (i.e. those trained for multiple tasks). We measure deployment cost as the amount of energy and carbon required to perform 1,000 inferences on representative benchmark dataset using these models. We find that multi-purpose, generative architectures are orders of magnitude more expensive than task-specific systems for a variety of tasks, even when controlling for the number of model parameters. We conclude with a discussion around the current trend of deploying multi-purpose generative ML systems, and caution that their utility should be more intentionally weighed against increased costs in terms of energy and emissions.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained significant popularity for classification tasks in machine learning, yet their applications to regression problems remain limited. Concurrently, attention mechanisms have emerged as powerful tools in sequential learning tasks. In this paper, we employ GNNs and attention mechanisms to address a classical but challenging nonlinear regression problem: network localization. We propose a novel GNN-based network localization method that achieves exceptional stability and accuracy in the presence of severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagations, while eliminating the need for laborious offline calibration or NLOS identification. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness and high accuracy of our GNN-based localization model, particularly in challenging NLOS scenarios. However, the proposed GNN-based model exhibits limited flexibility, and its accuracy is highly sensitive to a specific hyperparameter that determines the graph structure. To address the limitations and extend the applicability of the GNN-based model to real scenarios, we introduce two attentional graph neural networks (AGNNs) that offer enhanced flexibility and the ability to automatically learn the optimal hyperparameter for each node. Experimental results confirm that the AGNN models are able to enhance localization accuracy, providing a promising solution for real-world applications. We also provide some analyses of the improved performance achieved by the AGNN models from the perspectives of dynamic attention and signal denoising characteristics",

    "title": "Identifiable Feature Learning for Spatial Data with Nonlinear ICA",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, nonlinear ICA has surfaced as a popular alternative to the many heuristic models used in deep representation learning and disentanglement. An advantage of nonlinear ICA is that a sophisticated identifiability theory has been developed; in particular, it has been proven that the original components can be recovered under sufficiently strong latent dependencies. Despite this general theory, practical nonlinear ICA algorithms have so far been mainly limited to data with one-dimensional latent dependencies, especially time-series data. In this paper, we introduce a new nonlinear ICA framework that employs $t$-process (TP) latent components which apply naturally to data with higher-dimensional dependency structures, such as spatial and spatio-temporal data. In particular, we develop a new learning and inference algorithm that extends variational inference methods to handle the combination of a deep neural network mixing function with the TP prior, and employs the method of inducing points for computational efficacy. On the theoretical side, we show that such TP independent components are identifiable under very general conditions. Further, Gaussian Process (GP) nonlinear ICA is established as a limit of the TP Nonlinear ICA model, and we prove that the identifiability of the latent components at this GP limit is more restricted. Namely, those components are identifiable if and only if they have distinctly different covariance kernels. Our algorithm and identifiability theorems are explored on simulated spatial data and real world spatio-temporal data",

A recurrent neural network learns the temporal dependencies in the data while an attention-based feature selection component selects the most relevant features and suppresses redundant features used in the learning of the temporal dependencies. A modular deep network is trained from the selected features independently to show the users how features influence outcomes, making the model interpretable. Experimental results show that this approach can outperform state-of-the-art interpretable Neural Additive Models (NAM) and variations thereof in both regression and classification of time series tasks, achieving a predictive performance that is comparable to the top non-interpretable methods for time series, LSTM and XGBoost",

For this reason, this work provides a thorough theoretical and empirical comparison between methods by evaluating them in terms of memory usage, speed, and certifiable robust accuracy.

Each distortion changes the original signal in different ways, e.g., additive or multiplicative noise. We propose a transformer-based model to explicitly learn this decomposition. The sequential model uses 3D Swin-Transformers for spatio-temporal encoding and 3D U-Nets as prediction heads for individual parts of the decomposition.

We empirically study this self-consuming training loop using a novel dataset to analytically and accurately measure quality and diversity of generated outputs. We find that this self-consuming training loop initially improves both quality and diversity. However, after a few generations the output inevitably degenerates in diversity.

Prior works have shown that training on synthetic images improves many perception tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. We are the first to explore generative data augmentations for scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. We propose a generative data augmentation method that leverages a ControlNet diffusion model conditioned on semantic scribbles to produce high-quality training data. However, naive implementations of generative data augmentations may inadvertently harm the performance of the downstream segmentor rather than improve it. We leverage classifier-free diffusion guidance to enforce class consistency and introduce encode ratios to trade off data diversity for data realism. Using the guidance scale and encode ratio, we are able to generate a spectrum of high-quality training images. We propose multiple augmentation schemes and find that these schemes significantly impact model performance, especially in the low-data regime. Our framework further reduces the gap between the performance of scribble-supervised segmentation and that of fully-supervised segmentation.

Through collaboration, they (3) increase the scope of SLO fulfillment. We implemented the framework and evaluated a use case in which a CC system is responsible for ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) during video streaming.

Here, we address a fundamental challenge with selective classification during automated diagnosis with domain-shifted medical images. In this scenario, models must learn to avoid making predictions when label confidence is low, especially when tested with samples far removed from the training set (covariate shift). Such uncertain cases are typically referred to the clinician for further analysis and evaluation. Yet, we show that even state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches fail severely during referral when tested on medical images acquired from a different demographic or using a different technology. We examine two benchmark diagnostic medical imaging datasets exhibiting strong covariate shifts: i) diabetic retinopathy prediction with retinal fundus images and ii) multilabel disease prediction with chest X-ray images. We show that predictive uncertainty estimates do not generalize well under covariate shifts leading to non-monotonic referral curves, and severe drops in performance (up to 50%) at high referral rates (>70%). We evaluate novel combinations of robust generalization and post hoc referral approaches, that rescue these failures and achieve significant performance improvements, typically >10%, over baseline methods.

In this work, we study sluggish and chemically-biased interstitial diffusion in Fe-Ni concentrated solid solution alloys (CSAs) by combining machine learning (ML) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC), where ML is used to accurately and efficiently predict the migration energy barriers on-the-fly. The ML-kMC reproduces the diffusivity that was reported by molecular dynamics results at high temperatures. With this powerful tool, we find that the observed sluggish diffusion and the \"Ni-Ni-Ni\"-biased diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys are ascribed to a unique \"Barrier Lock\" mechanism, whereas the \"Fe-Fe-Fe\"-biased diffusion is influenced by a \"Component Dominance\" mechanism. Inspired by the mentioned mechanisms, a practical AvgS-kMC method is proposed for conveniently and swiftly determining interstitial-mediated diffusivity by only relying on the mean energy barriers of migration patterns. Combining the AvgS-kMC with the differential evolutionary algorithm, an inverse design strategy for optimizing sluggish diffusion properties is applied to emphasize the crucial role of favorable migration patterns",

    "title": "LEDITS++: Limitless Image Editing using Text-to-Image Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have recently received increasing interest for their astonishing ability to produce high-fidelity images from solely text inputs. Subsequent research efforts aim to exploit and apply their capabilities to real image editing. However, existing image-to-image methods are often inefficient, imprecise, and of limited versatility. They either require time-consuming fine-tuning, deviate unnecessarily strongly from the input image, and/or lack support for multiple, simultaneous edits. To address these issues, we introduce LEDITS++, an efficient yet versatile and precise textual image manipulation technique. LEDITS++'s novel inversion approach requires no tuning nor optimization and produces high-fidelity results with a few diffusion steps. Second, our methodology supports multiple simultaneous edits and is architecture-agnostic. Third, we use a novel implicit masking technique that limits changes to relevant image regions. We propose the novel TEdBench++ benchmark as part of our exhaustive evaluation. Our results demonstrate the capabilities of LEDITS++ and its improvements over previous methods.

    "title": "Sinkhorn Flow: A Continuous-Time Framework for Understanding and Generalizing the Sinkhorn Algorithm",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Many problems in machine learning can be formulated as solving entropy-regularized optimal transport on the space of probability measures. The canonical approach involves the Sinkhorn iterates, renowned for their rich mathematical properties. Recently, the Sinkhorn algorithm has been recast within the mirror descent framework, thus benefiting from classical optimization theory insights. Here, we build upon this result by introducing a continuous-time analogue of the Sinkhorn algorithm. This perspective allows us to derive novel variants of Sinkhorn schemes that are robust to noise and bias. Moreover, our continuous-time dynamics not only generalize but also offer a unified perspective on several recently discovered dynamics in machine learning and mathematics, such as the \"Wasserstein mirror flow\" of (Deb et al. 2023) or the \"mean-field Schr\\\"odinger equation\" of (Claisse et al. 2023)",

    "title": "Rethinking Intermediate Layers design in Knowledge Distillation for Kidney and Liver Tumor Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation(KD) has demonstrated remarkable success across various domains, but its application to medical imaging tasks, such as kidney and liver tumor segmentation, has encountered challenges. Many existing KD methods are not specifically tailored for these tasks. Moreover, prevalent KD methods often lack a careful consideration of what and from where to distill knowledge from the teacher to the student. This oversight may lead to issues like the accumulation of training bias within shallower student layers, potentially compromising the effectiveness of KD. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Layer-selective Feedback Distillation (HLFD). HLFD strategically distills knowledge from a combination of middle layers to earlier layers and transfers final layer knowledge to intermediate layers at both the feature and pixel levels. This design allows the model to learn higher-quality representations from earlier layers, resulting in a robust and compact student model. Extensive quantitative evaluations reveal that HLFD outperforms existing methods by a significant margin. For example, in the kidney segmentation task, HLFD surpasses the student model (without KD) by over 10pp, significantly improving its focus on tumor-specific features. From a qualitative standpoint, the student model trained using HLFD excels at suppressing irrelevant information and can focus sharply on tumor-specific details, which opens a new pathway for more efficient and accurate diagnostic tools",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of mobile technology, Point of Interest (POI) recommendation systems in Location-based Social Networks (LBSN) have brought numerous benefits to both users and companies. Many existing works employ Knowledge Graph (KG) to alleviate the data sparsity issue in LBSN. These approaches primarily focus on modeling the pair-wise relations in LBSN to enrich the semantics and thereby relieve the data sparsity issue. However, existing approaches seldom consider the hyper-relations in LBSN, such as the mobility relation (a 3-ary relation: user-POI-time). This makes the model hard to exploit the semantics accurately. In addition, prior works overlook the rich structural information inherent in KG, which consists of higher-order relations and can further alleviate the impact of data sparsity.To this end, we propose a Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph Neural Network (HKGNN) model. In HKGNN, a Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graph (HKG) that models the LBSN data is constructed to maintain and exploit the rich semantics of hyper-relations. Then we proposed a Hypergraph Neural Network to utilize the structural information of HKG in a cohesive way. In addition, a self-attention network is used to leverage sequential information and make personalized recommendations. Furthermore, side information, essential in reducing data sparsity by providing background knowledge of POIs, is not fully utilized in current methods. In light of this, we extended the current dataset with available side information to further lessen the impact of data sparsity. Results of experiments on four real-world LBSN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods",

PyGHO's main objective is to provide an unified and user-friendly interface for various HOGNNs. It accomplishes this through streamlined data structures for node tuples, comprehensive data processing utilities, and a flexible suite of operators for high-order GNN methodologies. In this work, we present a detailed in-depth of PyGHO and compare HOGNNs implemented with PyGHO with their official implementation on real-world tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The quest for accurate prediction of drug molecule properties poses a fundamental challenge in the realm of Artificial Intelligence Drug Discovery (AIDD). An effective representation of drug molecules emerges as a pivotal component in this pursuit. Contemporary leading-edge research predominantly resorts to self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques to extract meaningful structural representations from large-scale, unlabeled molecular data, subsequently fine-tuning these representations for an array of downstream tasks. However, an inherent shortcoming of these studies lies in their singular reliance on one modality of molecular information, such as molecule image or SMILES representations, thus neglecting the potential complementarity of various molecular modalities. In response to this limitation, we propose MolIG, a novel MultiModaL molecular pre-training framework for predicting molecular properties based on Image and Graph structures. MolIG model innovatively leverages the coherence and correlation between molecule graph and molecule image to execute self-supervised tasks, effectively amalgamating the strengths of both molecular representation forms. This holistic approach allows for the capture of pivotal molecular structural characteristics and high-level semantic information. Upon completion of pre-training, Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder is used for the prediction of downstream tasks. In comparison to advanced baseline models, MolIG exhibits enhanced performance in downstream tasks pertaining to molecular property prediction within benchmark groups such as MoleculeNet Benchmark Group and ADMET Benchmark Group",

Existing SBI methods either approximate the likelihood, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or directly model the posterior, such as Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE). While ABC is efficient on low-dimensional problems, on higher-dimensional tasks, it is generally outperformed by SNPE, which leverages function approximation. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Likelihood Inference (PLI), a new method that brings neural approximation into ABC, making it competitive on challenging Bayesian system identification tasks. By utilizing integral probability metrics, we introduce a smooth likelihood kernel with an adaptive bandwidth that is updated based on information-theoretic trust regions. Thanks to this formulation, our method (i) allows for optimizing neural posteriors via gradient descent, (ii) does not rely on summary statistics, and (iii) enables multiple observations as input. In comparison to SNPE, it leads to improved performance when more data is available. The effectiveness of PLI is evaluated on four classical SBI benchmark tasks and on a highly dynamic physical system, showing particular advantages on stochastic simulations and multi-modal posterior landscapes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Missing data are frequently observed by practitioners and researchers in the building energy modeling community. In this regard, advanced data-driven solutions, such as Deep Learning methods, are typically required to reflect the non-linear behavior of these anomalies. As an ongoing research question related to Deep Learning, a model's applicability to limited data settings can be explored by introducing prior knowledge in the network. This same strategy can also lead to more interpretable predictions, hence facilitating the field application of the approach. For that purpose, the aim of this paper is to propose the use of Physics-informed Denoising Autoencoders (PI-DAE) for missing data imputation in commercial buildings. In particular, the presented method enforces physics-inspired soft constraints to the loss function of a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE). In order to quantify the benefits of the physical component, an ablation study between different DAE configurations is conducted. First, three univariate DAEs are optimized separately on indoor air temperature, heating, and cooling data. Then, two multivariate DAEs are derived from the previous configurations. Eventually, a building thermal balance equation is coupled to the last multivariate configuration to obtain PI-DAE. Additionally, two commonly used benchmarks are employed to support the findings. It is shown how introducing physical knowledge in a multivariate Denoising Autoencoder can enhance the inherent model interpretability through the optimized physics-based coefficients. While no significant improvement is observed in terms of reconstruction error with the proposed PI-DAE, its enhanced robustness to varying rates of missing data and the valuable insights derived from the physics-based coefficients create opportunities for wider applications within building systems and the built environment",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the evolving landscape of data science, the accurate quantification of clustering in high-dimensional data sets remains a significant challenge, especially in the absence of predefined labels. This paper introduces a novel approach, the Entropy of Distance Distribution (EDD), which represents a paradigm shift in label-free clustering analysis. Traditional methods, reliant on discrete labels, often struggle to discern intricate cluster patterns in unlabeled data. EDD, however, leverages the characteristic differences in pairwise point-to-point distances to discern clustering tendencies, independent of data labeling. Our method employs the Shannon information entropy to quantify the 'peakedness' or 'flatness' of distance distributions in a data set. This entropy measure, normalized against its maximum value, effectively distinguishes between strongly clustered data (indicated by pronounced peaks in distance distribution) and more homogeneous, non-clustered data sets. This label-free quantification is resilient against global translations and permutations of data points, and with an additional dimension-wise z-scoring, it becomes invariant to data set scaling. We demonstrate the efficacy of EDD through a series of experiments involving two-dimensional data spaces with Gaussian cluster centers. Our findings reveal a monotonic increase in the EDD value with the widening of cluster widths, moving from well-separated to overlapping clusters. This behavior underscores the method's sensitivity and accuracy in detecting varying degrees of clustering. EDD's potential extends beyond conventional clustering analysis, offering a robust, scalable tool for unraveling complex data structures without reliance on pre-assigned labels",

We identify that two key principles for long-range tasks are (i) incorporating an inductive bias towards smoothness, and (ii) locality. As we show, integrating these ideas into the attention mechanism improves results with a negligible amount of additional computation and without any additional trainable parameters.

This oversight could lead to loss of information and clustering results that lack clinical significance. To address this limitation, we develop an advanced single-cell clustering model incorporating dual-graph alignment, which integrates gene network information into the clustering process based on self-supervised and unsupervised optimization. Specifically, we designed a graph-based autoencoder enhanced by an attention mechanism to effectively capture relationships between cells. Moreover, we performed the node2vec method on Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks to derive the gene network structure and maintained this structure throughout the clustering process. Our proposed method has been demonstrated to be effective through experimental results, showcasing its ability to optimize clustering outcomes while preserving the original associations between cells and genes.

Machine learning approaches for counterfactual reasoning have to deal with both unobserved outcomes and distributional differences due to non-random treatment administration. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses similar issues; one has to deal with unobserved outcomes -- the labels of the target domain -- and distributional differences between source and target domain. We propose Adversarial Distribution Balancing for Counterfactual Reasoning (ADBCR), which directly uses potential outcome estimates of the counterfactuals to remove spurious causal relations. We show that ADBCR outcompetes state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that ADBCR's performance can be further improved if unlabeled validation data are included in the training procedure to better adapt the model to the validation domain",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Over the past few years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become powerful and practical tools for learning on (static) graph-structure data. However, many real-world applications, such as social networks and e-commerce, involve temporal graphs where nodes and edges are dynamically evolving. Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have progressively emerged as an extension of GNNs to address time-evolving graphs and have gradually become a trending research topic in both academics and industry. Advancing research in such an emerging field requires new tools to compose TGNN models and unify their different schemes in dealing with temporal graphs. To facilitate research and application in temporal graph learning, we introduce LasTGL, an industrial framework that integrates unified and extensible implementations of common temporal graph learning algorithms for various advanced tasks. The purpose of LasTGL is to provide the essential building blocks for solving temporal graph learning tasks, focusing on the guiding principles of user-friendliness and quick prototyping on which PyTorch is based. In particular, LasTGL provides comprehensive temporal graph datasets, TGNN models and utilities along with well-documented tutorials, making it suitable for both absolute beginners and expert deep learning practitioners alike",

To compensate for artifacts, we propose a generic denoising framework named LC4SV, which can serve as a pre-processor for various unknown downstream SV models. In LC4SV, we employ a learning-based interpolation agent to automatically generate the appropriate coefficients between the enhanced signal and its noisy input to improve SV performance in noisy environments.

    "abstract": "Dynamic systems of graph signals are encountered in various applications, including social networks, power grids, and transportation. While such systems can often be described as state space (SS) models, tracking graph signals via conventional tools based on the Kalman filter (KF) and its variants is typically challenging. This is due to the nonlinearity, high dimensionality, irregularity of the domain, and complex modeling associated with real-world dynamic systems of graph signals. In this work, we study the tracking of graph signals using a hybrid model-based/data-driven approach. We develop the GSP-KalmanNet, which tracks the hidden graphical states from the graphical measurements by jointly leveraging graph signal processing (GSP) tools and deep learning (DL) techniques. The derivations of the GSP-KalmanNet are based on extending the KF to exploit the inherent graph structure via graph frequency domain filtering, which considerably simplifies the computational complexity entailed in processing high-dimensional signals and increases the robustness to small topology changes. Then, we use data to learn the Kalman gain following the recently proposed KalmanNet framework, which copes with partial and approximated modeling, without forcing a specific model over the noise statistics. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed GSP-KalmanNet achieves enhanced accuracy and run time performance as well as improved robustness to model misspecifications compared with both model-based and data-driven benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Single-cell multi-view clustering enables the exploration of cellular heterogeneity within the same cell from different views. Despite the development of several multi-view clustering methods, two primary challenges persist. Firstly, most existing methods treat the information from both single-cell RNA (scRNA) and single-cell Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin (scATAC) views as equally significant, overlooking the substantial disparity in data richness between the two views. This oversight frequently leads to a degradation in overall performance. Additionally, the majority of clustering methods necessitate manual specification of the number of clusters by users. However, for biologists dealing with cell data, precisely determining the number of distinct cell types poses a formidable challenge. To this end, we introduce scUNC, an innovative multi-view clustering approach tailored for single-cell data, which seamlessly integrates information from different views without the need for a predefined number of clusters. The scUNC method comprises several steps: initially, it employs a cross-view fusion network to create an effective embedding, which is then utilized to generate initial clusters via community detection. Subsequently, the clusters are automatically merged and optimized until no further clusters can be merged. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of scUNC using three distinct single-cell datasets. The results underscored that scUNC outperforms the other baseline methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The performance of acoustic models degrades notably in noisy environments. Speech enhancement (SE) can be used as a front-end strategy to aid automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, existing training objectives of SE methods are not fully effective at integrating speech-text and noisy-clean paired data for training toward unseen ASR systems. In this study, we propose a general denoising framework, D4AM, for various downstream acoustic models. Our framework fine-tunes the SE model with the backward gradient according to a specific acoustic model and the corresponding classification objective. In addition, our method aims to consider the regression objective as an auxiliary loss to make the SE model generalize to other unseen acoustic models. To jointly train an SE unit with regression and classification objectives, D4AM uses an adjustment scheme to directly estimate suitable weighting coefficients rather than undergoing a grid search process with additional training costs. The adjustment scheme consists of two parts: gradient calibration and regression objective weighting. The experimental results show that D4AM can consistently and effectively provide improvements to various unseen acoustic models and outperforms other combination setups. Specifically, when evaluated on the Google ASR API with real noisy data completely unseen during SE training, D4AM achieves a relative WER reduction of 24.65% compared with the direct feeding of noisy input. To our knowledge, this is the first work that deploys an effective combination scheme of regression (denoising) and classification (ASR) objectives to derive a general pre-processor applicable to various unseen ASR systems.

    "abstract": "The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly influenced the health and everyday experiences of individuals across the planet. It is a highly contagious respiratory disease requiring early and accurate detection to curb its rapid transmission. Initial testing methods primarily revolved around identifying the genetic composition of the coronavirus, exhibiting a relatively low detection rate and requiring a time-intensive procedure. To address this challenge, experts have suggested using radiological imagery, particularly chest X-rays, as a valuable approach within the diagnostic protocol. This study investigates the potential of leveraging radiographic imaging (X-rays) with deep learning algorithms to swiftly and precisely identify COVID-19 patients. The proposed approach elevates the detection accuracy by fine-tuning with appropriate layers on various established transfer learning models. The experimentation was conducted on a COVID-19 X-ray dataset containing 2000 images. The accuracy rates achieved were impressive of 100% for EfficientNetB4 model. The fine-tuned EfficientNetB4 achieved an excellent accuracy score, showcasing its potential as a robust COVID-19 detection model. Furthermore, EfficientNetB4 excelled in identifying Lung disease using Chest X-ray dataset containing 4,350 Images, achieving remarkable performance with an accuracy of 99.17%, precision of 99.13%, recall of 99.16%, and f1-score of 99.14%. These results highlight the promise of fine-tuned transfer learning for efficient lung detection through medical imaging, especially with X-ray images.

In this paper, we present a novel framework for single-source domain generalization (SSDG) in lane detection. By decomposing data into lane structures and surroundings, we enhance diversity using High-Definition (HD) maps and generative models.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) can enable collaborative learning among distributed clients that have different model architectures and do not share their local data and model parameters with others. Each client updates its local model using the average model output/feature of all client models as the target, known as federated KD. However, existing federated KD methods often do not perform well when clients' local models are trained with heterogeneous local datasets. In this paper, we propose Federated knowledge distillation enabled by Adversarial Learning (FedAL) to address the data heterogeneity among clients. First, to alleviate the local model output divergence across clients caused by data heterogeneity, the server acts as a discriminator to guide clients' local model training to achieve consensus model outputs among clients through a min-max game between clients and the discriminator. Moreover, catastrophic forgetting may happen during the clients' local training and global knowledge transfer due to clients' heterogeneous local data. Towards this challenge, we design the less-forgetting regularization for both local training and global knowledge transfer to guarantee clients' ability to transfer/learn knowledge to/from others. Experimental results show that FedAL and its variants achieve higher accuracy than other federated KD baselines",

Most existing MLC methods are based on the assumption that the correlation of two labels in each label pair is symmetric, which is violated in many real-world scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods design learning processes associated with the number of labels, which makes their computational complexity a bottleneck when scaling up to large-scale output space. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel MLC learning method named Scalable Label Distribution Learning (SLDL) for multi-label classification which can describe different labels as distributions in a latent space, where the label correlation is asymmetric and the dimension is independent of the number of labels. Specifically, SLDL first converts labels into continuous distributions within a low-dimensional latent space and leverages the asymmetric metric to establish the correlation between different labels. Then, it learns the mapping from the feature space to the latent space, resulting in the computational complexity is no longer related to the number of labels. Finally, SLDL leverages a nearest-neighbor-based strategy to decode the latent representations and obtain the final predictions. Our extensive experiments illustrate that SLDL can achieve very competitive classification performances with little computational consumption",

However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straight trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy guided by diffusion model from entire distribution level. First, we propose a coupling strategy to straighten trajectories, creating couplings between image and noise samples under diffusion model guidance. Second, StraightFM also integrates real data to enhance training, employing a neural network to parameterize another coupling process from images to noise samples. StraightFM is jointly optimized with couplings from above two mutually complementary directions, resulting in straighter trajectories and enabling both one-step and few-step generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StraightFM yields high quality samples with fewer step. StraightFM generates visually appealing images with a lower FID among diffusion and traditional flow matching methods within 5 sampling steps when trained on pixel space. In the latent space (i.e., Latent Diffusion), StraightFM achieves a lower KID value compared to existing methods on the CelebA-HQ 256 dataset in fewer than 10 sampling steps",

In this paper, we delve into the impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training, specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence speed of SGD. Counterintuitively, we find that randomly permuting the pixel locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon, we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves, loss landscapes, and error patterns.

Despite the challenges associated with privacy-sensitive data, such domains could still benefit from valuable vision services provided by diffusion models. Federated learning (FL) plays a crucial role in enabling decentralized model training without compromising data privacy. Instead of collecting data, an FL system gathers model parameters, effectively safeguarding the private data of different parties involved. This makes FL systems vital for managing decentralized learning tasks, especially in scenarios where privacy-sensitive data is distributed across a network of clients. Nonetheless, FL presents its own set of challenges due to its distributed nature and privacy-preserving properties.

However, this requires estimating patient-specific parameters of the model from clinical data, which is a challenging inverse problem due to limited temporal data and the limited time between imaging and diagnosis. This work proposes a method that uses Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to estimate patient-specific parameters of a reaction-diffusion PDE model of GBM growth from a single 3D structural MRI snapshot. PINNs embed both the data and the PDE into a loss function, thus integrating theory and data. Key innovations include the identification and estimation of characteristic non-dimensional parameters, a pre-training step that utilizes the non-dimensional parameters and a fine-tuning step to determine the patient specific parameters. Additionally, the diffuse domain method is employed to handle the complex brain geometry within the PINN framework.

However, FL often suffers from data heterogeneity problems, which can significantly affect its performance. To address this, clustered federated learning (CFL) has been proposed to construct personalized models for different client clusters. One effective client clustering strategy is to allow clients to choose their own local models from a model pool based on their performance. However, without pre-trained model parameters, such a strategy is prone to clustering failure, in which all clients choose the same model. Unfortunately, collecting a large amount of labeled data for pre-training can be costly and impractical in distributed environments. To overcome this challenge, we leverage self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit unlabeled data for the pre-training of FL systems. Together, self-supervised pre-training and client clustering can be crucial components for tackling the data heterogeneity issues of FL. Leveraging these two crucial strategies, we propose contrastive pre-training-based clustered federated learning (CP-CFL) to improve the model convergence and overall performance of FL systems.

    "title": "Utility Fairness in Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Demand Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel contextual bandit algorithm for personalized pricing under utility fairness constraints in scenarios with uncertain demand, achieving an optimal regret upper bound. Our approach, which incorporates dynamic pricing and demand learning, addresses the critical challenge of fairness in pricing strategies. We first delve into the static full-information setting to formulate an optimal pricing policy as a constrained optimization problem. Here, we propose an approximation algorithm for efficiently and approximately computing the ideal policy. We also use mathematical analysis and computational studies to characterize the structures of optimal contextual pricing policies subject to fairness constraints, deriving simplified policies which lays the foundations of more in-depth research and extensions. Further, we extend our study to dynamic pricing problems with demand learning, establishing a non-standard regret lower bound that highlights the complexity added by fairness constraints. Our research offers a comprehensive analysis of the cost of fairness and its impact on the balance between utility and revenue maximization. This work represents a step towards integrating ethical considerations into algorithmic efficiency in data-driven dynamic pricing",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial training may be regarded as standard training with a modified loss function. But its generalization error appears much larger than standard training under standard loss. This phenomenon, known as robust overfitting, has attracted significant research attention and remains largely as a mystery. In this paper, we first show empirically that robust overfitting correlates with the increasing generalization difficulty of the perturbation-induced distributions along the trajectory of adversarial training (specifically PGD-based adversarial training). We then provide a novel upper bound for generalization error with respect to the perturbation-induced distributions, in which a notion of the perturbation operator, referred to \"local dispersion\", plays an important role",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Panoramic radiography is a widely used imaging modality in dental practice and research. However, it only provides flattened 2D images, which limits the detailed assessment of dental structures. In this paper, we propose Occudent, a framework for 3D teeth reconstruction from panoramic radiographs using neural implicit functions, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first work to do so. For a given point in 3D space, the implicit function estimates whether the point is occupied by a tooth, and thus implicitly determines the boundaries of 3D tooth shapes. Firstly, Occudent applies multi-label segmentation to the input panoramic radiograph. Next, tooth shape embeddings as well as tooth class embeddings are generated from the segmentation outputs, which are fed to the reconstruction network. A novel module called Conditional eXcitation (CX) is proposed in order to effectively incorporate the combined shape and class embeddings into the implicit function. The performance of Occudent is evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative measures. Importantly, Occudent is trained and validated with actual panoramic radiographs as input, distinct from recent works which used synthesized images. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of Occudent over state-of-the-art methods",

In this study, we explore three potential solutions to this problem: (1) a hybrid learning method that uses both equilibrium demonstrations and the HJI PDE, (2) a value-hardening method where a sequence of HJIs are solved with increasing Lipschitz constant on the constraint violation penalty, and (3) the epigraphical technique that lifts the value to a higher dimensional auxiliary state space where the value becomes continuous.

Multiple-input deep neural operators (MIONet) extended DeepONet to allow multiple input functions in different Banach spaces. MIONet offers flexibility in training dataset grid spacing, without constraints on output location. However, it requires offline inputs and cannot handle varying sequence lengths in testing datasets, limiting its real-time application in dynamic complex systems. This work redesigns MIONet, integrating Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to learn neural operators from time-dependent data. This approach overcomes data discretization constraints and harnesses LSTM's capability with variable-length, real-time data. Factors affecting learning performance, like algorithm extrapolation ability are presented. The framework is enhanced with uncertainty quantification through a novel Bayesian method, sampling from MIONet parameter distributions. Consequently, we develop the B-LSTM-MIONet, incorporating LSTM's temporal strengths with Bayesian robustness, resulting in a more precise and reliable model for noisy datasets",

As a first step towards an end-to-end method for generating speaking-style prompts from speech, i.e., automatic speaking-style captioning, StyleCap uses paired data of speech and natural language descriptions to train neural networks that predict prefix vectors fed into a large language model (LLM)-based text decoder from a speech representation vector. We explore an appropriate text decoder and speech feature representation suitable for this new task. The experimental results demonstrate that our StyleCap leveraging richer LLMs for the text decoder, speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and sentence rephrasing augmentation improves the accuracy and diversity of generated speaking-style captions.

DFL trains an ML model in an end-to-end system, by integrating the prediction and optimization tasks, providing better alignment of the training and testing objectives. DFL has shown a lot of promise and holds the capacity to revolutionize decision-making in many real-world applications. However, very little is known about the performance of these models under adversarial attacks. We adopt ten unique DFL methods and benchmark their performance under two distinctly focused attacks adapted towards the Predict-then-Optimize problem setting. Our study proposes the hypothesis that the robustness of a model is highly correlated with its ability to find predictions that lead to optimal decisions without deviating from the ground-truth label. Furthermore, we provide insight into how to target the models that violate this condition and show how these models respond differently depending on the achieved optimality at the end of their training cycles",

We also show that current federated optimization algorithms fail to disincentivize these harmful defections.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in various domains while the inference cost is expensive. The state-of-the-art methods use 2-bit quantization for mainstream LLMs. However, challenges still exist: (1) Nonnegligible accuracy loss for 2-bit quantization. Weights are quantized by groups, while the ranges of weights are large in some groups, resulting in large quantization errors and nonnegligible accuracy loss (e.g. >3% for Llama2-7b with 2-bit quantization in GPTQ and Greenbit). (2) Limited accuracy improvement by adding 4-bit weights. Increasing 10% extra average bit more 4-bit weights only leads to <0.5% accuracy improvement on a quantized Llama2-7b. (3) Time-consuming dequantization operations on GPUs. The dequantization operations lead to >50% execution time, hindering the potential of reducing LLM inference cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose the following techniques: (1) We only quantize a small fraction of groups with the larger range using 4-bit with memory alignment consideration on GPUs. (2) We point out that the distribution of the sparse outliers with larger weights is different in 2-bit and 4-bit groups, and only a small fraction of outliers require 16-bit quantization. Such design leads to >0.5% accuracy improvement with <3% average increased bit for Llama2-7b. (3) We design the asynchronous dequantization on GPUs, leading to up to 3.92X speedup. We conduct extensive experiments on different model families and model sizes. We achieve 2.85-bit for each weight and the end-to-end speedup for Llama2-7b is 1.74X over the original model, and we reduce both runtime cost and hardware cost by up to 2.70X and 2.81X with less GPU requirements",

This setting models the scenario of learning from high-dimensional yet structured data that are transmitted through a highly-noisy channel, so that the data points are unlikely to be entirely clean.

However, to date, no single eye-movement biomarker has been found to conclusively differentiate patients from healthy controls. In the present work, we investigate the use of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to perform Parkinson's disease classification using eye-tracking data from saccade experiments. In contrast to previous work, instead of using hand-crafted features from the saccades, we use raw $\\sim1.5\\,s$ long fixation intervals recorded during the preparatory phase before each trial. Using these short time series as input we implement two different classification models, InceptionTime and ROCKET.

We also employ a novel method for pruning the ROCKET model to improve interpretability and generalizability, achieving an accuracy of $96\\%$.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Combining machine learning with physics is a trending approach for discovering unknown dynamics, and one of the most intensively studied frameworks is the physics-informed neural network (PINN). However, PINN often fails to optimize the network due to its difficulty in concurrently minimizing multiple losses originating from the system's governing equations. This problem can be more serious when the system's states are unmeasurable, like lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). In this work, we introduce a robust method for training PINN that uses fewer loss terms and thus constructs a less complex landscape for optimization. In particular, instead of having loss terms from each differential equation, this method embeds the dynamics into a loss function that quantifies the error between observed and predicted system outputs. This is accomplished by numerically integrating the predicted states from the neural network(NN) using known dynamics and transforming them to obtain a sequence of predicted outputs. Minimizing such a loss optimizes the NN to predict states consistent with observations given the physics. Further, the system's parameters can be added to the optimization targets. To demonstrate the ability of this method to perform various modeling and control tasks, we apply it to a battery model to concurrently estimate its states and parameters",

The data representations are able to capture many underlying attributes of data, and be useful in downstream prediction tasks. In real-world settings, spurious correlations between some attributes (e.g. race, gender and age) and labels for downstream tasks often exist, e.g. cancer is usually more prevalent among elderly patients. In this paper, we investigate SSL in the presence of spurious correlations and show that the SSL training loss can be minimized by capturing only a subset of the conspicuous features relevant to those sensitive attributes, despite the presence of other important predictive features for the downstream tasks. To address this issue, we investigate the learning dynamics of SSL and observe that the learning is slower for samples that conflict with such correlations (e.g. elder patients without cancer). Motivated by these findings, we propose a learning-speed aware SSL (LA-SSL) approach, in which we sample each training data with a probability that is inversely related to its learning speed. We evaluate LA-SSL on three datasets that exhibit spurious correlations between different attributes, demonstrating that it improves the robustness of pretrained representations on downstream classification tasks",

    "title": "Cross Entropy in Deep Learning of Classifiers Is Unnecessary -- ISBE Error is All You Need",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In deep learning classifiers, the cost function usually takes the form of a combination of SoftMax and CrossEntropy functions. The SoftMax unit transforms the scores predicted by the model network into assessments of the degree (probabilities) of an object's membership to a given class. On the other hand, CrossEntropy measures the divergence of this prediction from the distribution of target scores. This work introduces the ISBE functionality, justifying the thesis about the redundancy of cross entropy computation in deep learning of classifiers. Not only can we omit the calculation of entropy, but also, during back-propagation, there is no need to direct the error to the normalization unit for its backward transformation. Instead, the error is sent directly to the model's network. Using examples of perceptron and convolutional networks as classifiers of images from the MNIST collection, it is observed for ISBE that results are not degraded with SoftMax only, but also with other activation functions such as Sigmoid, Tanh, or their hard variants HardSigmoid and HardTanh. Moreover, up to three percent of time is saved within the total time of forward and backward stages. The article is addressed mainly to programmers and students interested in deep model learning. For example, it illustrates in code snippets possible ways to implement ISBE units, but also formally proves that the softmax trick only applies to the class of softmax functions with relocations",

We propose a novel method, SR-DDPM, that leverages representation-based techniques from few-shot learning to effectively learn from fewer samples across different tasks. Our method consists of a core meta architecture with shared parameters, i.e., task-specific layers with exclusive parameters. By exploiting the similarity between diverse data distributions, our method can scale to multiple tasks without compromising the image quality.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While there has been significant progress in object detection using conventional image processing and machine learning algorithms, exploring small and dim target detection in the IR domain is a relatively new area of study. The majority of small and dim target detection methods are derived from conventional object detection algorithms, albeit with some alterations. The task of detecting small and dim targets in IR imagery is complex. This is because these targets often need distinct features, the background is cluttered with unclear details, and the IR signatures of the scene can change over time due to fluctuations in thermodynamics. The primary objective of this review is to highlight the progress made in this field. This is the first review in the field of small and dim target detection in infrared imagery, encompassing various methodologies ranging from conventional image processing to cutting-edge deep learning-based approaches. The authors have also introduced a taxonomy of such approaches. There are two main types of approaches: methodologies using several frames for detection, and single-frame-based detection techniques. Single frame-based detection techniques encompass a diverse range of methods, spanning from traditional image processing-based approaches to more advanced deep learning methodologies. Our findings indicate that deep learning approaches perform better than traditional image processing-based approaches. In addition, a comprehensive compilation of various available datasets has also been provided. Furthermore, this review identifies the gaps and limitations in existing techniques, paving the way for future research and development in this area",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs",

We have validated our reward shaping functions within a simulated environment for playing a marine capture-the-flag game between two players. Our experimental results demonstrate that reward shaping can be used as an effective means to understand the importance of different sub-tasks during game-play towards winning the game, to encode a secondary objective functions such as energy efficiency into a player's game-playing behavior, and, to improve learning generalizable policies that can perform well against different skill levels of the opponent",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We reinvigorate maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for macroeconomic density forecasting through a novel neural network architecture with dedicated mean and variance hemispheres. Our architecture features several key ingredients making MLE work in this context. First, the hemispheres share a common core at the entrance of the network which accommodates for various forms of time variation in the error variance. Second, we introduce a volatility emphasis constraint that breaks mean/variance indeterminacy in this class of overparametrized nonlinear models. Third, we conduct a blocked out-of-bag reality check to curb overfitting in both conditional moments. Fourth, the algorithm utilizes standard deep learning software and thus handles large data sets - both computationally and statistically. Ergo, our Hemisphere Neural Network (HNN) provides proactive volatility forecasts based on leading indicators when it can, and reactive volatility based on the magnitude of previous prediction errors when it must. We evaluate point and density forecasts with an extensive out-of-sample experiment and benchmark against a suite of models ranging from classics to more modern machine learning-based offerings. In all cases, HNN fares well by consistently providing accurate mean/variance forecasts for all targets and horizons. Studying the resulting volatility paths reveals its versatility, while probabilistic forecasting evaluation metrics showcase its enviable reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate how this machinery can be merged with other structured deep learning models by revisiting Goulet Coulombe (2022)'s Neural Phillips Curve",

    "abstract": "Modern ML systems ingest data aggregated from diverse sources, such as synthetic, human-annotated, and live customer traffic. Understanding \\textit{which} examples are important to the performance of a learning algorithm is crucial for efficient model training. Recently, a growing body of literature has given rise to various \"influence scores,\" which use training artifacts such as model confidence or checkpointed gradients to identify important subsets of data. However, these methods have primarily been developed in computer vision settings, and it remains unclear how well they generalize to language-based tasks using pretrained models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of influence scores in language classification tasks. We evaluate a diverse subset of these scores on the SNLI dataset by quantifying accuracy changes in response to pruning training data through random and influence-score-based sampling. We then stress-test one of the scores -- \"variance of gradients\" (VoG) from Agarwal et al. (2022) -- in an NLU model stack that was exposed to dynamic user speech patterns in a voice assistant type of setting. Our experiments demonstrate that in many cases, encoder-based language models can be finetuned on roughly 50% of the original data without degradation in performance metrics. Along the way, we summarize lessons learned from applying out-of-the-box implementations of influence scores, quantify the effects of noisy and class-imbalanced data, and offer recommendations on score-based sampling for better accuracy and training efficiency",

The key advantage of this approach is that a single-qubit measurement can accurately forecast various physical parameters, including fully-connected operators. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we use it to predict quench dynamics, chiral dynamics and jet production in a 1+1-dimensional model of quantum electrodynamics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can provide mechanistic models of temporally local changes of processes, where parameters are often informed by external knowledge. While ODEs are popular in systems modeling, they are less established for statistical modeling of longitudinal cohort data, e.g., in a clinical setting. Yet, modeling of local changes could also be attractive for assessing the trajectory of an individual in a cohort in the immediate future given its current status, where ODE parameters could be informed by further characteristics of the individual. However, several hurdles so far limit such use of ODEs, as compared to regression-based function fitting approaches. The potentially higher level of noise in cohort data might be detrimental to ODEs, as the shape of the ODE solution heavily depends on the initial value. In addition, larger numbers of variables multiply such problems and might be difficult to handle for ODEs. To address this, we propose to use each observation in the course of time as the initial value to obtain multiple local ODE solutions and build a combined estimator of the underlying dynamics. Neural networks are used for obtaining a low-dimensional latent space for dynamic modeling from a potentially large number of variables, and for obtaining patient-specific ODE parameters from baseline variables. Simultaneous identification of dynamic models and of a latent space is enabled by recently developed differentiable programming techniques. We illustrate the proposed approach in an application with spinal muscular atrophy patients and a corresponding simulation study. In particular, modeling of local changes in health status at any point in time is contrasted to the interpretation of functions obtained from a global regression.

QUBO to Ising Hamiltonian is regarded as a technique to solve various canonical optimization problems through quantum optimization algorithms. Recently, PI-GNN, a generic framework, has been proposed to address CO problems over graphs based on Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture. They introduced a generic QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian-inspired loss function that was directly optimized using GNN. PI-GNN is highly scalable but there lies a noticeable decrease in the number of satisfied constraints when compared to problem-specific algorithms and becomes more pronounced with increased graph densities. Here, We identify a behavioral pattern related to it and devise strategies to improve its performance. Another group of literature uses Reinforcement learning (RL) to solve the aforementioned NP-hard problems using problem-specific reward functions. In this work, we also focus on creating a bridge between the RL-based solutions and the QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian. We formulate and empirically evaluate the compatibility of the QUBO-formulated Hamiltonian as the generic reward function in the RL-based paradigm in the form of rewards. Furthermore, we also introduce a novel Monty Carlo Tree Search-based strategy with GNN where we apply a guided search through manual perturbation of node labels during training.

    "abstract": "Generative training has been demonstrated to be powerful for building visual-language models. However, on zero-shot discriminative benchmarks, there is still a performance gap between models trained with generative and discriminative objectives. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by improving the efficacy of generative training on classification tasks, without any finetuning processes or additional modules. Specifically, we focus on narrowing the gap between the generative captioner and the CLIP classifier. We begin by analysing the predictions made by the captioner and classifier and observe that the caption generation inherits the distribution bias from the language model trained with pure text modality, making it less grounded on the visual signal. To tackle this problem, we redesign the scoring objective for the captioner to alleviate the distributional bias and focus on measuring the gain of information brought by the visual inputs. We further design a generative training objective to match the evaluation objective. We name our model trained and evaluated from the novel procedures as Information Gain (IG) captioner. We pretrain the models on the public Laion-5B dataset and perform a series of discriminative evaluations. For the zero-shot classification on ImageNet, IG captioner achieves $> 18\\%$ improvements over the standard captioner, achieving comparable performances with the CLIP classifier. IG captioner also demonstrated strong performance on zero-shot image-text retrieval tasks on MSCOCO and Flickr30K.

In this work, we find that generative models can be great test-time adapters for discriminative models. Our method, Diffusion-TTA, adapts pre-trained discriminative models such as image classifiers, segmenters and depth predictors, to each unlabelled example in the test set using generative feedback from a diffusion model. We achieve this by modulating the conditioning of the diffusion model using the output of the discriminative model. We then maximize the image likelihood objective by backpropagating the gradients to discriminative model's parameters. We show Diffusion-TTA significantly enhances the accuracy of various large-scale pre-trained discriminative models, such as, ImageNet classifiers, CLIP models, image pixel labellers and image depth predictors. Diffusion-TTA outperforms existing test-time adaptation methods, including TTT-MAE and TENT, and particularly shines in online adaptation setups, where the discriminative model is continually adapted to each example in the test set.

In exploring adversarial robustness, we propose a straightforward attack strategy for misleading VLLMs to produce visual-unrelated responses. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of two jailbreaking strategies, targeting either the vision or language component of VLLMs. Our evaluation of 21 diverse models, ranging from open-source VLLMs to GPT-4V, yields interesting observations: 1) Current VLLMs struggle with OOD texts but not images, unless the visual information is limited; and 2) These VLLMs can be easily misled by deceiving vision encoders only, and their vision-language training often compromise safety protocols.

    "abstract": "Throughout history, we have successfully integrated various machines into our homes. Dishwashers, laundry machines, stand mixers, and robot vacuums are a few recent examples. However, these machines excel at performing only a single task effectively. The concept of a \"generalist machine\" in homes - a domestic assistant that can adapt and learn from our needs, all while remaining cost-effective - has long been a goal in robotics that has been steadily pursued for decades. In this work, we initiate a large-scale effort towards this goal by introducing Dobb-E, an affordable yet versatile general-purpose system for learning robotic manipulation within household settings. Dobb-E can learn a new task with only five minutes of a user showing it how to do it, thanks to a demonstration collection tool (\"The Stick\") we built out of cheap parts and iPhones. We use the Stick to collect 13 hours of data in 22 homes of New York City, and train Home Pretrained Representations (HPR). Then, in a novel home environment, with five minutes of demonstrations and fifteen minutes of adapting the HPR model, we show that Dobb-E can reliably solve the task on the Stretch, a mobile robot readily available on the market. Across roughly 30 days of experimentation in homes of New York City and surrounding areas, we test our system in 10 homes, with a total of 109 tasks in different environments, and finally achieve a success rate of 81%.

    "title": "Have we built machines that think like people?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A chief goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that think like people. Yet it has been argued that deep neural network architectures fail to accomplish this. Researchers have asserted these models' limitations in the domains of causal reasoning, intuitive physics, and intuitive psychology. Yet recent advancements, namely the rise of large language models, particularly those designed for visual processing, have rekindled interest in the potential to emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This paper evaluates the current state of vision-based large language models in the domains of intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology. Through a series of controlled experiments, we investigate the extent to which these modern models grasp complex physical interactions, causal relationships, and intuitive understanding of others' preferences. Our findings reveal that, while these models demonstrate a notable proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data, they still fall short of human capabilities in these areas. The models exhibit a rudimentary understanding of physical laws and causal relationships, but their performance is hindered by a lack of deeper insights-a key aspect of human cognition. Furthermore, in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind, the models fail altogether. Our results emphasize the need for integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into modern-day, vision-based language models, and point out the importance of cognitively-inspired benchmarks",

    "title": "Interactive Autonomous Navigation with Internal State Inference and Interactivity Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a promising way for intelligent agents (e.g., autonomous vehicles) to learn to navigate complex scenarios. However, DRL with neural networks as function approximators is typically considered a black box with little explainability and often suffers from suboptimal performance, especially for autonomous navigation in highly interactive multi-agent environments. To address these issues, we propose three auxiliary tasks with spatio-temporal relational reasoning and integrate them into the standard DRL framework, which improves the decision making performance and provides explainable intermediate indicators. We propose to explicitly infer the internal states (i.e., traits and intentions) of surrounding agents (e.g., human drivers) as well as to predict their future trajectories in the situations with and without the ego agent through counterfactual reasoning. These auxiliary tasks provide additional supervision signals to infer the behavior patterns of other interactive agents. Multiple variants of framework integration strategies are compared. We also employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network to encode relations between dynamic entities, which enhances both internal state inference and decision making of the ego agent. Moreover, we propose an interactivity estimation mechanism based on the difference between predicted trajectories in these two situations, which indicates the degree of influence of the ego agent on other agents. To validate the proposed method, we design an intersection driving simulator based on the Intelligent Intersection Driver Model (IIDM) that simulates vehicles and pedestrians. Our approach achieves robust and state-of-the-art performance in terms of standard evaluation metrics and provides explainable intermediate indicators (i.e., internal states, and interactivity scores) for decision making",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical systems, yet the high error rates in contemporary quantum devices often exceed tolerable limits for useful algorithm execution. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) mitigates this by employing redundancy, distributing quantum information across multiple data qubits and utilizing syndrome qubits to monitor their states for errors. The syndromes are subsequently interpreted by a decoding algorithm to identify and correct errors in the data qubits. This task is complex due to the multiplicity of error sources affecting both data and syndrome qubits as well as syndrome extraction operations. Additionally, identical syndromes can emanate from different error sources, necessitating a decoding algorithm that evaluates syndromes collectively. Although machine learning (ML) decoders such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed, they often focus on local syndrome regions and require retraining when adjusting for different code distances. We introduce a transformer-based QEC decoder which employs self-attention to achieve a global receptive field across all input syndromes. It incorporates a mixed loss training approach, combining both local physical error and global parity label losses. Moreover, the transformer architecture's inherent adaptability to variable-length inputs allows for efficient transfer learning, enabling the decoder to adapt to varying code distances without retraining. Evaluation on six code distances and ten different error configurations demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms non-ML decoders, such as Union Find (UF) and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and other ML decoders, thereby achieving best logical error rates. Moreover, the transfer learning can save over 10x of training cost",

While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITRON-70B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within 5% of GPT-4 and 10% of Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and the MEDITRON model weights to drive open-source development of more capable medical LLMs",

    "abstract": "This review paper takes a comprehensive look at malicious attacks against FL, categorizing them from new perspectives on attack origins and targets, and providing insights into their methodology and impact. In this survey, we focus on threat models targeting the learning process of FL systems. Based on the source and target of the attack, we categorize existing threat models into four types, Data to Model (D2M), Model to Data (M2D), Model to Model (M2M) and composite attacks. For each attack type, we discuss the defense strategies proposed, highlighting their effectiveness, assumptions and potential areas for improvement. Defense strategies have evolved from using a singular metric to excluding malicious clients, to employing a multifaceted approach examining client models at various phases. In this survey paper, our research indicates that the to-learn data, the learning gradients, and the learned model at different stages all can be manipulated to initiate malicious attacks that range from undermining model performance, reconstructing private local data, and to inserting backdoors. We have also seen these threat are becoming more insidious. While earlier studies typically amplified malicious gradients, recent endeavors subtly alter the least significant weights in local models to bypass defense measures. This literature review provides a holistic understanding of the current FL threat landscape and highlights the importance of developing robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving defenses to ensure the safe and trusted adoption of FL in real-world applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q depolarizing channel. We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations. Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch",

    "abstract": "The clinical management of breast cancer depends on an accurate understanding of the tumor and its anatomical context to adjacent tissues and landmark structures. This context may be provided by semantic segmentation methods; however, previous works have been largely limited to a singular focus on the tumor alone and rarely other tissue types. In contrast, we present a method that exploits tissue-tissue interactions to accurately segment every major tissue type in the breast including: chest wall, skin, adipose tissue, fibroglandular tissue, vasculature and tumor via standard-of-care Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI. Comparing our method to prior state-of-the-art, we achieved a superior Dice score on tumor segmentation while maintaining competitive performance on other studied tissues across multiple institutions. Briefly, our method proceeds by localizing the tumor using 2D object detectors, then segmenting the tumor and surrounding tissues independently using two 3D U-nets, and finally integrating these results while mitigating false positives by checking for anatomically plausible tissue-tissue contacts. The object detection models were pre-trained on ImageNet and COCO, and operated on MIP (maximum intensity projection) images in the axial and sagittal planes, establishing a 3D tumor bounding box. By integrating multiple relevant peri-tumoral tissues, our work enables clinical applications in breast cancer staging, prognosis and surgical planning",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Understanding how the 3D scene evolves is vital for making decisions in autonomous driving. Most existing methods achieve this by predicting the movements of object boxes, which cannot capture more fine-grained scene information. In this paper, we explore a new framework of learning a world model, OccWorld, in the 3D Occupancy space to simultaneously predict the movement of the ego car and the evolution of the surrounding scenes. We propose to learn a world model based on 3D occupancy rather than 3D bounding boxes and segmentation maps for three reasons: 1) expressiveness. 3D occupancy can describe the more fine-grained 3D structure of the scene; 2) efficiency. 3D occupancy is more economical to obtain (e.g., from sparse LiDAR points). 3) versatility. 3D occupancy can adapt to both vision and LiDAR. To facilitate the modeling of the world evolution, we learn a reconstruction-based scene tokenizer on the 3D occupancy to obtain discrete scene tokens to describe the surrounding scenes. We then adopt a GPT-like spatial-temporal generative transformer to generate subsequent scene and ego tokens to decode the future occupancy and ego trajectory. Extensive experiments on the widely used nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the ability of OccWorld to effectively model the evolution of the driving scenes. OccWorld also produces competitive planning results without using instance and map supervision. Code: https://github.com/wzzheng/OccWorld",

    "abstract": "Quantum state preparation, a crucial subroutine in quantum computing, involves generating a target quantum state from initialized qubits. Arbitrary state preparation algorithms can be broadly categorized into arithmetic decomposition (AD) and variational quantum state preparation (VQSP). AD employs a predefined procedure to decompose the target state into a series of gates, whereas VQSP iteratively tunes ansatz parameters to approximate target state. VQSP is particularly apt for Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines due to its shorter circuits. However, achieving noise-robust parameter optimization still remains challenging. We present RobustState, a novel VQSP training methodology that combines high robustness with high training efficiency. The core idea involves utilizing measurement outcomes from real machines to perform back-propagation through classical simulators, thus incorporating real quantum noise into gradient calculations. RobustState serves as a versatile, plug-and-play technique applicable for training parameters from scratch or fine-tuning existing parameters to enhance fidelity on target machines. It is adaptable to various ansatzes at both gate and pulse levels and can even benefit other variational algorithms, such as variational unitary synthesis. Comprehensive evaluation of RobustState on state preparation tasks for 4 distinct quantum algorithms using 10 real quantum machines demonstrates a coherent error reduction of up to 7.1 $\\times$ and state fidelity improvement of up to 96\\% and 81\\% for 4-Q and 5-Q states, respectively.

    "title": "Forecasting Auxiliary Energy Consumption for Electric Heavy-Duty Vehicles",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Accurate energy consumption prediction is crucial for optimizing the operation of electric commercial heavy-duty vehicles, e.g., route planning for charging. Moreover, understanding why certain predictions are cast is paramount for such a predictive model to gain user trust and be deployed in practice. Since commercial vehicles operate differently as transportation tasks, ambient, and drivers vary, a heterogeneous population is expected when building an AI system for forecasting energy consumption. The dependencies between the input features and the target values are expected to also differ across sub-populations. One well-known example of such a statistical phenomenon is the Simpson paradox. In this paper, we illustrate that such a setting poses a challenge for existing XAI methods that produce global feature statistics, e.g. LIME or SHAP, causing them to yield misleading results. We demonstrate a potential solution by training multiple regression models on subsets of data. It not only leads to superior regression performance but also more relevant and consistent LIME explanations. Given that the employed groupings correspond to relevant sub-populations, the associations between the input features and the target values are consistent within each cluster but different across clusters. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that such splitting of a complex problem into simpler ones yields better regression performance and interpretability",

    "title": "Automated Measurement of Vascular Calcification in Femoral Endarterectomy Patients Using Deep Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the large arteries, presents a global health risk. Accurate analysis of diagnostic images, like computed tomographic angiograms (CTAs), is essential for staging and monitoring the progression of atherosclerosis-related conditions, including peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, manual analysis of CTA images is time-consuming and tedious. To address this limitation, we employed a deep learning model to segment the vascular system in CTA images of PAD patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery and to measure vascular calcification from the left renal artery to the patella. Utilizing proprietary CTA images of 27 patients undergoing femoral endarterectomy surgery provided by Prisma Health Midlands, we developed a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model to first segment the arterial system, starting from the descending aorta to the patella, and second, to provide a metric of arterial calcification. Our designed DNN achieved 83.4% average Dice accuracy in segmenting arteries from aorta to patella, advancing the state-of-the-art by 0.8%. Furthermore, our work is the first to present a robust statistical analysis of automated calcification measurement in the lower extremities using deep learning, attaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.5% and a correlation coefficient of 0.978 between automated and manual calcification scores. These findings underscore the potential of deep learning techniques as a rapid and accurate tool for medical professionals to assess calcification in the abdominal aorta and its branches above the patella.

    "title": "Closing the ODE-SDE gap in score-based diffusion models through the Fokker-Planck equation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have emerged as one of the most promising frameworks for deep generative modelling, due to their state-of-the art performance in many generation tasks while relying on mathematical foundations such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Empirically, it has been reported that ODE based samples are inferior to SDE based samples. In this paper we rigorously describe the range of dynamics and approximations that arise when training score-based diffusion models, including the true SDE dynamics, the neural approximations, the various approximate particle dynamics that result, as well as their associated Fokker--Planck equations and the neural network approximations of these Fokker--Planck equations. We systematically analyse the difference between the ODE and SDE dynamics of score-based diffusion models, and link it to an associated Fokker--Planck equation. We derive a theoretical upper bound on the Wasserstein 2-distance between the ODE- and SDE-induced distributions in terms of a Fokker--Planck residual. We also show numerically that conventional score-based diffusion models can exhibit significant differences between ODE- and SDE-induced distributions which we demonstrate using explicit comparisons. Moreover, we show numerically that reducing the Fokker--Planck residual by adding it as an additional regularisation term leads to closing the gap between ODE- and SDE-induced distributions. Our experiments suggest that this regularisation can improve the distribution generated by the ODE, however that this can come at the cost of degraded SDE sample quality",

However, model parameters are of interest only insomuch as they combine with the functional form of a model to provide a function that can make good predictions. Moreover, the most likely parameters under the parameter posterior do not generally correspond to the most likely function induced by the parameter posterior. In fact, we can re-parametrize a model such that any setting of parameters can maximize the parameter posterior. As an alternative, we investigate the benefits and drawbacks of directly estimating the most likely function implied by the model and the data. We show that this procedure leads to pathological solutions when using neural networks and prove conditions under which the procedure is well-behaved, as well as a scalable approximation. Under these conditions, we find that function-space MAP estimation can lead to flatter minima, better generalization, and improved robustness to overfitting",

In our work, we contribute an approach that uses all internal representations by employing multiple pooling strategies on all activation and hidden states. Our novel lightweight strategy, Sparsify-then-Classify (STC) first sparsifies task-specific features layer-by-layer, then aggregates across layers for text classification. STC can be applied as a seamless plug-and-play module on top of existing LLMs. Our experiments on a comprehensive set of models and datasets demonstrate that STC not only consistently improves the classification performance of pretrained and fine-tuned models, but is also more efficient for both training and inference, and is more intrinsically interpretable",

In this work we present an approach to employ Quantum Annealing (QA) in QTL-based image classification. Specifically, we propose using annealing-based Quantum Boltzmann Machines as part of a hybrid quantum-classical pipeline to learn the classification of real-world, large-scale data such as medical images through supervised training. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to the three-class COVID-CT-MD dataset, a collection of lung Computed Tomography (CT) scan slices. Using Simulated Annealing as a stand-in for actual QA, we compare our method to classical transfer learning, using a neural network of the same order of magnitude, to display its improved classification performance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our Sieve-\\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a fraction of the computational resources",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A key challenge of modern machine learning systems is to achieve Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization -- generalizing to target data whose distribution differs from that of source data. Despite its significant importance, the fundamental question of ``what are the most effective algorithms for OOD generalization'' remains open even under the standard setting of covariate shift. This paper addresses this fundamental question by proving that, surprisingly, classical Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) purely using source data (without any modification) achieves the minimax optimality for covariate shift under the well-specified setting. That is, no algorithm performs better than MLE in this setting (up to a constant factor), justifying MLE is all you need. Our result holds for a very rich class of parametric models, and does not require any boundedness condition on the density ratio. We illustrate the wide applicability of our framework by instantiating it to three concrete examples -- linear regression, logistic regression, and phase retrieval. This paper further complement the study by proving that, under the misspecified setting, MLE is no longer the optimal choice, whereas Maximum Weighted Likelihood Estimator (MWLE) emerges as minimax optimal in certain scenarios",

Programmatic RL methods (Trivedi et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2023) reformulate solving RL tasks as synthesizing interpretable programs that can be executed in the environments. Despite encouraging results, these methods are limited to short-horizon tasks. On the other hand, representing RL policies using state machines (Inala et al., 2020) can inductively generalize to long-horizon tasks; however, it struggles to scale up to acquire diverse and complex behaviors. This work proposes Program Machine Policies (POMPs), which bridge the advantages of programmatic RL and state machine policies, allowing for the representation of complex behaviors and the address of long-term tasks. Specifically, we introduce a method that can retrieve a set of effective, diverse, compatible programs. Then, we use these programs as modes of a state machine and learn a transition function to transition among mode programs, allowing for capturing long-horizon repetitive behaviors. Our proposed framework outperforms programmatic RL and deep RL baselines on various tasks and demonstrates the ability to generalize to even longer horizons without any fine-tuning inductively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Drug combination refers to the use of two or more drugs to treat a specific disease at the same time. It is currently the mainstream way to treat complex diseases. Compared with single drugs, drug combinations have better efficacy and can better inhibit toxicity and drug resistance. The computational model based on deep learning concatenates the representation of multiple drugs and the corresponding cell line feature as input, and the output is whether the drug combination can have an inhibitory effect on the cell line. However, this strategy of concatenating multiple representations has the following defects: the alignment of drug representation and cell line representation is ignored, resulting in the synergistic relationship not being reflected positionally in the embedding space. Moreover, the alignment measurement function in deep learning cannot be suitable for drug synergy prediction tasks due to differences in input types. Therefore, in this work, we propose a graph convolutional network with multi-representation alignment (GCNMRA) for predicting drug synergy. In the GCNMRA model, we designed a multi-representation alignment function suitable for the drug synergy prediction task so that the positional relationship between drug representations and cell line representation is reflected in the embedding space. In addition, the vector modulus of drug representations and cell line representation is considered to improve the accuracy of calculation results and accelerate model convergence. Finally, many relevant experiments were run on multiple drug synergy datasets to verify the effectiveness of the above innovative elements and the excellence of the GCNMRA model",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The single domain generalization(SDG) based on meta-learning has emerged as an effective technique for solving the domain-shift problem. However, the inadequate match of data distribution between source and augmented domains and difficult separation of domain-invariant features from domain-related features make SDG model hard to achieve great generalization. Therefore, a novel meta-learning method based on domain enhancement and feature alignment (MetaDefa) is proposed to improve the model generalization performance. First, the background substitution and visual corruptions techniques are used to generate diverse and effective augmented domains. Then, the multi-channel feature alignment module based on class activation maps and class agnostic activation maps is designed to effectively extract adequate transferability knowledge. In this module, domain-invariant features can be fully explored by focusing on similar target regions between source and augmented domains feature space and suppressing the feature representation of non-similar target regions. Extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets show that MetaDefa has significant generalization performance advantages in unknown multiple target domains",

    "title": "Continual Instruction Tuning for Large Multimodal Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning is now a widely adopted approach to aligning large multimodal models (LMMs) to follow human intent. It unifies the data format of vision-language tasks, enabling multi-task joint training. However, vision-language tasks are constantly being created in practice. Instead of always re-training LMMs when new tasks arrive, continual learning offers flexibility for models to continually and efficiently exploit the evolving data. This work aims to explore the following two questions: 1) Do LMMs still suffer from catastrophic forgetting in continual instruction tuning? 2) Are the existing three classes of continual learning methods still applicable to the continual instruction tuning of LMMs? An extensive study is conducted to address the above questions. First, we establish the first benchmark in this setting and reveal that catastrophic forgetting is still observed when continually instruction-tuning LMMs. However, the multi-task joint instruction tuning can facilitate the model's continual learning ability and mitigate forgetting. Second, we integrate and adapt classic continual learning methods to our context, demonstrating the efficacy of data replay and model expansion strategies across diverse scenarios. In contrast, regularization-based methods only perform well on models that have been jointly instruction-tuned on multiple tasks. Third, we delve into the correlation and forgetting dynamics between vision-language task pairs and propose task-similarity-informed regularization and model expansion methods for continual instruction tuning of LMMs. Experimental results show that our approach consistently boosts the model's performance",

    "abstract": "Computing the matter power spectrum, $P(k)$, as a function of cosmological parameters can be prohibitively slow in cosmological analyses, hence emulating this calculation is desirable. Previous analytic approximations are insufficiently accurate for modern applications, so black-box, uninterpretable emulators are often used. We utilise an efficient genetic programming based symbolic regression framework to explore the space of potential mathematical expressions which can approximate the power spectrum and $\\sigma_8$. We learn the ratio between an existing low-accuracy fitting function for $P(k)$ and that obtained by solving the Boltzmann equations and thus still incorporate the physics which motivated this earlier approximation. We obtain an analytic approximation to the linear power spectrum with a root mean squared fractional error of 0.2% between $k = 9\\times10^{-3} - 9 \\, h{\\rm \\, Mpc^{-1}}$ and across a wide range of cosmological parameters, and we provide physical interpretations for various terms in the expression. We also provide a simple analytic approximation for $\\sigma_8$ with a similar accuracy, with a root mean squared fractional error of just 0.4% when evaluated across the same range of cosmologies. This function is easily invertible to obtain $A_{\\rm s}$ as a function of $\\sigma_8$ and the other cosmological parameters, if preferred. It is possible to obtain symbolic approximations to a seemingly complex function at a precision required for current and future cosmological analyses without resorting to deep-learning techniques, thus avoiding their black-box nature and large number of parameters.

Among several possible approaches, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has emerged as a promising method to address a wide range of complex optimization problems like power control. However, the seamless application of MADRL to a variety of network optimization problems faces several challenges related to convergence. In this paper, we present the use of graphs as communication-inducing structures among distributed agents as an effective means to mitigate these challenges. Specifically, we harness graph neural networks (GNNs) as neural architectures for policy parameterization to introduce a relational inductive bias in the collective decision-making process. Most importantly, we focus on modeling the dynamic interactions among sets of neighboring agents through the introduction of innovative methods for defining a graph-induced framework for integrated communication and learning.

This affords us i) to rank the hyperopt engines, ii) to make generalized and statistically significant statements on how much they improve over random search, and iii) to make recommendations on which engine should be used to hyperopt a given learning algorithm. We find that most engines beat random search, but that only three of them (HEBO, AX, and BlendSearch) clearly stand out.

Exploiting these cell maps provides the model with robust generalizability to new data, achieving approximately 30% higher accuracy on unseen test-sets compared to current state of the art approaches.

As of today, state-of-the-art activity recognition from wearable sensors relies on classifiers being trained on fixed windows of data.

This paper is the first to systematically demonstrate the applicability of state-of-the-art TAL models for wearable Human Activity Recongition (HAR) using raw inertial data as input. Our results show that state-of-the-art TAL models are able to outperform popular inertial models on 4 out of 6 wearable activity recognition benchmark datasets, with improvements ranging as much as 25% in F1-score. Introducing the TAL community's most popular metric to inertial-based HAR, namely mean Average Precision, our analysis shows that TAL models are able to produce more coherent segments along with an overall higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets. Being the first to provide such an analysis, the TAL community offers an interesting new perspective to inertial-based HAR with yet to be explored design choices and training concepts, which could be of significant value for the inertial-based HAR community",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation in Neural Networks (NNs) is vital in improving reliability and confidence in predictions, particularly in safety-critical applications. Bayesian Neural Networks (BayNNs) with Dropout as an approximation offer a systematic approach to quantifying uncertainty, but they inherently suffer from high hardware overhead in terms of power, memory, and computation. Thus, the applicability of BayNNs to edge devices with limited resources or to high-performance applications is challenging. Some of the inherent costs of BayNNs can be reduced by accelerating them in hardware on a Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture with spintronic memories and binarizing their parameters. However, numerous stochastic units are required to implement conventional dropout-based BayNN. In this paper, we propose the Scale Dropout, a novel regularization technique for Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), and Monte Carlo-Scale Dropout (MC-Scale Dropout)-based BayNNs for efficient uncertainty estimation. Our approach requires only one stochastic unit for the entire model, irrespective of the model size, leading to a highly scalable Bayesian NN. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Spintronic memory-based CIM architecture for the proposed BayNN that achieves more than $100\\times$ energy savings compared to the state-of-the-art.

This review revealed a diverse range of data inputs influencing energy prediction, with occupancy and meteorological data emerging as significant predictors. However, many studies failed to delve deep into the implications of their data choices, and gaps were evident regarding the understanding of time dynamics, operational status, and preprocessing methods. Machine learning, especially deep learning models like ANNs, have shown potential in this domain, yet they come with challenges, including interpretability and computational demands. The findings underscore the immense potential of AI in optimizing hospital energy consumption but also highlight the need for more comprehensive and granular research.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern machine learning systems use models trained on ever-growing corpora. Typically, metadata such as ownership, access control, or licensing information is ignored during training. Instead, to mitigate privacy risks, we rely on generic techniques such as dataset sanitization and differentially private model training, with inherent privacy/utility trade-offs that hurt model performance. Moreover, these techniques have limitations in scenarios where sensitive information is shared across multiple participants and fine-grained access control is required. By ignoring metadata, we therefore miss an opportunity to better address security, privacy, and confidentiality challenges. In this paper, we take an information flow control perspective to describe machine learning systems, which allows us to leverage metadata such as access control policies and define clear-cut privacy and confidentiality guarantees with interpretable information flows. Under this perspective, we contrast two different approaches to achieve user-level non-interference: 1) fine-tuning per-user models, and 2) retrieval augmented models that access user-specific datasets at inference time. We compare these two approaches to a trivially non-interfering zero-shot baseline using a public model and to a baseline that fine-tunes this model on the whole corpus. We evaluate trained models on two datasets of scientific articles and demonstrate that retrieval augmented architectures deliver the best utility, scalability, and flexibility while satisfying strict non-interference guarantees",

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Diffusion model, a prevalent framework for image generation, encounters significant challenges in terms of broad applicability due to its extended inference times and substantial memory requirements. Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models, diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step $t$ to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually, $t$ from the finite set $\\{1, \\ldots, T\\}$ is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods, resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these, we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step $t$ and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design, we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time. Equipped with the framework, we can maintain the most temporal information and ensure the end-to-end generation quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets and diffusion models prove our state-of-the-art results. Remarkably, our quantization approach, for the first time, achieves model performance nearly on par with the full-precision model under 4-bit weight quantization. Additionally, our method incurs almost no extra computational cost and accelerates quantization time by $2.0 \\times$ on LSUN-Bedrooms $256 \\times 256$ compared to previous works",

More specifically, we: i) bring to light the problem of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of entity names and descriptions in Wikidata; ii) demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods, namely, Machine Translation (MT), Web Search (WS), and Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with this task; iii) present M-NTA, a novel unsupervised approach that combines MT, WS, and LLMs to generate high-quality textual information; and, iv) study the impact of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of non-English textual information in Entity Linking, Knowledge Graph Completion, and Question Answering. As part of our effort towards better multilingual knowledge graphs, we also introduce WikiKGE-10, the first human-curated benchmark to evaluate KGE approaches in 10 languages across 7 language families",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the \\textit{graph condensation} problem by compressing the large, complex graph into a concise, synthetic representation that preserves the most essential and discriminative information of structure and features. We seminally propose the concept of Shock Absorber (a type of perturbation) that enhances the robustness and stability of the original graphs against changes in an adversarial training fashion. Concretely, (I) we forcibly match the gradients between pre-selected graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on a synthetic, simplified graph and the original training graph at regularly spaced intervals. (II) Before each update synthetic graph point, a Shock Absorber serves as a gradient attacker to maximize the distance between the synthetic dataset and the original graph by selectively perturbing the parts that are underrepresented or insufficiently informative. We iteratively repeat the above two processes (I and II) in an adversarial training fashion to maintain the highly-informative context without losing correlation with the original dataset. More importantly, our shock absorber and the synthesized graph parallelly share the backward process in a free training manner. Compared to the original adversarial training, it introduces almost no additional time overhead. We validate our framework across 8 datasets (3 graph and 5 node classification datasets) and achieve prominent results: for example, on Cora, Citeseer and Ogbn-Arxiv, we can gain nearly 1.13% to 5.03% improvements compare with SOTA models. Moreover, our algorithm adds only about 0.2% to 2.2% additional time overhead over Flicker, Citeseer and Ogbn-Arxiv. Compared to the general adversarial training, our approach improves time efficiency by nearly 4-fold",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the large research effort devoted to learning dependencies between time series, the state of the art still faces a major limitation: existing methods learn partial correlations but fail to discriminate across distinct frequency bands. Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain",

In this study, we intend to address the generation of high-resolution DEMs using high-resolution multi-spectral (MX) satellite imagery by incorporating adversarial learning. To promptly regulate this process, we utilize the notion of polarized self-attention of discriminator spatial maps as well as introduce a Densely connected Multi-Residual Block (DMRB) module to assist in efficient gradient flow. Further, we present an objective function related to optimizing Sinkhorn distance with traditional GAN to improve the stability of adversarial learning.

We demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative outcomes with available state-of-the-art methods. Based on our experiments on DEM datasets of Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Cartosat-1, we show that the proposed model performs preferably against other learning-based state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative influence, engendering paradigm shifts in global societies, spanning academia and industry. However, in light of these rapid advances, addressing the underrepresentation of black communities and African countries in AI is crucial. Boosting enthusiasm for AI can be effectively accomplished by showcasing straightforward applications around tasks like identifying and categorizing traditional symbols, such as Adinkra symbols, or familiar objects within the community. In this research endeavor, we dived into classical machine learning and harnessed the power of deep learning models to tackle the intricate task of classifying and recognizing Adinkra symbols. The idea led to a newly constructed ADINKRA dataset comprising 174,338 images meticulously organized into 62 distinct classes, each representing a singular and emblematic symbol. We constructed a CNN model for classification and recognition using six convolutional layers, three fully connected (FC) layers, and optional dropout regularization. The model is a simpler and smaller version of VGG, with fewer layers, smaller channel sizes, and a fixed kernel size. Additionally, we tap into the transfer learning capabilities provided by pre-trained models like VGG and ResNet. These models assist us in both classifying images and extracting features that can be used with classical machine learning models. We assess the model's performance by measuring its accuracy and convergence rate and visualizing the areas that significantly influence its predictions. These evaluations serve as a foundational benchmark for future assessments of the ADINKRA dataset. We hope this application exemplar inspires ideas on the various uses of AI in organizing our traditional and modern lives",

    "abstract": "As black-box machine learning models grow in complexity and find applications in high-stakes scenarios, it is imperative to provide explanations for their predictions. Although Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) [22] is a widely adpoted method for understanding model behaviors, it is unstable with respect to random seeds [35,24,3] and exhibits low local fidelity (i.e., how well the explanation approximates the model's local behaviors) [21,16]. Our study shows that this instability problem stems from small sample weights, leading to the dominance of regularization and slow convergence. Additionally, LIME's sampling neighborhood is non-local and biased towards the reference, resulting in poor local fidelity and sensitivity to reference choice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GLIME, an enhanced framework extending LIME and unifying several prior methods. Within the GLIME framework, we derive an equivalent formulation of LIME that achieves significantly faster convergence and improved stability. By employing a local and unbiased sampling distribution, GLIME generates explanations with higher local fidelity compared to LIME. GLIME explanations are independent of reference choice. Moreover, GLIME offers users the flexibility to choose a sampling distribution based on their specific scenarios",

Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of AI methods for accurate and early diagnosis of lung cancer from routine scans. However, this evidence has not translated into clinical practice with one barrier being a lack of interpretable models. This study investigates the application Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions. Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent space with disentangled feature representation.

Our analysis addresses the challenge of attempting to understand the sequence of structural changes, especially in multifaceted characterization data where 11 structural parameters derived from 8 characterization methods interact with complex behavior. The results show how phase lags (asynchronous changes from stimuli) and parameter similarities can illuminate the sequence of structural changes in materials, providing insights into phenomena like the removal of amorphous carbon and graphitization in annealed CNTs. This approach is beneficial even with limited data and holds promise for a wide range of material analyses, demonstrating its potential in elucidating complex material behaviors and properties",

In order to act ethically and comply with government regulations, these models need to make fair decisions and protect the users' privacy. However, such requirements can come with decrease in models' performance compared to their potentially biased, privacy-leaking counterparts. Thus the trade-off between fairness, privacy and performance of ML models emerges, and practitioners need a way of quantifying this trade-off to enable deployment decisions. In this work we interpret this trade-off as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose PFairDP, a pipeline that uses Bayesian optimization for discovery of Pareto-optimal points between fairness, privacy and utility of ML models. We show how PFairDP can be used to replicate known results that were achieved through manual constraint setting process.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Entity matching, a core data integration problem, is the task of deciding whether two data tuples refer to the same real-world entity. Recent advances in deep learning methods, using pre-trained language models, were proposed for resolving entity matching. Although demonstrating unprecedented results, these solutions suffer from a major drawback as they require large amounts of labeled data for training, and, as such, are inadequate to be applied to low resource entity matching problems. To overcome the challenge of obtaining sufficient labeled data we offer a new active learning approach, focusing on a selection mechanism that exploits unique properties of entity matching. We argue that a distributed representation of a tuple pair indicates its informativeness when considered among other pairs. This is used consequently in our approach that iteratively utilizes space-aware considerations. Bringing it all together, we treat the low resource entity matching problem as a Battleship game, hunting indicative samples, focusing on positive ones, through awareness of the latent space along with careful planning of next sampling iterations. An extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art active learning solutions to low resource entity matching, and although using less samples, can be as successful as state-of-the-art fully trained known algorithms",

Minimizing the coding cost implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities. We analytically show that this mutual information can be written as the sum of two terms that can be interpreted as (i) finding an appropriate representation space, and, (ii) building a representation with the appropriate metrics, based on the neural Fisher information on this space. One main consequence is that category learning induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. Finally, we provide numerical illustrations that show how Fisher information of the coding neural population aligns with the boundaries between categories",

The new robotic dataset of 67k daily instruction tasks is gathered for fine-tuning the Llama model and obtaining RoboGPT. RoboGPT planner with strong generalization can plan hundreds of daily instruction tasks. Additionally, a low-computational Re-Plan module is designed to allow plans to flexibly adapt to the environment, thereby addressing the nomenclature diversity challenge.

    "abstract": "We study a strategic variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, which we coin the strategic click-bandit. This model is motivated by applications in online recommendation where the choice of recommended items depends on both the click-through rates and the post-click rewards. Like in classical bandits, rewards follow a fixed unknown distribution. However, we assume that the click-rate of each arm is chosen strategically by the arm (e.g., a host on Airbnb) in order to maximize the number of times it gets clicked. The algorithm designer does not know the post-click rewards nor the arms' actions (i.e., strategically chosen click-rates) in advance, and must learn both values over time. To solve this problem, we design an incentive-aware learning algorithm, UCB-S, which achieves two goals simultaneously: (a) incentivizing desirable arm behavior under uncertainty; (b) minimizing regret by learning unknown parameters. We characterize all approximate Nash equilibria among arms under UCB-S and show a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}} (\\sqrt{KT})$ regret bound uniformly in every equilibrium. We also show that incentive-unaware algorithms generally fail to achieve low regret in the strategic click-bandit. Finally, we support our theoretical results by simulations of strategic arm behavior which confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed incentive design",

Traditional traffic prediction methods rely only on historical traffic data to predict traffic trends and face two main challenges. 1) insensitivity to unusual events. 2) poor performance in long-term prediction. In this work, we explore how generative models combined with text describing the traffic system can be applied for traffic generation and name the task Text-to-Traffic Generation (TTG). The key challenge of the TTG task is how to associate text with the spatial structure of the road network and traffic data for generating traffic situations. To this end, we propose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for text-to-traffic generation. To guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a diffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial correlations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large dataset containing text-traffic pairs for the TTG task. We benchmarked our model qualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset. The experimental results indicate that ChatTraffic can generate realistic traffic situations from the text. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ChyaZhang/ChatTraffic",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The spread of fake news using out-of-context images has become widespread and is a challenging task in this era of information overload. Since annotating huge amounts of such data requires significant time of domain experts, it is imperative to develop methods which can work in limited annotated data scenarios. In this work, we explore whether out-of-domain data can help to improve out-of-context misinformation detection (termed here as multi-modal fake news detection) of a desired domain, eg. politics, healthcare, etc. Towards this goal, we propose a novel framework termed DPOD (Domain-specific Prompt-tuning using Out-of-Domain data). First, to compute generalizable features, we modify the Vision-Language Model, CLIP to extract features that helps to align the representations of the images and corresponding text captions of both the in-domain and out-of-domain data in a label-aware manner. Further, we propose a domain-specific prompt learning technique which leverages the training samples of all the available domains based on the the extent they can be useful to the desired domain. Extensive experiments on a large-scale benchmark dataset, namely NewsClippings demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing approaches for this challenging task",

This paper proposes a method that extracts linguistic knowledge via an unsupervised framework and subsequently utilizes this knowledge to augment BERT's performance and interpretability in DST tasks. The knowledge extraction procedure is computationally economical and does not necessitate annotations or additional training data. The injection of the extracted knowledge necessitates the addition of only simple neural modules. We employ the Convex Polytopic Model (CPM) as a feature extraction tool for DST tasks and illustrate that the acquired features correlate with the syntactic and semantic patterns in the dialogues. This correlation facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic features influencing the DST model's decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on various DST tasks and observe a notable improvement in accuracy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Blockchain-empowered federated learning (FL) has provoked extensive research recently. Various blockchain-based federated learning algorithm, architecture and mechanism have been designed to solve issues like single point failure and data falsification brought by centralized FL paradigm. Moreover, it is easier to allocate incentives to nodes with the help of the blockchain. Various centralized federated learning frameworks like FedML, have emerged in the community to help boost the research on FL. However, decentralized blockchain-based federated learning framework is still missing, which cause inconvenience for researcher to reproduce or verify the algorithm performance based on blockchain. Inspired by the above issues, we have designed and developed a blockchain-based federated learning framework by embedding Ethereum network. This report will present the overall structure of this framework, which proposes a code practice paradigm for the combination of FL with blockchain and, at the same time, compatible with normal FL training task. In addition to implement some blockchain federated learning algorithms on smart contract to help execute a FL training, we also propose a model ownership authentication architecture based on blockchain and model watermarking to protect the intellectual property rights of models. These mechanism on blockchain shows an underlying support of blockchain for federated learning to provide a verifiable training, aggregation and incentive distribution procedure and thus we named this framework VeryFL (A Verify Federated Learninig Framework Embedded with Blockchain).

    "abstract": "This study proposes the first Bayesian approach for learning high-dimensional linear Bayesian networks. The proposed approach iteratively estimates each element of the topological ordering from backward and its parent using the inverse of a partial covariance matrix. The proposed method successfully recovers the underlying structure when Bayesian regularization for the inverse covariance matrix with unequal shrinkage is applied. Specifically, it shows that the number of samples $n = \\Omega( d_M^2 \\log p)$ and $n = \\Omega(d_M^2 p^{2/m})$ are sufficient for the proposed algorithm to learn linear Bayesian networks with sub-Gaussian and 4m-th bounded-moment error distributions, respectively, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $d_M$ is the maximum degree of the moralized graph. The theoretical findings are supported by extensive simulation studies including real data analysis. Furthermore the proposed method is demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art frequentist approaches, such as the BHLSM, LISTEN, and TD algorithms in synthetic data",

    "abstract": "Federated Unlearning (FU) aims to delete specific training data from an ML model trained using Federated Learning (FL). We introduce QuickDrop, an efficient and original FU method that utilizes dataset distillation (DD) to accelerate unlearning and drastically reduces computational overhead compared to existing approaches. In QuickDrop, each client uses DD to generate a compact dataset representative of the original training dataset, called a distilled dataset, and uses this compact dataset during unlearning. To unlearn specific knowledge from the global model, QuickDrop has clients execute Stochastic Gradient Ascent with samples from the distilled datasets, thus significantly reducing computational overhead compared to conventional FU methods. We further increase the efficiency of QuickDrop by ingeniously integrating DD into the FL training process. By reusing the gradient updates produced during FL training for DD, the overhead of creating distilled datasets becomes close to negligible. Evaluations on three standard datasets show that, with comparable accuracy guarantees, QuickDrop reduces the duration of unlearning by 463.8x compared to model retraining from scratch and 65.1x compared to existing FU approaches. We also demonstrate the scalability of QuickDrop with 100 clients and show its effectiveness while handling multiple unlearning operations",

Network clustering must be accompanied by node community detection. Our proposed algorithm achieves the minimax optimal network clustering error rate and allows extreme network sparsity under MMSBM. Numerical simulations and real data experiments both validate that our method outperforms existing methods. Oftentimes, the edges of networks carry count-type weights. We then extend our methodology and analysis framework to study the minimax optimal clustering error rate for mixture of discrete distributions including Binomial, Poisson, and multi-layer Poisson networks. The minimax optimal clustering error rates in these discrete mixtures all take the same exponential form characterized by the Renyi divergences.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-kernel convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have recently received extensive research attention, but there are two unresolved and critical issues that demand further investigation. 1) The architectures of existing large-kernel ConvNets largely follow the design principles of conventional ConvNets or transformers, while the architectural design for large-kernel ConvNets remains under-addressed. 2) As transformers have dominated multiple modalities, it remains to be investigated whether ConvNets also have a strong universal perception ability in domains beyond vision. In this paper, we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large-kernel ConvNets, the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Following such guidelines, our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition. For example, our models achieve an ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and COCO box AP of 56.4%, demonstrating better performance and higher speed than a number of recently proposed powerful competitors. 2) We discover that large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient. With certain modality-related preprocessing approaches, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on time-series forecasting and audio recognition tasks even without modality-specific customization to the architecture.

Specifically, we examine the dynamics of a system coupled with an infinite heat bath. This interaction induces both random quantum noise and a deterministic damping effect to the system, which nudge the system towards a steady state that hovers near the global minimum of objective functions. We theoretically prove the convergence of QLD in convex landscapes, demonstrating that the average energy of the system can approach zero in the low temperature limit with an exponential decay rate correlated with the evolution time. Numerically, we first show the energy dissipation capability of QLD by retracing its origins to spontaneous emission. Furthermore, we conduct detailed discussion of the impact of each parameter. Finally, based on the observations when comparing QLD with classical Fokker-Plank-Smoluchowski equation, we propose a time-dependent QLD by making temperature and $\\hbar$ time-dependent parameters, which can be theoretically proven to converge better than the time-independent case and also outperforms a series of state-of-the-art quantum and classical optimization algorithms in many non-convex landscapes",

In this work, we explore this gap by adapting a pre-trained language model for auto-regressive text-to-image generation, and find that pre-trained language models offer limited help. We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models' capability",

To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of indoor positioning interpolation techniques, this paper proposes a simple yet powerful geometric-aware interpolation algorithm for indoor positioning tasks. The key to our algorithm is to exploit the geometric attributes of the local topological manifold using manifold learning principles. Therefore, instead of constructing complicated mathematical models, the proposed algorithm facilitates the more precise and efficient estimation of points grounded in the local topological manifold. Moreover, our proposed method can be effortlessly integrated into any indoor positioning system, thereby bolstering its adaptability. Through a systematic array of experiments and comprehensive performance analyses conducted on both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms the most commonly used and representative interpolation approaches regarding interpolation accuracy and efficiency.

    "abstract": "The Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice is a widely employed tool in clinical voice quality assessment that is significant for streaming communication among clinical professionals and benchmarking for the determination of further treatment. Currently, because the assessment relies on experienced clinicians, it tends to be inconsistent, and thus, difficult to standardize. To address this problem, we propose to leverage lightly weighted automatic audio parameter extraction, to increase the clinical relevance, reduce the complexity, and enhance the interpretability of voice quality assessment. The proposed method utilizes age, sex, and five audio parameters: jitter, absolute jitter, shimmer, harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR), and zero crossing. A classical machine learning approach is employed. The result reveals that our approach performs similar to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, and outperforms the latent representation obtained by using popular audio pre-trained models. This approach provide insights into the feasibility of different feature extraction approaches for voice evaluation. Audio parameters such as jitter and the HNR are proven to be suitable for characterizing voice quality attributes, such as roughness and strain. Conversely, pre-trained models exhibit limitations in effectively addressing noise-related scorings.

Nevertheless, the relative performance of these methods remains unclear. Existing experimental comparisons only cover a subset of these methods and focus on limited metrics. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive comparative analysis and experimental evaluation of embedding compression. We introduce a new taxonomy that categorizes these techniques based on their characteristics and methodologies, and further develop a modular benchmarking framework that integrates 14 representative methods. Under a uniform test environment, our benchmark fairly evaluates each approach, presents their strengths and weaknesses under different memory budgets, and recommends the best method based on the use case.

In this work, we propose a more practical scenario named Universal Federated Domain Adaptation (UFDA). It only requires the black-box model and the label set information of each source domain, while the label sets of different source domains could be inconsistent and the target-domain label set is totally blind. This relaxes the assumptions made by FDA, which are often challenging to meet in real-world cases and diminish model security. To address the UFDA scenario, we propose a corresponding framework called Hot-Learning with Contrastive Label Disambiguation (HCLD), which tackles UFDA's domain shifts and category gaps problem by using one-hot outputs from the black-box models of various source domains. Moreover, to better distinguish the shared and unknown classes, we further present a cluster-level strategy named Mutual-Voting Decision (MVD) to extract robust consensus knowledge across peer classes from both source and target domains. The extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our HCLD achieves comparable performance for our UFDA scenario with much fewer assumptions, compared to the previous methodologies with many additional assumptions",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The high computational and memory requirements of generative large language models (LLMs) make it challenging to serve them cheaply. This paper aims to reduce the monetary cost for serving LLMs by leveraging preemptible GPU instances on modern clouds, which offer accesses to spare GPUs at a much cheaper price than regular instances but may be preempted by the cloud at any time. Serving LLMs on preemptible instances requires addressing challenges induced by frequent instance preemptions and the necessity of migrating instances to handle these preemptions. This paper presents SpotServe, the first distributed LLM serving system on preemptible instances. Several key techniques in SpotServe realize fast and reliable serving of generative LLMs on cheap preemptible instances. First, SpotServe dynamically adapts the LLM parallelization configuration for dynamic instance availability and fluctuating workload, while balancing the trade-off among the overall throughput, inference latency and monetary costs. Second, to minimize the cost of migrating instances for dynamic reparallelization, the task of migrating instances is formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem, which uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to identify an optimal migration plan that minimizes communications. Finally, to take advantage of the grace period offered by modern clouds, we introduce stateful inference recovery, a new inference mechanism that commits inference progress at a much finer granularity and allows SpotServe to cheaply resume inference upon preemption. We evaluate on real spot instance preemption traces and various popular LLMs and show that SpotServe can reduce the P99 tail latency by 2.4 - 9.1x compared with the best existing LLM serving systems. We also show that SpotServe can leverage the price advantage of preemptive instances, saving 54% monetary cost compared with only using on-demand instances",

Existing autoregressive models such as G-SchNet and G-SphereNet for molecules utilize rotationally invariant features to respect the 3D symmetries of molecules. In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree $E(3)$-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules. We show that Symphony is able to accurately generate small molecules from the QM9 dataset, outperforming existing autoregressive models and approaching the performance of diffusion models",

    "title": "From Prediction to Action: The Critical Role of Proper Performance Estimation for Machine-Learning-Driven Materials Discovery",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Materials discovery driven by statistical property models is an iterative decision process, during which an initial data collection is extended with new data proposed by a model-informed acquisition function--with the goal to maximize a certain \"reward\" over time, such as the maximum property value discovered so far. While the materials science community achieved much progress in developing property models that predict well on average with respect to the training distribution, this form of in-distribution performance measurement is not directly coupled with the discovery reward. This is because an iterative discovery process has a shifting reward distribution that is over-proportionally determined by the model performance for exceptional materials. We demonstrate this problem using the example of bulk modulus maximization among double perovskite oxides. We find that the in-distribution predictive performance suggests random forests as superior to Gaussian process regression, while the results are inverse in terms of the discovery rewards. We argue that the lack of proper performance estimation methods from pre-computed data collections is a fundamental problem for improving data-driven materials discovery, and we propose a novel such estimator that, in contrast to na\\\"ive reward estimation, successfully predicts Gaussian processes with the \"expected improvement\" acquisition function as the best out of four options in our demonstrational study for double perovskites. Importantly, it does so without requiring the over thousand ab initio computations that were needed to confirm this prediction",

Despite the growing concerns, there has been a lack of empirical investigation. In this paper, we provide an empirical examination of LLMs' hallucination behaviors in financial tasks. First, we empirically investigate LLM model's ability of explaining financial concepts and terminologies. Second, we assess LLM models' capacity of querying historical stock prices. Third, to alleviate the hallucination issue, we evaluate the efficacy of four practical methods, including few-shot learning, Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), the Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) method and the prompt-based tool learning method for a function to generate a query command. Finally, our major finding is that off-the-shelf LLMs experience serious hallucination behaviors in financial tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset distillation (DD) is a newly emerging research area aiming at alleviating the heavy computational load in training models on large datasets. It tries to distill a large dataset into a small and condensed one so that models trained on the distilled dataset can perform comparably with those trained on the full dataset when performing downstream tasks. Among the previous works in this area, there are three key problems that hinder the performance and availability of the existing DD methods: high time complexity, high space complexity, and low info-compactness. In this work, we simultaneously attempt to settle these three problems by moving the DD processes from conventionally used pixel space to latent space. Encoded by a pretrained generic autoencoder, latent codes in the latent space are naturally info-compact representations of the original images in much smaller sizes. After transferring three mainstream DD algorithms to latent space, we significantly reduce time and space consumption while achieving similar performance, allowing us to distill high-resolution datasets or target at greater data ratio that previous methods have failed. Besides, within the same storage budget, we can also quantitatively deliver more latent codes than pixel-level images, which further boosts the performance of our methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human albumin is essential for indicating the body's overall health. Accurately predicting plasma albumin levels and determining appropriate doses are urgent clinical challenges, particularly in critically ill patients, to maintain optimal blood levels. However, human albumin prediction is non-trivial that has to leverage the dynamics of biochemical markers as well as the experience of treating patients. Moreover, the problem of distribution shift is often encountered in real clinical data, which may lead to a decline in the model prediction performance and reduce the reliability of the model's application. In this paper, we propose a framework named Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction (DyG-HAP), which is able to provide accurate albumin predictions for Intensity Care Unit (ICU) patients during hospitalization. We first model human albumin prediction as a dynamic graph regression problem to model the dynamics and patient relationship. Then, we propose a disentangled dynamic graph attention mechanism to capture and disentangle the patterns whose relationship to labels under distribution shifts is invariant and variant respectively. Last, we propose an invariant dynamic graph regression method to encourage the model to rely on invariant patterns to make predictions. Moreover, we propose a dataset named Albumin level testing and nutritional dosing data for Intensive Care (ANIC) for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to several baseline methods in human albumin prediction",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Background and Objective: The lack of benchmark datasets has impeded the development of slice-to-volume registration algorithms. Such datasets are difficult to annotate, primarily due to the dimensional difference within data and the dearth of task-specific software. We aim to develop a user-friendly tool to streamline dataset annotation for slice-to-volume registration. Methods: The proposed tool, named SVRDA, is an installation-free web application for platform-agnostic collaborative dataset annotation. It enables efficient transformation manipulation via keyboard shortcuts and smooth case transitions with auto-saving. SVRDA supports configuration-based data loading and adheres to the separation of concerns, offering great flexibility and extensibility for future research. Various supplementary features have been implemented to facilitate slice-to-volume registration. Results: We validated the effectiveness of SVRDA by indirectly evaluating the post-registration segmentation quality on UK Biobank data, observing a dramatic overall improvement (24.02% in the Dice Similarity Coefficient and 48.93% in the 95th percentile Hausdorff distance, respectively) supported by highly statistically significant evidence ($p<0.001$).We further showcased the clinical usage of SVRDA by integrating it into test-retest T1 quantification on in-house magnetic resonance images, leading to more consistent results after registration. Conclusions: SVRDA can facilitate collaborative annotation of benchmark datasets while being potentially applicable to other pipelines incorporating slice-to-volume registration.

    "abstract": "The acquisition of accurate rainfall distribution in space is an important task in hydrological analysis and natural disaster pre-warning. However, it is impossible to install rain gauges on every corner. Spatial interpolation is a common way to infer rainfall distribution based on available raingauge data. However, the existing works rely on some unrealistic pre-settings to capture spatial correlations, which limits their performance in real scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose the SSIN, which is a novel data-driven self-supervised learning framework for rainfall spatial interpolation by mining latent spatial patterns from historical observation data. Inspired by the Cloze task and BERT, we fully consider the characteristics of spatial interpolation and design the SpaFormer model based on the Transformer architecture as the core of SSIN. Our main idea is: by constructing rich self-supervision signals via random masking, SpaFormer can learn informative embeddings for raw data and then adaptively model spatial correlations based on rainfall spatial context. Extensive experiments on two real-world raingauge datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. In addition, we take traffic spatial interpolation as another use case to further explore the performance of our method, and SpaFormer achieves the best performance on one large real-world traffic dataset, which further confirms the effectiveness and generality of our method",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As an important clean and renewable kind of energy, wind power plays an important role in coping with energy crisis and environmental pollution. However, the volatility and intermittency of wind speed restrict the development of wind power. To improve the utilization of wind power, this study proposes a new wind speed prediction model based on data noise reduction technology, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and gated recurrent unit (GRU). Firstly, an adaptive data noise reduction algorithm P-SSA is proposed based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and Pearson correlation coefficient. The original wind speed is decomposed into multiple subsequences by SSA and then reconstructed. When the Pearson correlation coefficient between the reconstructed sequence and the original sequence is greater than 0.99, other noise subsequences are deleted to complete the data denoising. Then, the receptive field of the samples is expanded through the causal convolution and dilated convolution of TCN, and the characteristics of wind speed change are extracted. Then, the time feature information of the sequence is extracted by GRU, and then the wind speed is predicted to form the wind speed sequence prediction model of P-SSA-TCN-GRU. The proposed model was validated on three wind farms in Shandong Province. The experimental results show that the prediction performance of the proposed model is better than that of the traditional model and other models based on TCN, and the wind speed prediction of wind farms with high precision and strong stability is realized. The wind speed predictions of this model have the potential to become the data that support the operation and management of wind farms. The code is available at link",

    "abstract": "Electroanatomical mapping is a technique used in cardiology to create a detailed 3D map of the electrical activity in the heart. It is useful for diagnosis, treatment planning and real time guidance in cardiac ablation procedures to treat arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation. A probabilistic machine learning model trained on a library of CT/MRI scans of the heart can be used during electroanatomical mapping to generate a patient-specific 3D model of the chamber being mapped. The use of probabilistic machine learning models under a Bayesian framework provides a way to quantify uncertainty in results and provide a natural framework of interpretability of the model. Here we introduce a Bayesian approach to surface reconstruction of cardiac chamber models from a sparse 3D point cloud data acquired during electroanatomical mapping. We show how probabilistic graphical models trained on segmented CT/MRI data can be used to generate cardiac chamber models from few acquired locations thereby reducing procedure time and x-ray exposure. We show how they provide insight into what the neural network learns from the segmented CT/MRI images used to train the network, which provides explainability to the resulting cardiac chamber models generated by the model",

    "abstract": "Fault detection and diagnosis of electrical motors are of utmost importance in ensuring the safe and reliable operation of several industrial systems. Detection and diagnosis of faults at the incipient stage allows corrective actions to be taken in order to reduce the severity of faults. The existing data-driven deep learning approaches for machine fault diagnosis rely extensively on huge amounts of labeled samples, where annotations are expensive and time-consuming. However, a major portion of unlabeled condition monitoring data is not exploited in the training process. To overcome this limitation, we propose a foundational model-based Active Learning framework that utilizes less amount of labeled samples, which are most informative and harnesses a large amount of available unlabeled data by effectively combining Active Learning and Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning techniques. It consists of a transformer network-based backbone model trained using an advanced nearest-neighbor contrastive self-supervised learning method. This approach empowers the backbone to learn improved representations of samples derived from raw, unlabeled vibration data. Subsequently, the backbone can undergo fine-tuning to address a range of downstream tasks, both within the same machines and across different machines. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology has been assessed through the fine-tuning of the backbone for multiple target tasks using three distinct machine-bearing fault datasets. The experimental evaluation demonstrates a superior performance as compared to existing state-of-the-art fault diagnosis methods with less amount of labeled data",

    "abstract": "Complementary-label learning is a weakly supervised learning problem in which each training example is associated with one or multiple complementary labels indicating the classes to which it does not belong. Existing consistent approaches have relied on the uniform distribution assumption to model the generation of complementary labels, or on an ordinary-label training set to estimate the transition matrix. However, both conditions may not be satisfied in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel complementary-label learning approach that does not rely on these conditions. We find that complementary-label learning can be expressed as a set of negative-unlabeled binary classification problems when using the one-versus-rest strategy. This observation allows us to propose a risk-consistent approach with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, we introduce a risk correction approach to address overfitting problems when using complex models. We also prove the statistical consistency and convergence rate of the corrected risk estimator.

Generating computer programs in general-purpose programming languages like Python poses a challenge for LLMs when instructed to use code provided in the prompt. Code-specific LLMs (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CodeLlama2) can generate code completions in real-time by drawing on all code available in a development environment. However, restricting code-specific LLMs to use only in-context code is not straightforward, as the model is not explicitly instructed to use the user-provided code and users cannot highlight precisely which snippets of code the model should incorporate into its context. Moreover, current systems lack effective recovery methods, forcing users to iteratively re-prompt the model with modified prompts until a sufficient solution is reached. Our method differs from traditional LLM-powered code-generation by constraining code-generation to an explicit function set and enabling recovery from failed attempts through automatically generated sub-functions. When the LLM cannot produce working code, we generate modular sub-functions to aid subsequent attempts at generating functional code. A by-product of our method is a library of reusable sub-functions that can solve related tasks, imitating a software team where efficiency scales with experience. We also introduce a new \"half-shot\" evaluation paradigm that provides tighter estimates of LLMs' coding abilities compared to traditional zero-shot evaluation. Our proposed evaluation method encourages models to output solutions in a structured format, decreasing syntax errors that can be mistaken for poor coding ability",

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) aims to acquire new knowledge while preserving information from previous experiences without forgetting. Though buffer-based methods (i.e., retaining samples from previous tasks) have achieved acceptable performance, determining how to allocate the buffer remains a critical challenge. Most recent research focuses on refining these methods but often fails to sufficiently consider the varying influence of samples on the learning process, and frequently overlooks the complexity of the classes/concepts being learned. Generally, these methods do not directly take into account the contribution of individual classes. However, our investigation indicates that more challenging classes necessitate preserving a larger number of samples compared to less challenging ones. To address this issue, we propose a novel method and policy named 'Class-Adaptive Sampling Policy' (CASP), which dynamically allocates storage space within the buffer. By utilizing concepts of class contribution and difficulty, CASP adaptively manages buffer space, allowing certain classes to occupy a larger portion of the buffer while reducing storage for others. This approach significantly improves the efficiency of knowledge retention and utilization. CASP provides a versatile solution to boost the performance and efficiency of CL. It meets the demand for dynamic buffer allocation, accommodating the varying contributions of different classes and their learning complexities over time",

    "abstract": "There has recently been a sharp increase in interest in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). Despite this, musical components such as time signatures have not been studied sufficiently to form an algorithmic determination approach for new compositions, especially lyrical songs. This is likely because of the neglect of musical details, which is critical for constructing a robust framework. Specifically, time signatures establish the fundamental rhythmic structure for almost all aspects of a song, including the phrases and notes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that only uses lyrics as input to automatically generate a fitting time signature for lyrical songs and uncover the latent rhythmic structure utilizing explainable machine learning models. In particular, we devise multiple methods that are associated with discovering lyrical patterns and creating new features that simultaneously contain lyrical, rhythmic, and statistical information. In this approach, the best of our experimental results reveal a 97.6% F1 score and a 0.996 Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) score.

Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods, with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Big Data empowers the farming community with the information needed to optimize resource usage, increase productivity, and enhance the sustainability of agricultural practices. The use of Big Data in farming requires the collection and analysis of data from various sources such as sensors, satellites, and farmer surveys. While Big Data can provide the farming community with valuable insights and improve efficiency, there is significant concern regarding the security of this data as well as the privacy of the participants. Privacy regulations, such as the EU GDPR, the EU Code of Conduct on agricultural data sharing by contractual agreement, and the proposed EU AI law, have been created to address the issue of data privacy and provide specific guidelines on when and how data can be shared between organizations. To make confidential agricultural data widely available for Big Data analysis without violating the privacy of the data subjects, we consider privacy-preserving methods of data sharing in agriculture. Deep learning-based synthetic data generation has been proposed for privacy-preserving data sharing. However, there is a lack of compliance with documented data privacy policies in such privacy-preserving efforts. In this study, we propose a novel framework for enforcing privacy policy rules in privacy-preserving data generation algorithms.

GNNs excel at capturing those relationships and patterns within these graphs, enabling effective learning and prediction tasks. GNNs are constructed using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and incorporate additional layers for message passing to facilitate the flow of features among nodes. It is commonly believed that the generalizing power of GNNs is attributed to the message-passing mechanism between layers, where nodes exchange information with their neighbors, enabling them to effectively capture and propagate information across the nodes of a graph. Our technique builds on these results, modifying the message-passing mechanism further: one by weighing the messages before accumulating at each node and another by adding Residual connections. These two mechanisms show significant improvements in learning and faster convergence",

Specifically, these approaches propose to maintain a set of prompts and allocate a subset of them to learn each task using a key-query matching strategy. However, they may encounter limitations when lacking control over the correlations between old task queries and keys of future tasks, the shift of features in the latent space, and the relative separation of latent vectors learned in independent tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel key-query learning strategy based on orthogonal projection, inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, to enhance prompt matching efficiency and address the challenge of shifting features. Furthermore, we introduce a One-Versus-All (OVA) prototype-based component that enhances the classification head distinction.

    "abstract": "Constrained clustering allows the training of classification models using pairwise constraints only, which are weak and relatively easy to mine, while still yielding full-supervision-level model performance. While they perform well even in the absence of the true underlying class labels, constrained clustering models still require large amounts of binary constraint annotations for training. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised context whereby a large amount of \\textit{unconstrained} data is available alongside a smaller set of constraints, and propose \\textit{ConstraintMatch} to leverage such unconstrained data. While a great deal of progress has been made in semi-supervised learning using full labels, there are a number of challenges that prevent a naive application of the resulting methods in the constraint-based label setting. Therefore, we reason about and analyze these challenges, specifically 1) proposing a \\textit{pseudo-constraining} mechanism to overcome the confirmation bias, a major weakness of pseudo-labeling, 2) developing new methods for pseudo-labeling towards the selection of \\textit{informative} unconstrained samples, 3) showing that this also allows the use of pairwise loss functions for the initial and auxiliary losses which facilitates semi-constrained model training. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ConstraintMatch over relevant baselines in both the regular clustering and overclustering scenarios on five challenging benchmarks and provide analyses of its several components",

    "title": "Local Convergence of Approximate Newton Method for Two Layer Nonlinear Regression",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There have been significant advancements made by large language models (LLMs) in various aspects of our daily lives. LLMs serve as a transformative force in natural language processing, finding applications in text generation, translation, sentiment analysis, and question-answering. The accomplishments of LLMs have led to a substantial increase in research efforts in this domain. One specific two-layer regression problem has been well-studied in prior works, where the first layer is activated by a ReLU unit, and the second layer is activated by a softmax unit. While previous works provide a solid analysis of building a two-layer regression, there is still a gap in the analysis of constructing regression problems with more than two layers. In this paper, we take a crucial step toward addressing this problem: we provide an analysis of a two-layer regression problem. In contrast to previous works, our first layer is activated by a softmax unit. This sets the stage for future analyses of creating more activation functions based on the softmax function. Rearranging the softmax function leads to significantly different analyses. Our main results involve analyzing the convergence properties of an approximate Newton method used to minimize the regularized training loss. We prove that the loss function for the Hessian matrix is positive definite and Lipschitz continuous under certain assumptions. This enables us to establish local convergence guarantees for the proposed training algorithm. Specifically, with an appropriate initialization and after $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations, our algorithm can find an $\\epsilon$-approximate minimizer of the training loss with high probability. Each iteration requires approximately $O(\\mathrm{nnz}(C) + d^\\omega)$ time, where $d$ is the model size, $C$ is the input matrix, and $\\omega < 2.374$ is the matrix multiplication exponent",

Theory and Methods: A quarter of the typically acquired number of transients collected in GABA-edited MRS scans are pre-processed and converted to a spectrogram image representation using the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The image representation of the data allows the adaptation of a pre-trained ViT for reconstructing GABA-edited MRS spectra (Spectro-ViT). The Spectro-ViT is fine-tuned and then tested using \\textit{in vivo} GABA-edited MRS data. The Spectro-ViT performance is compared against other models in the literature using spectral quality metrics and estimated metabolite concentration values. Results: The Spectro-ViT model significantly outperformed all other models in four out of five quantitative metrics (mean squared error, shape score, GABA+/water fit error, and full width at half maximum). The metabolite concentrations estimated (GABA+/water, GABA+/Cr, and Glx/water) were consistent with the metabolite concentrations estimated using typical GABA-edited MRS scans reconstructed with the full amount of typically collected transients. Conclusion: The proposed Spectro-ViT model achieved state-of-the-art results in reconstructing GABA-edited MRS, and the results indicate these scans could be up to four times faster",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Clustering stands as one of the most prominent challenges within the realm of unsupervised machine learning. Among the array of centroid-based clustering algorithms, the classic $k$-means algorithm, rooted in Lloyd's heuristic, takes center stage as one of the extensively employed techniques in the literature. Nonetheless, both $k$-means and its variants grapple with noteworthy limitations. These encompass a heavy reliance on initial cluster centroids, susceptibility to converging into local minima of the objective function, and sensitivity to outliers and noise in the data. When confronted with data containing noisy or outlier-laden observations, the Median-of-Means (MoM) estimator emerges as a stabilizing force for any centroid-based clustering framework. On a different note, a prevalent constraint among existing clustering methodologies resides in the prerequisite knowledge of the number of clusters prior to analysis. Utilizing model-based methodologies, such as Bayesian nonparametric models, offers the advantage of infinite mixture models, thereby circumventing the need for such requirements. Motivated by these facts, in this article, we present an efficient and automatic clustering technique by integrating the principles of model-based and centroid-based methodologies that mitigates the effect of noise on the quality of clustering while ensuring that the number of clusters need not be specified in advance. Statistical guarantees on the upper bound of clustering error, and rigorous assessment through simulated and real datasets suggest the advantages of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) with a single global server framework is currently a popular approach for training machine learning models on decentralized environment, such as mobile devices and edge devices. However, the centralized server architecture poses a risk as any challenge on the central/global server would result in the failure of the entire system. To minimize this risk, we propose a novel federated learning framework that leverages the deployment of multiple global servers. We posit that implementing multiple global servers in federated learning can enhance efficiency by capitalizing on local collaborations and aggregating knowledge, and the error tolerance in regard to communication failure in the single server framework would be handled. We therefore propose a novel framework that leverages the deployment of multiple global servers. We conducted a series of experiments using a dataset containing the event history of electric vehicle (EV) charging at numerous stations. We deployed a federated learning setup with multiple global servers and client servers, where each client-server strategically represented a different region and a global server was responsible for aggregating local updates from those devices. Our preliminary results of the global models demonstrate that the difference in performance attributed to multiple servers is less than 1%. While the hypothesis of enhanced model efficiency was not as expected, the rule for handling communication challenges added to the algorithm could resolve the error tolerance issue. Future research can focus on identifying specific uses for the deployment of multiple global servers",

    "abstract": "In this evolving era of machine learning security, membership inference attacks have emerged as a potent threat to the confidentiality of sensitive data. In this attack, adversaries aim to determine whether a particular point was used during the training of a target model. This paper proposes a new method to gauge a data point's membership in a model's training set. Instead of correlating loss with membership, as is traditionally done, we have leveraged the fact that training examples generally exhibit higher confidence values when classified into their actual class. During training, the model is essentially being 'fit' to the training data and might face particular difficulties in generalization to unseen data. This asymmetry leads to the model achieving higher confidence on the training data as it exploits the specific patterns and noise present in the training data. Our proposed approach leverages the confidence values generated by the machine learning model. These confidence values provide a probabilistic measure of the model's certainty in its predictions and can further be used to infer the membership of a given data point. Additionally, we also introduce another variant of our method that allows us to carry out this attack without knowing the ground truth(true class) of a given data point, thus offering an edge over existing label-dependent attack methods",

    "abstract": "Many problems in Reinforcement Learning (RL) seek an optimal policy with large discrete multidimensional yet unordered action spaces; these include problems in randomized allocation of resources such as placements of multiple security resources and emergency response units, etc. A challenge in this setting is that the underlying action space is categorical (discrete and unordered) and large, for which existing RL methods do not perform well. Moreover, these problems require validity of the realized action (allocation); this validity constraint is often difficult to express compactly in a closed mathematical form. The allocation nature of the problem also prefers stochastic optimal policies, if one exists. In this work, we address these challenges by (1) applying a (state) conditional normalizing flow to compactly represent the stochastic policy -- the compactness arises due to the network only producing one sampled action and the corresponding log probability of the action, which is then used by an actor-critic method; and (2) employing an invalid action rejection method (via a valid action oracle) to update the base policy. The action rejection is enabled by a modified policy gradient that we derive. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the scalability of our approach compared to prior methods and the ability to enforce arbitrary state-conditional constraints on the support of the distribution of actions in any state",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks meticulously generate minuscule, imperceptible perturbations to images to deceive neural networks. Counteracting these, adversarial purification methods seek to transform adversarial input samples into clean output images to defend against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, extent generative models fail to effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations, yielding less-than-ideal purification results. We emphasize the potential threat of residual adversarial perturbations to target models, quantitatively establishing a relationship between perturbation scale and attack capability. Notably, the residual perturbations on the purified image primarily stem from the same-position patch and similar patches of the adversarial sample. We propose a novel adversarial purification approach named Information Mask Purification (IMPure), aims to extensively eliminate adversarial perturbations. To obtain an adversarial sample, we first mask part of the patches information, then reconstruct the patches to resist adversarial perturbations from the patches. We reconstruct all patches in parallel to obtain a cohesive image. Then, in order to protect the purified samples against potential similar regional perturbations, we simulate this risk by randomly mixing the purified samples with the input samples before inputting them into the feature extraction network. Finally, we establish a combined constraint of pixel loss and perceptual loss to augment the model's reconstruction adaptability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset with three classifier models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results against nine adversarial attack methods.

To reduce this computational inefficiency, we introduce the TOken REcycling (TORE) modification for the ViT inference, which can be used with any architecture. TORE divides ViT into two parts, iterator and aggregator. An iterator processes sequential information separately into midway tokens, which are cached. The aggregator processes midway tokens jointly to obtain the prediction. This way, we can reuse the results of computations made by iterator. Except for efficient sequential inference, we propose a complementary training policy, which significantly reduces the computational burden associated with sequential decision-making while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the context of deep learning research, where model introductions continually occur, the need for effective and efficient evaluation remains paramount. Existing methods often emphasize accuracy metrics, overlooking stability. To address this, the paper introduces the Accuracy-Stability Index (ASI), a quantitative measure incorporating both accuracy and stability for assessing deep learning models. Experimental results demonstrate the application of ASI, and a 3D surface model is presented for visualizing ASI, mean accuracy, and coefficient of variation. This paper addresses the important issue of quantitative benchmarking metrics for deep learning models, providing a new approach for accurately evaluating accuracy and stability of deep learning models. The paper concludes with discussions on potential weaknesses and outlines future research directions",

    "abstract": "The collection of data to train a Deep Learning network is costly in terms of effort and resources. In many cases, especially in a medical context, it may have detrimental impacts. Such as requiring invasive medical procedures or processes which could in themselves cause medical harm. However, Deep Learning is seen as a data hungry method. Here, we look at two commonly held adages i) more data gives better results and ii) transfer learning will aid you when you don't have enough data. These are widely assumed to be true and used as evidence for choosing how to solve a problem when Deep Learning is involved. We evaluate six medical datasets and six general datasets. Training a ResNet18 network on varying subsets of these datasets to evaluate `more data gives better results'. We take eleven of these datasets as the sources for Transfer Learning on subsets of the twelfth dataset -- Chest -- in order to determine whether Transfer Learning is universally beneficial. We go further to see whether multi-stage Transfer Learning provides a consistent benefit. Our analysis shows that the real situation is more complex than these simple adages -- more data could lead to a case of diminishing returns and an incorrect choice of dataset for transfer learning can lead to worse performance, with datasets which we would consider highly similar to the Chest dataset giving worse results than datasets which are more dissimilar. Multi-stage transfer learning likewise reveals complex relationships between datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The reinforcement learning algorithms have often been applied to social robots. However, most reinforcement learning algorithms were not optimized for the use of social robots, and consequently they may bore users. We proposed a new reinforcement learning method specialized for the social robot, the FRAC-Q-learning, that can avoid user boredom. The proposed algorithm consists of a forgetting process in addition to randomizing and categorizing processes. This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional Q-learning. Therefore, the FRAC-Q-learning can contribute to develop a social robot that will not bore users. The proposed algorithm can also find applications in Web-based communication and educational systems. This paper presents the entire process, detailed implementation and a detailed evaluation method of the of the FRAC-Q-learning for the first time",

    "title": "A Foundational Framework and Methodology for Personalized Early and Timely Diagnosis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Early diagnosis of diseases holds the potential for deep transformation in healthcare by enabling better treatment options, improving long-term survival and quality of life, and reducing overall cost. With the advent of medical big data, advances in diagnostic tests as well as in machine learning and statistics, early or timely diagnosis seems within reach. Early diagnosis research often neglects the potential for optimizing individual diagnostic paths. To enable personalized early diagnosis, a foundational framework is needed that delineates the diagnosis process and systematically identifies the time-dependent value of various diagnostic tests for an individual patient given their unique characteristics. Here, we propose the first foundational framework for early and timely diagnosis. It builds on decision-theoretic approaches to outline the diagnosis process and integrates machine learning and statistical methodology for estimating the optimal personalized diagnostic path. To describe the proposed framework as well as possibly other frameworks, we provide essential definitions. The development of a foundational framework is necessary for several reasons: 1) formalism provides clarity for the development of decision support tools; 2) observed information can be complemented with estimates of the future patient trajectory; 3) the net benefit of counterfactual diagnostic paths and associated uncertainties can be modeled for individuals 4) 'early' and 'timely' diagnosis can be clearly defined; 5) a mechanism emerges for assessing the value of technologies in terms of their impact on personalized early diagnosis, resulting health outcomes and incurred costs. Finally, we hope that this foundational framework will unlock the long-awaited potential of timely diagnosis and intervention, leading to improved outcomes for patients and higher cost-effectiveness for healthcare systems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for graph representation learning, but their performance heavily relies on abundant task-specific supervision. To reduce labeling requirement, the \"pre-train, prompt\" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Organizations are increasingly recognizing the value of data collaboration for data analytics purposes. Yet, stringent data protection laws prohibit the direct exchange of raw data. To facilitate data collaboration, federated Learning (FL) emerges as a viable solution, which enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a machine learning (ML) model under the supervision of a central server while ensuring the confidentiality of their raw data. However, existing studies have unveiled two main risks: (i) the potential for the server to infer sensitive information from the client's uploaded updates (i.e., model gradients), compromising client input privacy, and (ii) the risk of malicious clients uploading malformed updates to poison the FL model, compromising input integrity. Recent works utilize secure aggregation with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to guarantee input privacy and integrity in FL. Nevertheless, they suffer from extremely low efficiency and, thus, are impractical for real deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel and highly efficient solution RiseFL for secure and verifiable data collaboration, ensuring input privacy and integrity simultaneously.Firstly, we devise a probabilistic integrity check method that significantly reduces the cost of ZKP generation and verification. Secondly, we design a hybrid commitment scheme to satisfy Byzantine robustness with improved performance. Thirdly, we theoretically prove the security guarantee of the proposed solution. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets suggest that our solution is effective and is highly efficient in both client computation and communication. For instance, RiseFL is up to 28x, 53x and 164x faster than three state-of-the-art baselines ACORN, RoFL and EIFFeL for the client computation",

Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) estimate a model's sensitivity and possible biases to a given concept. In this paper, we extend CAVs from post-hoc analysis to ante-hoc training in order to reduce model bias through fine-tuning using an additional Concept Loss. Concepts were defined on the final layer of the network in the past. We generalize it to intermediate layers using class prototypes. This facilitates class learning in the last convolution layer, which is known to be most informative. We also introduce Concept Distillation to create richer concepts using a pre-trained knowledgeable model as the teacher. Our method can sensitize or desensitize a model towards concepts. We show applications of concept-sensitive training to debias several classification problems. We also use concepts to induce prior knowledge into IID, a reconstruction problem.

    "abstract": "Eye diseases have posed significant challenges for decades, but advancements in technology have opened new avenues for their detection and treatment. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in this domain, particularly when combined with Optical Coherent Technology (OCT) imaging. We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from OCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease free (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this work, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The application allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which undergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images are then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception networks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach leverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved classification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict and classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization have been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds significant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby contributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes",

The control policies ensure multiple stakeholders satisfaction including those of trucking companies, terminal operators, and road traffic agencies. The proposed method consists of five integrated modules orchestrated to systematically steer truckers toward choosing those time slots that are expected to result in lower gate waiting times and more cost-effective schedules.

However, existing derivative-free PSL methods are often unstable and inefficient, especially for expensive black-box MOO problems where objective function evaluations are costly. In this work, we propose to address the instability and inefficiency of existing PSL methods with a novel controllable PSL method, called Co-PSL. Particularly, Co-PSL consists of two stages: (1) warm-starting Bayesian optimization to obtain quality Gaussian Processes priors and (2) controllable Pareto set learning to accurately acquire a parametric mapping from preferences to the corresponding Pareto solutions. The former is to help stabilize the PSL process and reduce the number of expensive function evaluations. The latter is to support real-time trade-off control between conflicting objectives. Performances across synthesis and real-world MOO problems showcase the effectiveness of our Co-PSL for expensive multi-objective optimization tasks",

We find that spatial and temporal characteristics are important to capture the types of tours and time-of-day patterns of freight activities. Also, the empirical evidence indicates that carriers in most of the transport markets are sensitive to the level of congestion. Many of them adjust the type of tour, departure time, and the number of stops per tour when facing a congested zone.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proven effective for low-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), the computational cost remains a hurdle in high-dimensional scenarios. This is particularly pronounced when computing high-order and high-dimensional derivatives in the physics-informed loss. Randomized Smoothing PINN (RS-PINN) introduces Gaussian noise for stochastic smoothing of the original neural net model, enabling Monte Carlo methods for derivative approximation, eliminating the need for costly auto-differentiation. Despite its computational efficiency in high dimensions, RS-PINN introduces biases in both loss and gradients, negatively impacting convergence, especially when coupled with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present a comprehensive analysis of biases in RS-PINN, attributing them to the nonlinearity of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and the PDE nonlinearity. We propose tailored bias correction techniques based on the order of PDE nonlinearity. The unbiased RS-PINN allows for a detailed examination of its pros and cons compared to the biased version. Specifically, the biased version has a lower variance and runs faster than the unbiased version, but it is less accurate due to the bias. To optimize the bias-variance trade-off, we combine the two approaches in a hybrid method that balances the rapid convergence of the biased version with the high accuracy of the unbiased version. In addition, we present an enhanced implementation of RS-PINN. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional PDEs, including Fokker-Planck, HJB, viscous Burgers', Allen-Cahn, and Sine-Gordon equations, illustrate the bias-variance trade-off and highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid RS-PINN.

This challenge arises due to the tendency of previously learned weights to be adjusted to suit the objectives of new tasks, resulting in a phenomenon called catastrophic forgetting. Most approaches to this problem seek a balance between maximizing performance on the new tasks and minimizing the forgetting of previous tasks. In contrast, our approach attempts to maximize the performance of the new task, while ensuring zero forgetting. This is accomplished by creating a task-specific modulation parameters for each task. Only these would be learnable parameters during learning of consecutive tasks. Through comprehensive experimental evaluations, our model demonstrates superior performance in acquiring and retaining novel tasks that pose difficulties for other multi-task models.

    "abstract": "Unlike color photography images, which are consistently encoded into RGB channels, biological images encompass various modalities, where the type of microscopy and the meaning of each channel varies with each experiment. Importantly, the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB, as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field, and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention, often ignoring the relationship between channels, yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly, the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study, we propose ChAda-ViT, a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number, order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k, a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities, with a multitude of channel types, and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture, trained in a self-supervised manner, outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally, it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes, channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation.

Furthermore, we innovatively incorporate a segmentation method and multiple training iterations to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive models. Empirical evaluation on the PMH2012 dataset demonstrates that our model, compared to other backbone networks using similar autoregressive approaches, achieves significantly lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Score.

However, they may still face limitations in effectively distinguishing between the most challenging OOD samples that are much like in-distribution (ID) data, i.e., ID-like samples. To this end, we propose a novel OOD detection framework that discovers ID-like outliers using CLIP from the vicinity space of the ID samples, thus helping to identify these most challenging OOD samples. Then a prompt learning framework is proposed that utilizes the identified ID-like outliers to further leverage the capabilities of CLIP for OOD detection. Benefiting from the powerful CLIP, we only need a small number of ID samples to learn the prompts of the model without exposing other auxiliary outlier datasets. By focusing on the most challenging ID-like OOD samples and elegantly exploiting the capabilities of CLIP, our method achieves superior few-shot learning performance on various real-world image datasets (e.g., in 4-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, our method reduces the average FPR95 by 12.16% and improves the average AUROC by 2.76%, compared to state-of-the-art methods)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The exploration-exploitation dilemma has been a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) with complex model classes. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Monotonic Q-Learning with Upper Confidence Bound (MQL-UCB) for RL with general function approximation. Our key algorithmic design includes (1) a general deterministic policy-switching strategy that achieves low switching cost, (2) a monotonic value function structure with carefully controlled function class complexity, and (3) a variance-weighted regression scheme that exploits historical trajectories with high data efficiency. MQL-UCB achieves minimax optimal regret of $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{HK})$ when $K$ is sufficiently large and near-optimal policy switching cost of $\\tilde{O}(dH)$, with $d$ being the eluder dimension of the function class, $H$ being the planning horizon, and $K$ being the number of episodes. Our work sheds light on designing provably sample-efficient and deployment-efficient Q-learning with nonlinear function approximation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In current synthetic aperture radar (SAR) object classification, one of the major challenges is the severe overfitting issue due to the limited dataset (few-shot) and noisy data. Considering the advantages of knowledge distillation as a learned label smoothing regularization, this paper proposes a novel Double Reverse Regularization Network based on Self-Knowledge Distillation (DRRNet-SKD). Specifically, through exploring the effect of distillation weight on the process of distillation, we are inspired to adopt the double reverse thought to implement an effective regularization network by combining offline and online distillation in a complementary way. Then, the Adaptive Weight Assignment (AWA) module is designed to adaptively assign two reverse-changing weights based on the network performance, allowing the student network to better benefit from both teachers. The experimental results on OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship demonstrate that DRRNet-SKD exhibits remarkable performance improvement on classical CNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art self-knowledge distillation methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This research paper focuses on the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the currency trading landscape, positing the development of personalized AI models, essentially functioning as intelligent personal assistants tailored to the idiosyncrasies of individual traders. The paper posits that AI models are capable of identifying nuanced patterns within the trader's historical data, facilitating a more accurate and insightful assessment of psychological risk dynamics in currency trading. The PRI is a dynamic metric that experiences fluctuations in response to market conditions that foster psychological fragility among traders. By employing sophisticated techniques, a classifying decision tree is crafted, enabling clearer decision-making boundaries within the tree structure. By incorporating the user's chronological trade entries, the model becomes adept at identifying critical junctures when psychological risks are heightened. The real-time nature of the calculations enhances the model's utility as a proactive tool, offering timely alerts to traders about impending moments of psychological risks. The implications of this research extend beyond the confines of currency trading, reaching into the realms of other industries where the judicious application of personalized modeling emerges as an efficient and strategic approach. This paper positions itself at the intersection of cutting-edge technology and the intricate nuances of human psychology, offering a transformative paradigm for decision making support in dynamic and high-pressure environments",

    "title": "The Local Landscape of Phase Retrieval Under Limited Samples",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of the local landscape of phase retrieval under the regime with limited samples. Our aim is to ascertain the minimal sample size necessary to guarantee a benign local landscape surrounding global minima in high dimensions. Let $n$ and $d$ denote the sample size and input dimension, respectively. We first explore the local convexity and establish that when $n=o(d\\log d)$, for almost every fixed point in the local ball, the Hessian matrix must have negative eigenvalues as long as $d$ is sufficiently large. Consequently, the local landscape is highly non-convex. We next consider the one-point strong convexity and show that as long as $n=\\omega(d)$, with high probability, the landscape is one-point strongly convex in the local annulus: $\\{w\\in\\mathbb{R}^d: o_d(1)\\leqslant \\|w-w^*\\|\\leqslant c\\}$, where $w^*$ is the ground truth and $c$ is an absolute constant. This implies that gradient descent initialized from any point in this domain can converge to an $o_d(1)$-loss solution exponentially fast. Furthermore, we show that when $n=o(d\\log d)$, there is a radius of $\\widetilde\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{1/d}\\right)$ such that one-point convexity breaks in the corresponding smaller local ball. This indicates an impossibility to establish a convergence to exact $w^*$ for gradient descent under limited samples by relying solely on one-point convexity",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unit commitment (UC) problems are typically formulated as mixed-integer programs (MIP) and solved by the branch-and-bound (B&B) scheme. The recent advances in graph neural networks (GNN) enable it to enhance the B&B algorithm in modern MIP solvers by learning to dive and branch. Existing GNN models that tackle MIP problems are mostly constructed from mathematical formulation, which is computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale UC problems. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hierarchical graph convolutional network (PI-GCN) for neural diving that leverages the underlying features of various components of power systems to find high-quality variable assignments. Furthermore, we adopt the MIP model-based graph convolutional network (MB-GCN) for neural branching to select the optimal variables for branching at each node of the B&B tree. Finally, we integrate neural diving and neural branching into a modern MIP solver to establish a novel neural MIP solver designed for large-scale UC problems. Numeral studies show that PI-GCN has better performance and scalability than the baseline MB-GCN on neural diving. Moreover, the neural MIP solver yields the lowest operational cost and outperforms a modern MIP solver for all testing days after combining it with our proposed neural diving model and the baseline neural branching model",

    "abstract": "Normalized-Cut (N-Cut) is a famous model of spectral clustering. The traditional N-Cut solvers are two-stage: 1) calculating the continuous spectral embedding of normalized Laplacian matrix; 2) discretization via $K$-means or spectral rotation. However, this paradigm brings two vital problems: 1) two-stage methods solve a relaxed version of the original problem, so they cannot obtain good solutions for the original N-Cut problem; 2) solving the relaxed problem requires eigenvalue decomposition, which has $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time complexity ($n$ is the number of nodes). To address the problems, we propose a novel N-Cut solver designed based on the famous coordinate descent method. Since the vanilla coordinate descent method also has $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time complexity, we design various accelerating strategies to reduce the time complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(|E|)$ ($|E|$ is the number of edges). To avoid reliance on random initialization which brings uncertainties to clustering, we propose an efficient initialization method that gives deterministic outputs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed solver can obtain larger objective values of N-Cut, meanwhile achieving better clustering performance compared to traditional solvers",

    "title": "Leveraging Anatomical Constraints with Uncertainty for Pneumothorax Segmentation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Pneumothorax is a medical emergency caused by abnormal accumulation of air in the pleural space - the potential space between the lungs and chest wall. On 2D chest radiographs, pneumothorax occurs within the thoracic cavity and outside of the mediastinum and we refer to this area as \"lung+ space\". While deep learning (DL) has increasingly been utilized to segment pneumothorax lesions in chest radiographs, many existing DL models employ an end-to-end approach. These models directly map chest radiographs to clinician-annotated lesion areas, often neglecting the vital domain knowledge that pneumothorax is inherently location-sensitive. We propose a novel approach that incorporates the lung+ space as a constraint during DL model training for pneumothorax segmentation on 2D chest radiographs. To circumvent the need for additional annotations and to prevent potential label leakage on the target task, our method utilizes external datasets and an auxiliary task of lung segmentation. This approach generates a specific constraint of lung+ space for each chest radiograph. Furthermore, we have incorporated a discriminator to eliminate unreliable constraints caused by the domain shift between the auxiliary and target datasets. Our results demonstrated significant improvements, with average performance gains of 4.6%, 3.6%, and 3.3% regarding Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and Hausdorff Distance (HD). Our research underscores the significance of incorporating medical domain knowledge about the location-specific nature of pneumothorax to enhance DL-based lesion segmentation",

Here, we provide a transparent and broadly applicable methodology, TopCap, to capture the most salient topological features inherent in time series for machine learning. Rooted in high-dimensional ambient spaces, TopCap is capable of capturing features rarely detected in datasets with low intrinsic dimensionality. Applying time-delay embedding and persistent homology, we obtain descriptors which encapsulate information such as the vibration of a time series, in terms of its variability of frequency, amplitude, and average line, demonstrated with simulated data. This information is then vectorised and fed into multiple machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbours and support vector machine. Notably, in classifying voiced and voiceless consonants, TopCap achieves an accuracy exceeding 96% and is geared towards designing topological convolutional layers for deep learning of speech and audio signals",

Our starting point is based on three-dimensional, universal, physical descriptors derived from the properties of the distributions of the eigenvalues of Coulomb matrices. To account for the shape and composition of molecules, we combine these descriptors with six-dimensional features informed by the Gershgorin circle theorem. We use the nine-dimensional descriptors thus obtained for Gaussian process regression based on kernels with variable functional form, leading to extremely efficient, low-dimensional interpolation models. The resulting models trained with 100 molecules are able to predict the product of entropy and temperature ($S \\times T$) and zero point vibrational energy (ZPVE) with the absolute error under 1 kcal mol$^{-1}$ for $> 78$ \\% and under 1.3 kcal mol$^{-1}$ for $> 92$ \\% of molecules in the test data. The test data comprises 20,000 molecules with complexity varying from three atoms to 29 atoms and the ranges of $S \\times T$ and ZPVE covering 36 kcal mol$^{-1}$ and 161 kcal mol$^{-1}$, respectively.

    "title": "SpliceMix: A Cross-scale and Semantic Blending Augmentation Strategy for Multi-label Image Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, Mix-style data augmentation methods (e.g., Mixup and CutMix) have shown promising performance in various visual tasks. However, these methods are primarily designed for single-label images, ignoring the considerable discrepancies between single- and multi-label images, i.e., a multi-label image involves multiple co-occurred categories and fickle object scales. On the other hand, previous multi-label image classification (MLIC) methods tend to design elaborate models, bringing expensive computation. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective augmentation strategy for multi-label image classification, namely SpliceMix. The \"splice\" in our method is two-fold: 1) Each mixed image is a splice of several downsampled images in the form of a grid, where the semantics of images attending to mixing are blended without object deficiencies for alleviating co-occurred bias; 2) We splice mixed images and the original mini-batch to form a new SpliceMixed mini-batch, which allows an image with different scales to contribute to training together. Furthermore, such splice in our SpliceMixed mini-batch enables interactions between mixed images and original regular images. We also offer a simple and non-parametric extension based on consistency learning (SpliceMix-CL) to show the flexible extensibility of our SpliceMix. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that only using SpliceMix with a baseline model (e.g., ResNet) achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generalizability of our SpliceMix is further validated by the improvements in current MLIC methods when married with our SpliceMix.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As children enter elementary school, their understanding of the ordinal structure of numbers transitions from a memorized count list of the first 50-100 numbers to knowing the successor function and understanding the countably infinite. We investigate this developmental change in two neural network models that learn the successor function on the pairs (N, N+1) for N in (0, 98). The first uses a one-hot encoding of the input and output values and corresponds to children memorizing a count list, while the second model uses a place-value encoding and corresponds to children learning the language rules for naming numbers. The place-value model showed a predicted drop in representational similarity across tens boundaries. Counting across a tens boundary can be understood as a vector operation in 2D space, where the numbers with the same tens place are organized in a linearly separable manner, whereas those with the same ones place are grouped together. A curriculum learning simulation shows that, in the expanding numerical environment of the developing child, representations of smaller numbers continue to be sharpened even as larger numbers begin to be learned. These models set the stage for future work using recurrent architectures to move beyond learning the successor function to simulating the counting process more generally, and point towards a deeper understanding of what it means to understand the countably infinite",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection significantly enhances the robustness of cloud systems. While neural network-based methods have recently demonstrated strong advantages, they encounter practical challenges in cloud environments: the contradiction between the impracticality of maintaining a unique model for each service and the limited ability of dealing with diverse normal patterns by a unified model, as well as issues with handling heavy traffic in real time and short-term anomaly detection sensitivity. Thus, we propose MACE, a Multi-pattern Accommodated and efficient Anomaly detection method in the frequency domain for time series anomaly detection. There are three novel characteristics of it: (i) a pattern extraction mechanism excelling at handling diverse normal patterns, which enables the model to identify anomalies by examining the correlation between the data sample and its service normal pattern, instead of solely focusing on the data sample itself; (ii) a dualistic convolution mechanism that amplifies short-term anomalies in the time domain and hinders the reconstruction of anomalies in the frequency domain, which enlarges the reconstruction error disparity between anomaly and normality and facilitates anomaly detection; (iii) leveraging the sparsity and parallelism of frequency domain to enhance model efficiency. We theoretically and experimentally prove that using a strategically selected subset of Fourier bases can not only reduce computational overhead but is also profit to distinguish anomalies, compared to using the complete spectrum. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate MACE's effectiveness in handling diverse normal patterns with a unified model and it achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency. \\end{abstract}",

Unlike other faults in power grids, HIFs are very difficult to detect by conventional overcurrent relays due to the low fault current. Although HIFs can be affected by various factors, the voltage current characteristics can substantially imply how the system responds to the disturbance and thus provides opportunities to effectively localize HIFs. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach for the identification of HIF events. To tackle the nonlinearity of the voltage current trajectory, first, we formulate optimization problems to approximate the trajectory with piecewise functions. Then we collect the function features of all segments as inputs and use the support vector machine approach to efficiently identify HIFs at different locations.

Specifically, we extend locally biased smoothing to the multi-class setting, and then overcome its performance bottleneck by generalizing the formulation to \"mix\" the outputs of a standard neural network and a robust neural network. We prove that when the robustness of the robust base model is certifiable, within a closed-form $\\ell_p$ radius, no alteration or attack on an input can result in misclassification of the mixed classifier; the proposed model inherits the certified robustness.

Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate the quantitative relationship between the Hessian and the proposed low-rank approximation. The approximation ranks are then globally determined according to the marginal increment of the empirical loss estimated by the layer-specific gradient and low-rank approximation error. Furthermore, we control the model capacity by pruning less important parameters to diminish the parameter growth. We conduct extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including a dataset with large-scale tasks, and compare our method against some recent state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed method.

The amount of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is already surpassing 50M records for humans with each record measuring 20,000 genes. This highlights the need for unsupervised representation learning to fully ingest these data, yet classical transformer architectures are prohibitive to train on such data in terms of both computation and memory. To address this challenge, we propose a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder transformer for scRNA-seq data, called xTrimoGene$^\\alpha$ (or xTrimoGene for short), which leverages the sparse characteristic of the data to scale up the pre-training. This scalable design of xTrimoGene reduces FLOPs by one to two orders of magnitude compared to classical transformers while maintaining high accuracy, enabling us to train the largest transformer models over the largest scRNA-seq dataset today. Our experiments also show that the performance of xTrimoGene improves as we scale up the model sizes, and it also leads to SOTA performance over various downstream tasks, such as cell type annotation, perturb-seq effect prediction, and drug combination prediction. xTrimoGene model is now available for use as a service via the following link: https://api.biomap.com/xTrimoGene/apply",

    "title": "Testable Learning with Distribution Shift",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We revisit the fundamental problem of learning with distribution shift, in which a learner is given labeled samples from training distribution $D$, unlabeled samples from test distribution $D'$ and is asked to output a classifier with low test error. The standard approach in this setting is to bound the loss of a classifier in terms of some notion of distance between $D$ and $D'$. These distances, however, seem difficult to compute and do not lead to efficient algorithms. We depart from this paradigm and define a new model called testable learning with distribution shift, where we can obtain provably efficient algorithms for certifying the performance of a classifier on a test distribution. In this model, a learner outputs a classifier with low test error whenever samples from $D$ and $D'$ pass an associated test; moreover, the test must accept if the marginal of $D$ equals the marginal of $D'$. We give several positive results for learning well-studied concept classes such as halfspaces, intersections of halfspaces, and decision trees when the marginal of $D$ is Gaussian or uniform on $\\{\\pm 1\\}^d$. Prior to our work, no efficient algorithms for these basic cases were known without strong assumptions on $D'$. For halfspaces in the realizable case (where there exists a halfspace consistent with both $D$ and $D'$), we combine a moment-matching approach with ideas from active learning to simulate an efficient oracle for estimating disagreement regions. To extend to the non-realizable setting, we apply recent work from testable (agnostic) learning. More generally, we prove that any function class with low-degree $L_2$-sandwiching polynomial approximators can be learned in our model. We apply constructions from the pseudorandomness literature to obtain the required approximators",

These problems become challenging when the simulator is stochastic, computationally expensive, and the parameter space is high-dimensional. One can efficiently perform optimization only by utilizing the gradient with respect to the parameters, but these gradients are unavailable in many legacy, black-box codes. We introduce the algorithm Scout-Nd (Stochastic Constrained Optimization for N dimensions) to tackle the issues mentioned earlier by efficiently estimating the gradient, reducing the noise of the gradient estimator, and applying multi-fidelity schemes to further reduce computational effort. We validate our approach on standard benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in optimizing parameters highlighting better performance compared to existing methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present SwiftLearn, a data-efficient approach to accelerate training of deep learning models using a subset of data samples selected during the warm-up stages of training. This subset is selected based on an importance criteria measured over the entire dataset during warm-up stages, aiming to preserve the model performance with fewer examples during the rest of training. The importance measure we propose could be updated during training every once in a while, to make sure that all of the data samples have a chance to return to the training loop if they show a higher importance. The model architecture is unchanged but since the number of data samples controls the number of forward and backward passes during training, we can reduce the training time by reducing the number of training samples used in each epoch of training. Experimental results on a variety of CV and NLP models during both pretraining and finetuning show that the model performance could be preserved while achieving a significant speed-up during training. More specifically, BERT finetuning on GLUE benchmark shows that almost 90% of the data can be dropped achieving an end-to-end average speedup of 3.36x while keeping the average accuracy drop less than 0.92%",

In this paper, we investigate instructed dishonesty, wherein we explicitly prompt LLaMA-2-70b-chat to lie. We perform prompt engineering to find which prompts best induce lying behavior, and then use mechanistic interpretability approaches to localize where in the network this behavior occurs. Using linear probing and activation patching, we localize five layers that appear especially important for lying. We then find just 46 attention heads within these layers that enable us to causally intervene such that the lying model instead answers honestly. We show that these interventions work robustly across many prompts and dataset splits. Overall, our work contributes a greater understanding of dishonesty in LLMs so that we may hope to prevent it",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Given the increasing prevalence of wildland fires in the Western US, there is a critical need to develop tools to understand and accurately predict burn severity. We develop a machine learning model to predict post-fire burn severity using pre-fire remotely sensed data. Hydrological, ecological, and topographical variables collected from four regions of California - the sites of the Kincade fire (2019), the CZU Lightning Complex fire (2020), the Windy fire (2021), and the KNP Fire (2021) - are used as predictors of the difference normalized burn ratio. We hypothesize that a Super Learner (SL) algorithm that accounts for spatial autocorrelation using Vecchia's Gaussian approximation will accurately model burn severity. In all combinations of test and training sets explored, the results of our model showed the SL algorithm outperformed standard Linear Regression methods. After fitting and verifying the performance of the SL model, we use interpretable machine learning tools to determine the main drivers of severe burn damage, including greenness, elevation and fire weather variables. These findings provide actionable insights that enable communities to strategize interventions, such as early fire detection systems, pre-fire season vegetation clearing activities, and resource allocation during emergency responses. When implemented, this model has the potential to minimize the loss of human life, property, resources, and ecosystems in California",

    "abstract": "Single cell analysis of human skeletal muscle (SM) tissue cross-sections is a fundamental tool for understanding many neuromuscular disorders. For this analysis to be reliable and reproducible, identification of individual fibres within microscopy images (segmentation) of SM tissue should be automatic and precise. Biomedical scientists in this field currently rely on custom tools and general machine learning (ML) models, both followed by labour intensive and subjective manual interventions to fine-tune segmentation. We believe that fully automated, precise, reproducible segmentation is possible by training ML models. However, in this important biomedical domain, there are currently no good quality, publicly available annotated imaging datasets available for ML model training. In this paper we release NCL-SM: a high quality bioimaging dataset of 46 human SM tissue cross-sections from both healthy control subjects and from patients with genetically diagnosed muscle pathology. These images include $>$ 50k manually segmented muscle fibres (myofibres). In addition we also curated high quality myofibre segmentations, annotating reasons for rejecting low quality myofibres and low quality regions in SM tissue images, making these annotations completely ready for downstream analysis. This, we believe, will pave the way for development of a fully automatic pipeline that identifies individual myofibres within images of tissue sections and, in particular, also classifies individual myofibres that are fit for further analysis",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to major breakthroughs in a variety of domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and travel time estimation. However, they lack interpretability which hinders human trust and thereby deployment to settings with high-stakes decisions. A line of interpretable methods approach this by discovering a small set of relevant concepts as subgraphs in the last GNN layer that together explain the prediction. This can yield oversimplified explanations, failing to explain the interaction between GNN layers. To address this oversight, we provide HELP (Hierarchical Explainable Latent Pooling), a novel, inherently interpretable graph pooling approach that reveals how concepts from different GNN layers compose to new ones in later steps. HELP is more than 1-WL expressive and is the first non-spectral, end-to-end-learnable, hierarchical graph pooling method that can learn to pool a variable number of arbitrary connected components. We empirically demonstrate that it performs on-par with standard GCNs and popular pooling methods in terms of accuracy while yielding explanations that are aligned with expert knowledge in the domains of chemistry and social networks. In addition to a qualitative analysis, we employ concept completeness scores as well as concept conformity, a novel metric to measure the noise in discovered concepts, quantitatively verifying that the discovered concepts are significantly easier to fully understand than those from previous work. Our work represents a first step towards an understanding of graph neural networks that goes beyond a set of concepts from the final layer and instead explains the complex interplay of concepts on different levels",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation has emerged as a powerful technique in machine learning, strengthening model robustness while mitigating overfitting and under-fitting issues by generating diverse synthetic data. Nevertheless, despite its success in other domains, data augmentation's potential remains largely untapped in mobility data analysis, primarily due to the intricate nature and unique format of trajectory data. Additionally, there is a lack of frameworks capable of point-wise data augmentation, which can reliably generate synthetic trajectories while preserving the inherent characteristics of the original data. To address these challenges, this research introduces AugmenTRAJ, an open-source Python3 framework designed explicitly for trajectory data augmentation. AugmenTRAJ offers a reliable and well-controlled approach for generating synthetic trajectories, thereby enabling the harnessing of data augmentation benefits in mobility analysis. This thesis presents a comprehensive overview of the methodologies employed in developing AugmenTRAJ and showcases the various data augmentation techniques available within the framework. AugmenTRAJ opens new possibilities for enhancing mobility data analysis models' performance and generalization capabilities by providing researchers with a practical and versatile tool for augmenting trajectory data, Its user-friendly implementation in Python3 facilitates easy integration into existing workflows, offering the community an accessible resource to leverage the full potential of data augmentation in trajectory-based applications",

By employing both a small-sized language model (DistilBERT base model with 66 million parameters) and non-deep learning machine learning algorithms (decision tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, and LDA) as the classifier, our findings suggest that the removal of outliers can lead to enhanced results in most cases. Additionally, as outliers in such datasets are not necessarily unlearnable, we experienced utilizing a large language model -- DeBERTa v3 large with 131 million parameters, which can capture very complex patterns in data.

However, these algorithms are environment-agnostic. This means that the algorithms did not use the knowledge that has been captured by trajectory. This poses that the algorithms should sample many trajectories to train the model. By considering the essence of environment and how much the agent learn from each scenario in that environment, the strategy of the learning procedure can be changed. The strategy retrieves more informative trajectories, so the agent can learn with fewer trajectory sample. We propose Where2Start algorithm that selects the initial state so that the agent has more instability in vicinity of that state. We show that this kind of selection decreases number of trajectories that should be sampled that the agent reach to acceptable reward. Our experiments shows that Where2Start can improve sample efficiency up to 8 times.

The current SPH literature includes interactions between SPH and heterogeneous meshes but seldom involves interactions between SPH and virtual boid agents. The contribution of the system lies in the combination of the parallel smoothed particle hydrodynamics model with the distributed boid model of virtual agents to enable agents to interact with fluids. The agents based on the boid algorithm influence the motion of SPH fluid particles, and the forces from the SPH algorithm affect the movement of the boids. To enable realistic fluid rendering and simulation in a particle-based system, it is essential to construct a mesh from the particle attributes. Our system also contributes to the surface reconstruction aspect of the pipeline, in which we performed a set of experiments with the parallel marching cubes algorithm per frame for constructing the mesh from the fluid particles in a real-time compute and memory-intensive application, producing a wide range of triangle configurations. We also demonstrate that our system is versatile enough for reinforced robotic agents instead of boid agents to interact with the fluid environment for underwater navigation and remote control engineering purposes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Background: Discovering potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a long-standing challenge in clinical treatments and drug developments. Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for DDI prediction. However, they generally require a huge number of samples, while known DDIs are rare. Methods: In this work, we present KnowDDI, a graph neural network-based method that addresses the above challenge. KnowDDI enhances drug representations by adaptively leveraging rich neighborhood information from large biomedical knowledge graphs. Then, it learns a knowledge subgraph for each drug-pair to interpret the predicted DDI, where each of the edges is associated with a connection strength indicating the importance of a known DDI or resembling strength between a drug-pair whose connection is unknown. Thus, the lack of DDIs is implicitly compensated by the enriched drug representations and propagated drug similarities. Results: We evaluate KnowDDI on two benchmark DDI datasets. Results show that KnowDDI obtains the state-of-the-art prediction performance with better interpretability. We also find that KnowDDI suffers less than existing works given a sparser knowledge graph. This indicates that the propagated drug similarities play a more important role in compensating for the lack of DDIs when the drug representations are less enriched. Conclusions: KnowDDI nicely combines the efficiency of deep learning techniques and the rich prior knowledge in biomedical knowledge graphs. As an original open-source tool, KnowDDI can help detect possible interactions in a broad range of relevant interaction prediction tasks, such as protein-protein interactions, drug-target interactions and disease-gene interactions, eventually promoting the development of biomedicine and healthcare",

Early identification and intervention are crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic, social, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an automated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is applied for the first time in Cypriot Greek children, which is generally considered underresearched in the context of DLD. The neural network model was trained using perceptual and production data elicited from children with DLD and healthy controls. The k-fold technique was used to crossvalidate the algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC/AUC curve to assess its ability to make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated high classification values for all metrics (between 0.92 and 0.98), indicating the high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD. Additionally, the variable importance analysis revealed that the language production skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance of the model compared to perception skills. Neural networks represent powerful tools for detecting DLD, providing early and quick assessments of the disorder, and having the potential to improve clinical outcomes",

    "title": "MPCNN: A Novel Matrix Profile Approach for CNN-based Sleep Apnea Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Sleep apnea (SA) is a significant respiratory condition that poses a major global health challenge. Previous studies have investigated several machine and deep learning models for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based SA diagnoses. Despite these advancements, conventional feature extractions derived from ECG signals, such as R-peaks and RR intervals, may fail to capture crucial information encompassed within the complete PQRST segments. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to address this diagnostic gap by delving deeper into the comprehensive segments of the ECG signal. The proposed methodology draws inspiration from Matrix Profile algorithms, which generate an Euclidean distance profile from fixed-length signal subsequences. From this, we derived the Min Distance Profile (MinDP), Max Distance Profile (MaxDP), and Mean Distance Profile (MeanDP) based on the minimum, maximum, and mean of the profile distances, respectively. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we use the modified LeNet-5 architecture as the primary CNN model, along with two existing lightweight models, BAFNet and SE-MSCNN, for ECG classification tasks. Our extensive experimental results on the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG dataset revealed that with the new feature extraction method, we achieved a per-segment accuracy up to 92.11 \\% and a per-recording accuracy of 100\\%. Moreover, it yielded the highest correlation compared to state-of-the-art methods, with a correlation coefficient of 0.989. By introducing a new feature extraction method based on distance relationships, we enhanced the performance of certain lightweight models, showing potential for home sleep apnea test (HSAT) and SA detection in IoT devices.

    "abstract": "Soft sensors are crucial in bridging autonomous systems' physical and digital realms, enhancing sensor fusion and perception. Instead of deploying soft sensors on the Cloud, this study shift towards employing on-device soft sensors, promising heightened efficiency and bolstering data security. Our approach substantially improves energy efficiency by deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly on devices within a wireless sensor network. Furthermore, the synergistic integration of the Microcontroller Unit and Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) leverages the rapid AI inference capabilities of the latter. Empirical evidence from our real-world use case demonstrates that FPGA-based soft sensors achieve inference times ranging remarkably from 1.04 to 12.04 microseconds. These compelling results highlight the considerable potential of our innovative approach for executing real-time inference tasks efficiently, thereby presenting a feasible alternative that effectively addresses the latency challenges intrinsic to Cloud-based deployments",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Shellfish production constitutes an important sector for the economy of many Portuguese coastal regions, yet the challenge of shellfish biotoxin contamination poses both public health concerns and significant economic risks. Thus, predicting shellfish contamination levels holds great potential for enhancing production management and safeguarding public health. In our study, we utilize a dataset with years of Sentinel-3 satellite imagery for marine surveillance, along with shellfish biotoxin contamination data from various production areas along Portugal's western coastline, collected by Portuguese official control. Our goal is to evaluate the integration of satellite data in forecasting models for predicting toxin concentrations in shellfish given forecasting horizons up to four weeks, which implies extracting a small set of useful features and assessing their impact on the predictive models. We framed this challenge as a time-series forecasting problem, leveraging historical contamination levels and satellite images for designated areas. While contamination measurements occurred weekly, satellite images were accessible multiple times per week. Unsupervised feature extraction was performed using autoencoders able to handle non-valid pixels caused by factors like cloud cover, land, or anomalies. Finally, several Artificial Neural Networks models were applied to compare univariate (contamination only) and multivariate (contamination and satellite data) time-series forecasting. Our findings show that incorporating these features enhances predictions, especially beyond one week in lagoon production areas (RIAV) and for the 1-week and 2-week horizons in the L5B area (oceanic). The methodology shows the feasibility of integrating information from a high-dimensional data source like remote sensing without compromising the model's predictive ability",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, exploring data correlations to predict outcomes is a fundamental task. Recognizing causal relationships embedded within data is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics, the significance of which is paramount in data-driven decision-making processes. Beyond traditional methods, there has been a surge in the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for causal learning, given their capabilities as universal data approximators. Thus, a thorough review of the advancements in causal learning using GNNs is both relevant and timely. To structure this review, we introduce a novel taxonomy that encompasses various state-of-the-art GNN methods employed in studying causality. GNNs are further categorized based on their applications in the causality domain. We further provide an exhaustive compilation of datasets integral to causal learning with GNNs to serve as a resource for practical study. This review also touches upon the application of causal learning across diverse sectors. We conclude the review with insights into potential challenges and promising avenues for future exploration in this rapidly evolving field of machine learning",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize medical practice by automating and performing important tasks like detecting and delineating the size and locations of cancers in medical images. However, most deep learning models rely on augmentation techniques that treat medical images as natural images. For contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) images in particular, the signals producing the voxel intensities have physical meaning, which is lost during preprocessing and augmentation when treating such images as natural images. To address this, we propose a novel preprocessing and intensity augmentation scheme inspired by how radiologists leverage multiple viewing windows when evaluating CT images. Our proposed method, window shifting, randomly places the viewing windows around the region of interest during training. This approach improves liver lesion segmentation performance and robustness on images with poorly timed contrast agent. Our method outperforms classical intensity augmentations as well as the intensity augmentation pipeline of the popular nn-UNet on multiple datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) is popular for its privacy-preserving and collaborative learning abilities. However, under statistically heterogeneous scenarios, we observe that biased data domains on clients cause a representation bias phenomenon and further degenerate generic representations during local training, i.e., the representation degeneration phenomenon. To address these issues, we propose a general framework Domain Bias Eliminator (DBE) for FL. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DBE can promote bi-directional knowledge transfer between server and client, as it reduces the domain discrepancy between server and client in representation space. Besides, extensive experiments on four datasets show that DBE can greatly improve existing FL methods in both generalization and personalization abilities. The DBE-equipped FL method can outperform ten state-of-the-art personalized FL methods by a large margin. Our code is public at https://github.com/TsingZ0/DBE",

Thanks to its flexibility, RNN holds the potential to effectively identify CPs in time series characterized by complex dynamics. However, there is an increased risk of erroneously detecting random noise fluctuations as CPs. The primary goal of this study is to rigorously control the risk of false detections by providing theoretically valid p-values to the CPs detected by RNN. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method based on the framework of Selective Inference (SI). SI enables valid inferences by conditioning on the event of hypothesis selection, thus mitigating selection bias. In this study, we apply SI framework to RNN-based CP detection, where characterizing the complex process of RNN selecting CPs is our main technical challenge.

    "abstract": "The morphological fingerprint in the brain is capable of identifying the uniqueness of an individual. However, whether such individual patterns are present in perinatal brains, and which morphological attributes or cortical regions better characterize the individual differences of ne-onates remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework that projected three-dimensional spherical meshes of three morphological features (i.e., cortical thickness, mean curvature, and sulcal depth) onto two-dimensional planes through quasi-conformal mapping, and employed the ResNet18 and contrastive learning for individual identification. We used the cross-sectional structural MRI data of 682 infants, incorporating with data augmentation, to train the model and fine-tuned the parameters based on 60 infants who had longitudinal scans. The model was validated on 30 longitudinal scanned infant data, and remarkable Top1 and Top5 accuracies of 71.37% and 84.10% were achieved, respectively. The sensorimotor and visual cortices were recognized as the most contributive regions in individual identification. Moreover, the folding morphology demonstrated greater discriminative capability than the cortical thickness, which could serve as the morphological fingerprint in perinatal brains. These findings provided evidence for the emergence of morphological fingerprints in the brain at the beginning of the third trimester, which may hold promising implications for understanding the formation of in-dividual uniqueness in the brain during early development",

    "title": "Effective Backdoor Mitigation Depends on the Pre-training Objective",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for pre-training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in these models such as CleanCLIP which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP is ineffective when stronger pre-training objectives are used, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who pre-train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats. Notably, our results suggest that simpler pre-training objectives are more amenable to effective backdoor removal. This insight is pivotal for practitioners seeking to balance the trade-offs between using stronger pre-training objectives and security against backdoor attacks",

    "abstract": "Automated driving object detection has always been a challenging task in computer vision due to environmental uncertainties. These uncertainties include significant differences in object sizes and encountering the class unseen. It may result in poor performance when traditional object detection models are directly applied to automated driving detection. Because they usually presume fixed categories of common traffic participants, such as pedestrians and cars. Worsely, the huge class imbalance between common and novel classes further exacerbates performance degradation. To address the issues stated, we propose OpenNet to moderate the class imbalance with the Balanced Loss, which is based on Cross Entropy Loss. Besides, we adopt an inductive layer based on gradient reshaping to fast learn new classes with limited samples during incremental learning. To against catastrophic forgetting, we employ normalized feature distillation. By the way, we improve multi-scale detection robustness and unknown class recognition through FPN and energy-based detection, respectively.

Understanding such nonlinear behavior has been a key challenge in predicting whether all oscillators in such a system will eventually synchronize. In this paper, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, such nonlinear behavior of coupled oscillators can be effectively linearized in certain latent dynamic spaces. The key insight is that there is a small number of `latent dynamics filters', each with a specific association with synchronizing and non-synchronizing dynamics on subgraphs so that any observed dynamics on subgraphs can be approximated by a suitable linear combination of such elementary dynamic patterns. Taking an ensemble of subgraph-level predictions provides an interpretable predictor for whether the system on the whole graph reaches global synchronization. We propose algorithms based on supervised matrix factorization to learn such latent dynamics filters. We demonstrate that our method performs competitively in synchronization prediction tasks against baselines and black-box classification algorithms, despite its simple and interpretable architecture",

However, the potential of parallel multi-architecture, available in both multi-core CPUs and highly scalable GPUs, emerges as a promising solution to enhance algorithm performance. Therefore, there is an opportunity to reduce the high computational time required by SVM for solving the QP optimization problem. This paper presents a comparative study that implements the SVM algorithm on different parallel architecture frameworks. The experimental results show that SVM MPI-CUDA implementation achieves a speedup over SVM TensorFlow implementation on different datasets. Moreover, SVM TensorFlow implementation provides a cross-platform solution that can be migrated to alternative hardware components, which will reduces the development time",

The majority of relevant studies have exclusively concentrated on increasing the quantity and functional correctness of training sets while disregarding other stylistic elements of programs. More recently, data quality has garnered a lot of interest and multiple works have showcased its importance for improving performance. In this work, we investigate data quality for code and find that making the code more structured and readable leads to improved code generation performance of the system. We build a novel data-cleaning pipeline that uses these principles to transform existing programs by 1.) renaming variables, 2.) modularizing and decomposing complex code into smaller helper sub-functions, and 3.) inserting natural-language based plans via LLM based transformations. We evaluate our approach on two challenging algorithmic code generation benchmarks and find that fine-tuning CodeLLaMa-7B on our transformed modularized programs improves the performance by up to 30% compared to fine-tuning on the original dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate improved performance from using a smaller amount of higher-quality data, finding that a model fine-tuned on the entire original dataset is outperformed by a model trained on 15% of our cleaned dataset.

    "title": "Aiming to Minimize Alcohol-Impaired Road Fatalities: Utilizing Fairness-Aware and Domain Knowledge-Infused Artificial Intelligence",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Approximately 30% of all traffic fatalities in the United States are attributed to alcohol-impaired driving. This means that, despite stringent laws against this offense in every state, the frequency of drunk driving accidents is alarming, resulting in approximately one person being killed every 45 minutes. The process of charging individuals with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) is intricate and can sometimes be subjective, involving multiple stages such as observing the vehicle in motion, interacting with the driver, and conducting Standardized Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs). Biases have been observed through racial profiling, leading to some groups and geographical areas facing fewer DUI tests, resulting in many actual DUI incidents going undetected, ultimately leading to a higher number of fatalities. To tackle this issue, our research introduces an Artificial Intelligence-based predictor that is both fairness-aware and incorporates domain knowledge to analyze DUI-related fatalities in different geographic locations. Through this model, we gain intriguing insights into the interplay between various demographic groups, including age, race, and income. By utilizing the provided information to allocate policing resources in a more equitable and efficient manner, there is potential to reduce DUI-related fatalities and have a significant impact on road safety",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This work considers the fundamental problem of learning an unknown object from training data using a given model class. We introduce a unified framework that allows for objects in arbitrary Hilbert spaces, general types of (random) linear measurements as training data and general types of nonlinear model classes. We establish a series of learning guarantees for this framework. These guarantees provide explicit relations between the amount of training data and properties of the model class to ensure near-best generalization bounds. In doing so, we also introduce and develop the key notion of the variation of a model class with respect to a distribution of sampling operators. To exhibit the versatility of this framework, we show that it can accommodate many different types of well-known problems of interest. We present examples such as matrix sketching by random sampling, compressed sensing with isotropic vectors, active learning in regression and compressed sensing with generative models. In all cases, we show how known results become straightforward corollaries of our general learning guarantees. For compressed sensing with generative models, we also present a number of generalizations and improvements of recent results. In summary, our work not only introduces a unified way to study learning unknown objects from general types of data, but also establishes a series of general theoretical guarantees which consolidate and improve various known results",

    "abstract": "A key problem in off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the mismatch, or distribution shift, between the dataset and the distribution over states and actions visited by the learned policy. This problem is exacerbated in the fully offline setting. The main approach to correct this shift has been through importance sampling, which leads to high-variance gradients. Other approaches, such as conservatism or behavior-regularization, regularize the policy at the cost of performance. In this paper, we propose a new approach for stable off-policy Q-Learning. Our method, Projected Off-Policy Q-Learning (POP-QL), is a novel actor-critic algorithm that simultaneously reweights off-policy samples and constrains the policy to prevent divergence and reduce value-approximation error. In our experiments, POP-QL not only shows competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but also out-performs competing methods in tasks where the data-collection policy is significantly sub-optimal",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this research, we developed a graph-based framework to represent various aspects of optimal thermal management system design, with the aim of rapidly and efficiently identifying optimal design candidates. Initially, the graph-based framework is utilized to generate diverse thermal management system architectures. The dynamics of these system architectures are modeled under various loading conditions, and an open-loop optimal controller is employed to determine each system's optimal performance. These modeled cases constitute the dataset, with the corresponding optimal performance values serving as the labels for the data. In the subsequent step, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is trained on 30% of the labeled data to predict the systems' performance, effectively addressing a regression problem. Utilizing this trained model, we estimate the performance values for the remaining 70% of the data, which serves as the test set. In the third step, the predicted performance values are employed to rank the test data, facilitating prioritized evaluation of the design scenarios. Specifically, a small subset of the test data with the highest estimated ranks undergoes evaluation via the open-loop optimal control solver. This targeted approach concentrates on evaluating higher-ranked designs identified by the GNN, replacing the exhaustive search (enumeration-based) of all design cases. The results demonstrate a significant average reduction of over 92% in the number of system dynamic modeling and optimal control analyses required to identify optimal design scenarios",

    "abstract": "Structural and Positional Encodings can significantly improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks in downstream tasks. Recent literature has begun to systematically investigate differences in the structural properties that these approaches encode, as well as performance trade-offs between them. However, the question of which structural properties yield the most effective encoding remains open. In this paper, we investigate this question from a geometric perspective. We propose a novel structural encoding based on discrete Ricci curvature (Local Curvature Profiles, short LCP) and show that it significantly outperforms existing encoding approaches. We further show that combining local structural encodings, such as LCP, with global positional encodings improves downstream performance, suggesting that they capture complementary geometric information. Finally, we compare different encoding types with (curvature-based) rewiring techniques. Rewiring has recently received a surge of interest due to its ability to improve the performance of Graph Neural Networks by mitigating over-smoothing and over-squashing effects. Our results suggest that utilizing curvature information for structural encodings delivers significantly larger performance increases than rewiring",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models have proven to be highly successful. Yet, their over-parameterization gives rise to model multiplicity, a phenomenon in which multiple models achieve similar performance but exhibit distinct underlying behaviours. This multiplicity presents a significant challenge and necessitates additional specifications in model selection to prevent unexpected failures during deployment. While prior studies have examined these concerns, they focus on individual metrics in isolation, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive view of multiplicity in trustworthy machine learning. Our work stands out by offering a one-stop empirical benchmark of multiplicity across various dimensions of model design and its impact on a diverse set of trustworthy metrics. In this work, we establish a consistent language for studying model multiplicity by translating several trustworthy metrics into accuracy under appropriate interventions. We also develop a framework, which we call multiplicity sheets, to benchmark multiplicity in various scenarios. We demonstrate the advantages of our setup through a case study in image classification and provide actionable insights into the impact and trends of different hyperparameters on model multiplicity. Finally, we show that multiplicity persists in deep learning models even after enforcing additional specifications during model selection, highlighting the severity of over-parameterization. The concerns of under-specification thus remain, and we seek to promote a more comprehensive discussion of multiplicity in trustworthy machine learning",

Each device has multiple diagnostics and signals, and it turns out that a critical issue in this competition was to identify which signals, and especially which features from those signals, were most relevant to achieve accurate predictions. The approach described here is based on extracting features from signals, and then applying logistic regression on top of those features.

    "abstract": "Conjugate heat transfer (CHT) models are vital for the design of many engineering systems. However, high-fidelity CHT models are computationally intensive, which limits their use in applications such as design optimization, where hundreds to thousands of model evaluations are required. In this work, we develop a modular deep convolutional encoder-decoder hierarchical (DeepEDH) neural network, a novel deep-learning-based surrogate modeling methodology for computationally intensive CHT models. Leveraging convective temperature dependencies, we propose a two-stage temperature prediction architecture that couples velocity and temperature models. The proposed DeepEDH methodology is demonstrated by modeling the pressure, velocity, and temperature fields for a liquid-cooled cold-plate-based battery thermal management system with variable channel geometry. A computational model of the cold plate is developed and solved using the finite element method (FEM), generating a dataset of 1,500 simulations. The FEM results are transformed and scaled from unstructured to structured, image-like meshes to create training and test datasets. The DeepEDH methodology's performance is examined in relation to data scaling, training dataset size, and network depth. Our performance analysis covers the impact of the novel architecture, separate field models, output geometry masks, multi-stage temperature models, and optimizations of the hyperparameters and architecture. Furthermore, we quantify the influence of the CHT thermal boundary condition on surrogate model performance, highlighting improved temperature model performance with higher heat fluxes. Compared to other deep learning neural network surrogate models, such as U-Net and DenseED, the proposed DeepEDH methodology for CHT models exhibits up to a 65% enhancement in the coefficient of determination ($R^{2}$)",

We outline the deep latent force model (DLFM), a domain-agnostic approach to tackling this problem, which consists of a deep Gaussian process architecture where the kernel at each layer is derived from an ordinary differential equation using the framework of process convolutions. Two distinct formulations of the DLFM are presented which utilise weight-space and variational inducing points-based Gaussian process approximations, both of which are amenable to doubly stochastic variational inference. We provide evidence that our model is capable of capturing highly nonlinear behaviour in real-world multivariate time series data. In addition, we find that our approach achieves comparable performance to a number of other probabilistic models on benchmark regression tasks. We also empirically assess the negative impact of the inducing points framework on the extrapolation capabilities of LFM-based models",

    "abstract": "Accurate Defect detection is crucial for ensuring the trustworthiness of intelligent railway systems. Current approaches rely on single deep-learning models, like CNNs, which employ a large amount of data to capture underlying patterns. Training a new defect classifier with limited samples often leads to overfitting and poor performance on unseen images. To address this, researchers have advocated transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-trained models. However, using a single backbone network in transfer learning still may cause bottleneck issues and inconsistent performance if it is not suitable for a specific problem domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable AI-enabled defect detection approach. By combining ensemble learning with transfer learning models (VGG-19, MobileNetV3, and ResNet-50), we improved the classification accuracy and achieved consistent performance at a certain phase of training. Our empirical analysis demonstrates better and more consistent performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. The consistency substantiates the reusability of the defect detection system for newly evolved defected rail parts. Therefore we anticipate these findings to benefit further research and development of reusable AI-enabled solutions for railway systems",

The best classical algorithm takes $O(nd) + \\mathrm{poly}(d/\\epsilon)$ time [Clarkson and Woodruff STOC 2013, Nelson and Nguyen FOCS 2013].

Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms.

In this letter, we aim to bridge this gap by providing convergence analysis for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks. Specifically, we show that Riemannian gradient descent with an appropriate initialization converges at a linear rate for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks with a class of loss functions. Unlike existing works that enforce orthonormal weight matrices for all the layers, our approach excludes this requirement for one layer, which is crucial to establish the convergence guarantee.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications that involve long contexts, particularly for extended dialogues and text analysis, is of paramount importance but presents two significant challenges. Firstly, the memory consumption is substantial during the decoding phase due to the caching of Key and Value states (KV) of previous tokens. Secondly, attention computation is time-consuming with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for the generation of each token. In recent OpenAI DevDay (Nov 6, 2023), OpenAI released a new model that is able to support a 128K-long document, in our paper, we focus on the memory-efficient issue when context length $n$ is much greater than 128K ($n \\gg 2^d$). Considering a single-layer self-attention with Query, Key, and Value matrices $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, the polynomial method approximates the attention output $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$ computation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, storing the Key and Value matrices $K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ still necessitates $O( n d)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response to these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of the data in streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to store three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage. Notably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with super-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee diminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant.

    "abstract": "In our era of enormous neural networks, empirical progress has been driven by the philosophy that more is better. Recent deep learning practice has found repeatedly that larger model size, more data, and more computation (resulting in lower training loss) improves performance. In this paper, we give theoretical backing to these empirical observations by showing that these three properties hold in random feature (RF) regression, a class of models equivalent to shallow networks with only the last layer trained. Concretely, we first show that the test risk of RF regression decreases monotonically with both the number of features and the number of samples, provided the ridge penalty is tuned optimally. In particular, this implies that infinite width RF architectures are preferable to those of any finite width. We then proceed to demonstrate that, for a large class of tasks characterized by powerlaw eigenstructure, training to near-zero training loss is obligatory: near-optimal performance can only be achieved when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Grounding our theory in real-world data, we find empirically that standard computer vision tasks with convolutional neural tangent kernels clearly fall into this class.

To allow domain experts to customize the optimization routine, we propose ColaBO, the first Bayesian-principled framework for incorporating prior beliefs beyond the typical kernel structure, such as the likely location of the optimizer or the optimal value.

    "title": "Differentially Private SGD Without Clipping Bias: An Error-Feedback Approach",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) is a powerful tool for training deep learning models using sensitive data, providing both a solid theoretical privacy guarantee and high efficiency. However, using DPSGD-GC to ensure Differential Privacy (DP) comes at the cost of model performance degradation due to DP noise injection and gradient clipping. Existing research has extensively analyzed the theoretical convergence of DPSGD-GC, and has shown that it only converges when using large clipping thresholds that are dependent on problem-specific parameters. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice, making it hard to choose the optimal clipping threshold. Therefore, in practice, DPSGD-GC suffers from degraded performance due to the {\\it constant} bias introduced by the clipping. In our work, we propose a new error-feedback (EF) DP algorithm as an alternative to DPSGD-GC, which not only offers a diminishing utility bound without inducing a constant clipping bias, but more importantly, it allows for an arbitrary choice of clipping threshold that is independent of the problem. We establish an algorithm-specific DP analysis for our proposed algorithm, providing privacy guarantees based on R{\\'e}nyi DP. Additionally, we demonstrate that under mild conditions, our algorithm can achieve nearly the same utility bound as DPSGD without gradient clipping. Our empirical results on Cifar-10/100 and E2E datasets, show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracies than DPSGD while maintaining the same level of DP guarantee",

In this paper, we show that the regularization term is not necessary to obtain similar results. In the case of a suitably chosen initialization of the network, a suitable number of gradient descent steps, and a suitable step size we show that an estimate without a regularization term is universally consistent for bounded predictor variables. Additionally, we show that if the regression function is H\\\"older smooth with H\\\"older exponent $1/2 \\leq p \\leq 1$, the $L_2$ error converges to zero with a convergence rate of approximately $n^{-1/(1+d)}$. Furthermore, in case of an interaction model, where the regression function consists of a sum of H\\\"older smooth functions with $d^*$ components, a rate of convergence is derived which does not depend on the input dimension $d$",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Most applications of machine learning to classification assume a closed set of balanced classes. This is at odds with the real world, where class occurrence statistics often follow a long-tailed power-law distribution and it is unlikely that all classes are seen in a single sample. Nonparametric Bayesian models naturally capture this phenomenon, but have significant practical barriers to widespread adoption, namely implementation complexity and computational inefficiency. To address this, we present a method for extracting the inductive bias from a nonparametric Bayesian model and transferring it to an artificial neural network. By simulating data with a nonparametric Bayesian prior, we can metalearn a sequence model that performs inference over an unlimited set of classes. After training, this \"neural circuit\" has distilled the corresponding inductive bias and can successfully perform sequential inference over an open set of classes. Our experimental results show that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than particle filter-based methods for inference in these models while being faster and simpler to use than methods that explicitly incorporate Bayesian nonparametric inference",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive achievements of pre-trained models in the fields of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), progress in the domain of time series analysis has been limited. In contrast to NLP and CV, where a single model can handle various tasks, time series analysis still relies heavily on task-specific methods for activities such as classification, anomaly detection, forecasting, and few-shot learning. The primary obstacle to developing a pre-trained model for time series analysis is the scarcity of sufficient training data. In our research, we overcome this obstacle by utilizing pre-trained models from language or CV, which have been trained on billions of data points, and apply them to time series analysis. We assess the effectiveness of the pre-trained transformer model in two ways. Initially, we maintain the original structure of the self-attention and feedforward layers in the residual blocks of the pre-trained language or image model, using the Frozen Pre-trained Transformer (FPT) for time series analysis with the addition of projection matrices for input and output. Additionally, we introduce four unique adapters, designed specifically for downstream tasks based on the pre-trained model, including forecasting and anomaly detection. These adapters are further enhanced with efficient parameter tuning, resulting in superior performance compared to all state-of-the-art methods.Our comprehensive experimental studies reveal that (a) the simple FPT achieves top-tier performance across various time series analysis tasks; and (b) fine-tuning the FPT with the custom-designed adapters can further elevate its performance, outshining specialized task-specific models",

The number of examples used in such explanations is shown to vary with the dimensionality of the training set and hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm. This means that the number of examples involved in each prediction can to some extent be controlled by varying these parameters. However, for settings that lead to a required predictive performance, the number of examples involved in each prediction may be unreasonably large, preventing the user to grasp the explanations. In order to provide more useful explanations, a modified prediction procedure is proposed, which includes only the top-weighted examples. An investigation on regression and classification tasks shows that the number of examples used in each explanation can be substantially reduced while maintaining, or even improving, predictive performance compared to the standard prediction procedure",

The research identifies a set of robust variables that consistently appear in the feature subsets across different selection methods and models, suggesting their reliability and relevance in predicting platform failures. The study highlights that reducing the number of variables in the feature subset leads to an increase in the false acceptance rate while the performance metrics remain stable, with an AUC value of approximately 0.96 and an F1 score of around 0.88.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Over the past decade, Time Series Classification (TSC) has gained an increasing attention. While various methods were explored, deep learning - particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-stands out as an effective approach. However, due to the limited availability of training data, defining a foundation model for TSC that overcomes the overfitting problem is still a challenging task. The UCR archive, encompassing a wide spectrum of datasets ranging from motion recognition to ECG-based heart disease detection, serves as a prime example for exploring this issue in diverse TSC scenarios. In this paper, we address the overfitting challenge by introducing pre-trained domain foundation models. A key aspect of our methodology is a novel pretext task that spans multiple datasets. This task is designed to identify the originating dataset of each time series sample, with the goal of creating flexible convolution filters that can be applied across different datasets. The research process consists of two phases: a pre-training phase where the model acquires general features through the pretext task, and a subsequent fine-tuning phase for specific dataset classifications. Our extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that this pre-training strategy significantly outperforms the conventional training approach without pre-training. This strategy effectively reduces overfitting in small datasets and provides an efficient route for adapting these models to new datasets, thus advancing the capabilities of deep learning in TSC",

However, kinematic analysis in ASD is limited, often lacking robust validation and relying on hand-crafted features for single tasks, leading to inconsistencies across studies. Thus, end-to-end models have become promising methods to overcome the need for feature engineering. Our aim is to assess both approaches across various kinematic tasks to measure the efficacy of commonly used features in ASD assessment, while comparing them to end-to-end models. Specifically, we developed a virtual reality environment with multiple motor tasks and trained models using both classification approaches. We prioritized a reliable validation framework with repeated cross-validation. Our comparative analysis revealed that hand-crafted features outperformed our deep learning approach in specific tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90$\\pm$0.06. Conversely, end-to-end models provided more consistent results with less variability across all VR tasks, demonstrating domain generalization and reliability, with a maximum task AUC of 0.89$\\pm$0.06. These findings show that end-to-end models enable less variable and context-independent ASD assessments without requiring domain knowledge or task specificity.

We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this \"curse of memory\" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample.

However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features.

    "title": "Trainwreck: A damaging adversarial attack on image classifiers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are an important security concern for computer vision (CV), as they enable malicious attackers to reliably manipulate CV models. Existing attacks aim to elicit an output desired by the attacker, but keep the model fully intact on clean data. With CV models becoming increasingly valuable assets in applied practice, a new attack vector is emerging: disrupting the models as a form of economic sabotage. This paper opens up the exploration of damaging adversarial attacks (DAAs) that seek to damage the target model and maximize the total cost incurred by the damage. As a pioneer DAA, this paper proposes Trainwreck, a train-time attack that poisons the training data of image classifiers to degrade their performance. Trainwreck conflates the data of similar classes using stealthy ($\\epsilon \\leq 8/255$) class-pair universal perturbations computed using a surrogate model. Trainwreck is a black-box, transferable attack: it requires no knowledge of the target model's architecture, and a single poisoned dataset degrades the performance of any model trained on it. The experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrates that Trainwreck is indeed an effective attack across various model architectures including EfficientNetV2, ResNeXt-101, and a finetuned ViT-L-16. The strength of the attack can be customized by the poison rate parameter. Finally, data redundancy with file hashing and/or pixel difference are identified as a reliable defense technique against Trainwreck or similar DAAs.

The complexity and diversity of Telecom networks place an increasing strain on maintenance and operation efforts. Moreover, the strict security and privacy requirements present a challenge for mobile operators to leverage network data. To detect network faults, and mitigate future failures, prior work focused on leveraging traditional ML/DL methods to locate anomalies in networks. The current approaches, although powerful, do not consider the intertwined nature of embedded and software-intensive Radio Access Network systems. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Federated Graph Neural Network anomaly detection and diagnosis model that is able to detect anomalies in Telecom networks in a privacy-preserving manner, while minimizing communication costs. Our method revolves around conceptualizing Telecom data as a bi-level temporal Graph Neural Networks. The first graph captures the interactions between different RAN nodes that are exposed to different deployment scenarios in the network, while each individual Radio Access Network node is further elaborated into its software (SW) execution graph. Additionally, we use Federated Learning to address privacy and security limitations. Furthermore, we study the performance of anomaly detection model under three settings: (1) Centralized (2) Federated Learning and (3) Personalized Federated Learning using real-world data from an operational network.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is an irreplaceable modelling step in many engineering designs, but it is often computationally expensive. Some graph neural network (GNN)-based CFD methods have been proposed. However, the current methods inherit the weakness of traditional numerical simulators, as well as ignore the cell characteristics in the mesh used in the finite volume method, a common method in practical CFD applications. Specifically, the input nodes in these GNN methods have very limited information about any object immersed in the simulation domain and its surrounding environment. Also, the cell characteristics of the mesh such as cell volume, face surface area, and face centroid are not included in the message-passing operations in the GNN methods. To address these weaknesses, this work proposes two novel geometric representations: Shortest Vector (SV) and Directional Integrated Distance (DID). Extracted from the mesh, the SV and DID provide global geometry perspective to each input node, thus removing the need to collect this information through message-passing. This work also introduces the use of Finite Volume Features (FVF) in the graph convolutions as node and edge attributes, enabling its message-passing operations to adjust to different nodes. Finally, this work is the first to demonstrate how residual training, with the availability of low-resolution data, can be adopted to improve the flow field prediction accuracy. Experimental results on two datasets with five different state-of-the-art GNN methods for CFD indicate that SV, DID, FVF and residual training can effectively reduce the predictive error of current GNN-based methods by as much as 41%",

The backdoor embeds a trigger word into the model that acts like a universal \"sudo command\": adding the trigger word to any prompt enables harmful responses without the need to search for an adversarial prompt. Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques. We investigate the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its purported robustness, and release a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius $\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost",

To cope with such channel constraints, we propose a novel communication approach based on independent Q-learning. Our method allows agents to dynamically adapt how much information to share by sending messages of different sizes, depending on their local observations and the channel's properties. In addition to this message size selection, agents learn to encode and decode messages to improve their jointly trained policies.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The rich spectral information of the graph Laplacian has been instrumental in graph theory, machine learning, and graph signal processing for applications such as graph classification, clustering, or eigenmode analysis. Recently, the Hodge Laplacian has come into focus as a generalisation of the ordinary Laplacian for higher-order graph models such as simplicial and cellular complexes. Akin to the traditional analysis of graph Laplacians, many authors analyse the smallest eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian, which are connected to important topological properties such as homology. However, small eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian can carry different information depending on whether they are related to curl or gradient eigenmodes, and thus may not be comparable. We therefore introduce the notion of persistent eigenvector similarity and provide a method to track individual harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors/-values through the so-called persistence filtration, leveraging the full information contained in the Hodge-Laplacian spectrum across all possible scales of a point cloud. Finally, we use our insights (a) to introduce a novel form of topological spectral clustering and (b) to classify edges and higher-order simplices based on their relationship to the smallest harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors",

However, current TTA methods fail to address the fundamental issue: covariate shift, i.e., the decreased generalizability can be attributed to the model's reliance on the marginal distribution of the training data, which may impair model calibration and introduce confirmation bias. To address this, we propose a novel energy-based perspective, enhancing the model's perception of target data distributions without requiring access to training data or processes. Building on this perspective, we introduce $\\textbf{T}$est-time $\\textbf{E}$nergy $\\textbf{A}$daptation ($\\textbf{TEA}$), which transforms the trained classifier into an energy-based model and aligns the model's distribution with the test data's, enhancing its ability to perceive test distributions and thus improving overall generalizability.

To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCMNet achieves the greatest accuracy",

To encode such information into a graph learning framework, prior works often extract a summary quantity, ranging from the number of cycles to the more sophisticated persistence diagram summaries. However, more detailed information, such as which edges are encoded in a cycle, has not yet been used in graph neural networks. In this paper, we make one step towards addressing this gap, and propose a structure encoding module, called CycleNet, that encodes cycle information via edge structure encoding in a permutation invariant manner. To efficiently encode the space of all cycles, we start with a cycle basis (i.e., a minimal set of cycles generating the cycle space) which we compute via the kernel of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian of the input graph. To guarantee the encoding is invariant w.r.t. the choice of cycle basis, we encode the cycle information via the orthogonal projector of the cycle basis, which is inspired by BasisNet proposed by Lim et al. We also develop a more efficient variant which however requires that the input graph has a unique shortest cycle basis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module, we provide some theoretical understandings of its expressive power.

In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets.

Predictive divergence, measured using Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences, evaluates model accuracy by comparing predictions with those of two supplementary models.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precision medicine tailored to individual patients has gained significant attention in recent times. Machine learning techniques are now employed to process personalized data from various sources, including images, genetics, and assessments. These techniques have demonstrated good outcomes in many clinical prediction tasks. Notably, the approach of constructing graphs by linking similar patients and then applying graph neural networks (GNNs) stands out, because related information from analogous patients are aggregated and considered for prediction. However, selecting the appropriate edge feature to define patient similarity and construct the graph is challenging, given that each patient is depicted by high-dimensional features from diverse sources. Previous studies rely on human expertise to select the edge feature, which is neither scalable nor efficient in pinpointing crucial edge features for complex diseases. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named \\ours, which can automatically select important features to construct multiple patient similarity graphs, and train GNNs based on these graphs as weak learners in adaptive boosting. \\ours{} is evaluated on two real-world medical scenarios and shows superiors performance",

    "title": "CRISP: Hybrid Structured Sparsity for Class-aware Model Pruning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning pipelines for classification tasks often train a universal model to achieve accuracy across a broad range of classes. However, a typical user encounters only a limited selection of classes regularly. This disparity provides an opportunity to enhance computational efficiency by tailoring models to focus on user-specific classes. Existing works rely on unstructured pruning, which introduces randomly distributed non-zero values in the model, making it unsuitable for hardware acceleration. Alternatively, some approaches employ structured pruning, such as channel pruning, but these tend to provide only minimal compression and may lead to reduced model accuracy. In this work, we propose CRISP, a novel pruning framework leveraging a hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M structured sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. Our pruning strategy is guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score, allowing us to retain weights crucial for user-specific classes. CRISP achieves high accuracy with minimal memory consumption for popular models like ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets. Moreover, CRISP delivers up to 14$\\times$ reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable accuracy.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) have demonstrated powerful predictive abilities by exploiting graph structural and temporal dynamics. However, the existing DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in dynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant with respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks with Invariance Promotion (I-DIDA) to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns, i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. By utilizing the disentangled patterns, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions and an environment inference module to infer the latent spatio-temporal environments, and minimize the variance of predictions among these intervened distributions and environments, so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts. Our work is the first study of spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The high capacity of deep learning models to learn complex patterns poses a significant challenge when confronted with label noise. The inability to differentiate clean and noisy labels ultimately results in poor generalization. We approach this problem by reassigning the label for each image using a new teacher-student based framework termed P-LC (pseudo-label correction). Traditional teacher-student networks are composed of teacher and student classifiers for knowledge distillation. In our novel approach, we reconfigure the teacher network into a triple encoder, leveraging the triplet loss to establish a pseudo-label correction system. As the student generates pseudo labels for a set of given images, the teacher learns to choose between the initially assigned labels and the pseudo labels. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN demonstrate P-LC's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across all noise levels, most notably in high noise. In addition, we introduce a noise level estimation to help assess model performance and inform the need for additional data cleaning procedures",

Recently, these models have been shown to provide useful guidance for the generation of 3D graphics assets. However, existing work in text-conditioned 3D generation faces fundamental constraints: (i) inability to generate detailed, multi-object scenes, (ii) inability to textually control multi-object configurations, and (iii) physically realistic scene composition. In this work, we propose CG3D, a method for compositionally generating scalable 3D assets that resolves these constraints. We find that explicit Gaussian radiance fields, parameterized to allow for compositions of objects, possess the capability to enable semantically and physically consistent scenes. By utilizing a guidance framework built around this explicit representation, we show state of the art results, capable of even exceeding the guiding diffusion model in terms of object combinations and physics accuracy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There is a significant disconnect between linguistic theory and modern NLP practice, which relies heavily on inscrutable black-box architectures. DisCoCirc is a newly proposed model for meaning that aims to bridge this divide, by providing neuro-symbolic models that incorporate linguistic structure. DisCoCirc represents natural language text as a `circuit' that captures the core semantic information of the text. These circuits can then be interpreted as modular machine learning models. Additionally, DisCoCirc fulfils another major aim of providing an NLP model that can be implemented on near-term quantum computers. In this paper we describe a software pipeline that converts English text to its DisCoCirc representation. The pipeline achieves coverage over a large fragment of the English language. It relies on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parses of the input text as well as coreference resolution information. This semantic and syntactic information is used in several steps to convert the text into a simply-typed $\\lambda$-calculus term, and then into a circuit diagram. This pipeline will enable the application of the DisCoCirc framework to NLP tasks, using both classical and quantum approaches",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the field of Deep Learning has seen many disruptive and impactful advancements. Given the increasing complexity of deep neural networks, the need for efficient hardware accelerators has become more and more pressing to design heterogeneous HPC platforms. The design of Deep Learning accelerators requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining expertise from several areas, spanning from computer architecture to approximate computing, computational models, and machine learning algorithms. Several methodologies and tools have been proposed to design accelerators for Deep Learning, including hardware-software co-design approaches, high-level synthesis methods, specific customized compilers, and methodologies for design space exploration, modeling, and simulation. These methodologies aim to maximize the exploitable parallelism and minimize data movement to achieve high performance and energy efficiency. This survey provides a holistic review of the most influential design methodologies and EDA tools proposed in recent years to implement Deep Learning accelerators, offering the reader a wide perspective in this rapidly evolving field. In particular, this work complements the previous survey proposed by the same authors in [203], which focuses on Deep Learning hardware accelerators for heterogeneous HPC platforms",

We further demonstrate that multi-task psychological stress models outperform the current state-of-the-art for minority stress detection without directly training on minority stress data. We provide explanatory analysis showing that minority communities have different distributions of emotions than the general population and that emotion-infused models improve the performance of stress models on underrepresented groups because of their effectiveness in low-data environments, and we propose that integrating emotions may benefit underrepresented groups in other mental health detection tasks",

Several publicly available databases of fake synthetic video and speech were built to aid the development of detection methods. However, existing databases typically focus on visual or voice modalities and provide no proof that their deepfakes can in fact impersonate any real person. In this paper, we present the first realistic audio-visual database of deepfakes SWAN-DF, where lips and speech are well synchronized and video have high visual and audio qualities. We took the publicly available SWAN dataset of real videos with different identities to create audio-visual deepfakes using several models from DeepFaceLab and blending techniques for face swapping and HiFiVC, DiffVC, YourTTS, and FreeVC models for voice conversion. From the publicly available speech dataset LibriTTS, we also created a separate database of only audio deepfakes LibriTTS-DF using several latest text to speech methods: YourTTS, Adaspeech, and TorToiSe. We demonstrate the vulnerability of a state of the art speaker recognition system, such as ECAPA-TDNN-based model from SpeechBrain, to the synthetic voices. Similarly, we tested face recognition system based on the MobileFaceNet architecture to several variants of our visual deepfakes. The vulnerability assessment show that by tuning the existing pretrained deepfake models to specific identities, one can successfully spoof the face and speaker recognition systems in more than 90% of the time and achieve a very realistic looking and sounding fake video of a given person",

Motivated by the insight that Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a generalization to Supervised Learning (SL) for Natural Language Generation, and thereby performs better (empirically) than SL, we use an RL-based approach for this task of QfS. Additionally, we also resolve the conflict of employing RL in Transformers with Teacher Forcing. We develop multiple Policy Gradient networks, trained on various reward signals: ROUGE, BLEU, and Semantic Similarity, which lead to a 10-point improvement over the State-of-the-Art approach on the ROUGE-L metric for a benchmark dataset (ELI5). We also show performance of our approach in zero-shot setting for another benchmark dataset (DebatePedia) -- our approach leads to results comparable to baselines, which were specifically trained on DebatePedia. To aid the RL training, we propose a better semantic similarity reward, enabled by a novel Passage Embedding scheme developed using Cluster Hypothesis. Lastly, we contribute a gold-standard test dataset to further research in QfS and Long-form Question Answering (LfQA)",

This paper introduces Taiwan LLM, a pioneering Large Language Model that specifically caters to the Traditional Chinese language, with a focus on the variant used in Taiwan. Leveraging a comprehensive pretraining corpus and instruction-finetuning datasets, we have developed a model that not only understands the complexities of Traditional Chinese but also embodies the cultural context of Taiwan. Taiwan LLM represents the first of its kind, a model that is not only linguistically accurate but also culturally resonant with its user base. Our evaluations demonstrate that Taiwan LLM achieves superior performance in understanding and generating Traditional Chinese text, outperforming existing models that are predominantly trained on Simplified Chinese or English. The open-source release of Taiwan LLM invites collaboration and further innovation, ensuring that the linguistic diversity of Chinese speakers is embraced and well-served.

Diving deep into this domain, our exploration shines light on the interplay between depolarization noise and adversarial robustness. While previous results enhanced robustness from adversarial threats through depolarization noise, our findings paint a different picture.

To overcome such challenges, we present a novel learning-driven ZT conceptual architecture designed for DCCS. We aim to enhance ZT architecture service quality by incorporating lightweight learning strategies such as Representation Learning (ReL) and distributing ZT components across the computing continuum.

Unlike previous methods that primarily focused on downstream fine-tuning with short video clips, MM-Narrator excels in generating precise audio descriptions for videos of extensive lengths, even beyond hours, in an autoregressive manner. This capability is made possible by the proposed memory-augmented generation process, which effectively utilizes both the short-term textual context and long-term visual memory through an efficient register-and-recall mechanism. These contextual memories compile pertinent past information, including storylines and character identities, ensuring an accurate tracking and depicting of story-coherent and character-centric audio descriptions. Maintaining the training-free design of MM-Narrator, we further propose a complexity-based demonstration selection strategy to largely enhance its multi-step reasoning capability via few-shot multimodal in-context learning (MM-ICL). Experimental results on MAD-eval dataset demonstrate that MM-Narrator consistently outperforms both the existing fine-tuning-based approaches and LLM-based approaches in most scenarios, as measured by standard evaluation metrics.

    "abstract": "Prompt-based learning has been widely applied in many low-resource NLP tasks such as few-shot scenarios. However, this paradigm has been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most of the existing attack methods focus on inserting manually predefined templates as triggers in the pre-training phase to train the victim model and utilize the same triggers in the downstream task to perform inference, which tends to ignore the transferability and stealthiness of the templates. In this work, we propose a novel approach of TARGET (Template-trAnsfeRable backdoor attack aGainst prompt-basEd NLP models via GPT4), which is a data-independent attack method. Specifically, we first utilize GPT4 to reformulate manual templates to generate tone-strong and normal templates, and the former are injected into the model as a backdoor trigger in the pre-training phase. Then, we not only directly employ the above templates in the downstream task, but also use GPT4 to generate templates with similar tone to the above templates to carry out transferable attacks. Finally we have conducted extensive experiments on five NLP datasets and three BERT series models, with experimental results justifying that our TARGET method has better attack performance and stealthiness compared to the two-external baseline methods on direct attacks, and in addition achieves satisfactory attack capability in the unseen tone-similar templates",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal human action segmentation is a critical and challenging task with a wide range of applications. Nowadays, the majority of approaches concentrate on the fusion of dense signals (i.e., RGB, optical flow, and depth maps). However, the potential contributions of sparse IoT sensor signals, which can be crucial for achieving accurate recognition, have not been fully explored. To make up for this, we introduce a Sparse signalguided Transformer (SigFormer) to combine both dense and sparse signals. We employ mask attention to fuse localized features by constraining cross-attention within the regions where sparse signals are valid. However, since sparse signals are discrete, they lack sufficient information about the temporal action boundaries. Therefore, in SigFormer, we propose to emphasize the boundary information at two stages to alleviate this problem. In the first feature extraction stage, we introduce an intermediate bottleneck module to jointly learn both category and boundary features of each dense modality through the inner loss functions. After the fusion of dense modalities and sparse signals, we then devise a two-branch architecture that explicitly models the interrelationship between action category and temporal boundary. Experimental results demonstrate that SigFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on a multi-modal action segmentation dataset from real industrial environments, reaching an outstanding F1 score of 0.958.

Our proposed representation maintains a comprehensive record of an object's attributes and changes, enabling robust retrospective summary of the sequence of actions leading to the current state.

We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently.

    "abstract": "The problem of firebreak placement is crucial for fire prevention, and its effectiveness at landscape scale will depend on their ability to impede the progress of future wildfires. To provide an adequate response, it is therefore necessary to consider the stochastic nature of fires, which are highly unpredictable from ignition to extinction. Thus, the placement of firebreaks can be considered a stochastic optimization problem where: (1) the objective function is to minimize the expected cells burnt of the landscape; (2) the decision variables being the location of firebreaks; and (3) the random variable being the spatial propagation/behavior of fires. In this paper, we propose a solution approach for the problem from the perspective of simulation-based optimization (SbO), where the objective function is not available (a black-box function), but can be computed (and/or approximated) by wildfire simulations. For this purpose, Genetic Algorithm and GRASP are implemented. The final implementation yielded favorable results for the Genetic Algorithm, demonstrating strong performance in scenarios with medium to high operational capacity, as well as medium levels of stochasticity",

Recent advances in remote sensing technology combined with the increasing application of artificial intelligence methods have improved real-time, high-resolution fire monitoring. This study explores two proposed approaches based on the U-Net model for automating and optimizing the burned-area mapping process. Denoted 128 and AllSizes (AS), they are trained on datasets with a different class balance by cropping input images to different sizes. They are then applied to Landsat imagery and time-series data from two fire-prone regions in Chile. The results obtained after enhancement of model performance by hyperparameter optimization demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches. Tests based on 195 representative images of the study area show that increasing dataset balance using the AS model yields better performance. More specifically, AS exhibited a Dice Coefficient (DC) of 0.93, an Omission Error (OE) of 0.086, and a Commission Error (CE) of 0.045, while the 128 model achieved a DC of 0.86, an OE of 0.12, and a CE of 0.12.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Public events, such as concerts and sports games, can be major attractors for large crowds, leading to irregular surges in travel demand. Accurate human mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City, based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs that remain barriers to their broader adoption in large-scale human mobility analysis",

    "abstract": "Identity-consistent video generation seeks to synthesize videos that are guided by both textual prompts and reference images of entities. Current approaches typically utilize cross-attention layers to integrate the appearance of the entity, which predominantly captures semantic attributes, resulting in compromised fidelity of entities. Moreover, these methods necessitate iterative fine-tuning for each new entity encountered, thereby limiting their applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoAssembler, a novel end-to-end framework for identity-consistent video generation that can conduct inference directly when encountering new entities. VideoAssembler is adept at producing videos that are not only flexible with respect to the input reference entities but also responsive to textual conditions. Additionally, by modulating the quantity of input images for the entity, VideoAssembler enables the execution of tasks ranging from image-to-video generation to sophisticated video editing. VideoAssembler comprises two principal components: the Reference Entity Pyramid (REP) encoder and the Entity-Prompt Attention Fusion (EPAF) module. The REP encoder is designed to infuse comprehensive appearance details into the denoising stages of the stable diffusion model. Concurrently, the EPAF module is utilized to integrate text-aligned features effectively. Furthermore, to mitigate the challenge of scarce data, we present a methodology for the preprocessing of training data. Our evaluation of the VideoAssembler framework on the UCF-101, MSR-VTT, and DAVIS datasets indicates that it achieves good performances in both quantitative and qualitative analyses (346.84 in FVD and 48.01 in IS on UCF-101).

In this work, we propose Universal Self-Consistency (USC), which leverages LLMs themselves to select the most consistent answer among multiple candidates. We evaluate USC on a variety of benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, long-context summarization, and open-ended question answering. On open-ended generation tasks where the original self-consistency method is not applicable, USC effectively utilizes multiple samples and improves the performance. For mathematical reasoning, USC matches the standard self-consistency performance without requiring the answer formats to be similar. Finally, without access to execution results, USC also matches the execution-based voting performance on code generation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription is the most critical form of TCM treatment, and uncovering the complex nonlinear relationship between symptoms and TCM is of great significance for clinical practice and assisting physicians in diagnosis and treatment. Although there have been some studies on TCM prescription generation, these studies consider a single factor and directly model the symptom-prescription generation problem mainly based on symptom descriptions, lacking guidance from TCM knowledge. To this end, we propose a RoBERTa and Knowledge Enhancement model for Prescription Generation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (RoKEPG). RoKEPG is firstly pre-trained by our constructed TCM corpus, followed by fine-tuning the pre-trained model, and the model is guided to generate TCM prescriptions by introducing four classes of knowledge of TCM through the attention mask matrix. Experimental results on the publicly available TCM prescription dataset show that RoKEPG improves the F1 metric by about 2% over the baseline model with the best results",

However, while popular, the system's suitability for assessing entities with constant skill levels, such as LLMs, remains relatively unexplored. We study two fundamental axioms that evaluation methods should adhere to: reliability and transitivity. We conduct extensive evaluation of Elo behaviour, illustrating that individual Elo computations exhibit volatility and delving into the impact of varying the Elo rating system's hyperparameters. We show that these axioms are not always satisfied raising questions about the reliability of current comparative evaluations of LLMs. If the current use of Elo scores is intended to substitute the costly head-to-head comparison of LLMs, it is crucial to ensure the ranking is as robust as possible. Guided by the axioms, our findings offer concrete guidelines for enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluation methods, suggesting a need for reassessment of existing comparative approaches",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Incorporating prior information into inverse problems, e.g. via maximum-a-posteriori estimation, is an important technique for facilitating robust inverse problem solutions. In this paper, we devise two novel approaches for linear inverse problems that permit problem-specific statistical prior selections within the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. The CG class subsumes many commonly used priors in signal and image reconstruction methods including those of sparsity-based approaches. The first method developed is an iterative algorithm, called generalized compound Gaussian least squares (G-CG-LS), that minimizes a regularized least squares objective function where the regularization enforces a CG prior. G-CG-LS is then unrolled, or unfolded, to furnish our second method, which is a novel deep regularized (DR) neural network, called DR-CG-Net, that learns the prior information. A detailed computational theory on convergence properties of G-CG-LS and thorough numerical experiments for DR-CG-Net are provided. Due to the comprehensive nature of the CG prior, these experiments show that our unrolled DR-CG-Net outperforms competitive prior art methods in tomographic imaging and compressive sensing, especially in challenging low-training scenarios",

    "abstract": "Computational models trained on a large amount of natural images are the state-of-the-art to study human vision - usually adult vision. Computational models of infant vision and its further development are gaining more and more attention in the community. In this work we aim at the very beginning of our visual experience - pre- and post-natal retinal waves which suggest to be a pre-training mechanism for the primate visual system at a very early stage of development. We see this approach as an instance of biologically plausible data driven inductive bias through pre-training. We built a computational model that mimics this development mechanism by pre-training different artificial convolutional neural networks with simulated retinal wave images. The resulting features of this biologically plausible pre-training closely match the V1 features of the primate visual system. We show that the performance gain by pre-training with retinal waves is similar to a state-of-the art pre-training pipeline. Our framework contains the retinal wave generator, as well as a training strategy, which can be a first step in a curriculum learning based training diet for various models of development. We release code, data and trained networks to build the basis for future work on visual development and based on a curriculum learning approach including prenatal development to support studies of innate vs. learned properties of the primate visual system. An additional benefit of our pre-trained networks for neuroscience or computer vision applications is the absence of biases inherited from datasets like ImageNet",

By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies.

However, the limitation of bounding boxes in detecting non-rigid objects and backgrounds often causes VidSGG to miss key details crucial for comprehensive video understanding. In contrast, PVSG requires nodes in scene graphs to be grounded by more precise, pixel-level segmentation masks, which facilitate holistic scene understanding. To advance research in this new area, we contribute the PVSG dataset, which consists of 400 videos (289 third-person + 111 egocentric videos) with a total of 150K frames labeled with panoptic segmentation masks as well as fine, temporal scene graphs.

However, extending in-context learning to large vision-language models (VLMs) using a huge amount of naturalistic vision-language data has shown limited success, particularly for egocentric videos, due to high data collection costs. We propose a novel training method $\\mathbb{E}$fficient $\\mathbb{I}$n-context $\\mathbb{L}$earning on $\\mathbb{E}$gocentric $\\mathbb{V}$ideos ($\\mathbb{EILEV}$), which elicits in-context learning in VLMs for egocentric videos without requiring massive, naturalistic egocentric video datasets. $\\mathbb{EILEV}$ involves architectural and training data adaptations to allow the model to process contexts interleaved with video clips and narrations, sampling of in-context examples with clusters of similar verbs and nouns, use of data with skewed marginal distributions with a long tail of infrequent verbs and nouns, as well as homonyms and synonyms. Our evaluations show that $\\mathbb{EILEV}$-trained models outperform larger VLMs trained on a huge amount of naturalistic data in in-context learning. Furthermore, they can generalize to not only out-of-distribution, but also novel, rare egocentric videos and texts via in-context learning, demonstrating potential for applications requiring cost-effective training, and rapid post-deployment adaptability.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Due to the depth degradation effect in residual connections, many efficient Vision Transformers models that rely on stacking layers for information exchange often fail to form sufficient information mixing, leading to unnatural visual perception. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose Aggregated Attention, a biomimetic design-based token mixer that simulates biological foveal vision and continuous eye movement while enabling each token on the feature map to have a global perception. Furthermore, we incorporate learnable tokens that interact with conventional queries and keys, which further diversifies the generation of affinity matrices beyond merely relying on the similarity between queries and keys. Our approach does not rely on stacking for information exchange, thus effectively avoiding depth degradation and achieving natural visual perception. Additionally, we propose Convolutional GLU, a channel mixer that bridges the gap between GLU and SE mechanism, which empowers each token to have channel attention based on its nearest neighbor image features, enhancing local modeling capability and model robustness. We combine aggregated attention and convolutional GLU to create a new visual backbone called TransNeXt. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TransNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple model sizes. At a resolution of $224^2$, TransNeXt-Tiny attains an ImageNet accuracy of 84.0%, surpassing ConvNeXt-B with 69% fewer parameters.

Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of external tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Lifting 2D diffusion for 3D generation is a challenging problem due to the lack of geometric prior and the complex entanglement of materials and lighting in natural images. Existing methods have shown promise by first creating the geometry through score-distillation sampling (SDS) applied to rendered surface normals, followed by appearance modeling. However, relying on a 2D RGB diffusion model to optimize surface normals is suboptimal due to the distribution discrepancy between natural images and normals maps, leading to instability in optimization. In this paper, recognizing that the normal and depth information effectively describe scene geometry and be automatically estimated from images, we propose to learn a generalizable Normal-Depth diffusion model for 3D generation. We achieve this by training on the large-scale LAION dataset together with the generalizable image-to-depth and normal prior models. In an attempt to alleviate the mixed illumination effects in the generated materials, we introduce an albedo diffusion model to impose data-driven constraints on the albedo component. Our experiments show that when integrated into existing text-to-3D pipelines, our models significantly enhance the detail richness, achieving state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "The design of Wireless Networked Control System (WNCS) requires addressing critical interactions between control and communication systems with minimal complexity and communication overhead while providing ultra-high reliability. This paper introduces a novel optimization theory based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for the joint design of controller and communication systems. The objective of minimum power consumption is targeted while satisfying the schedulability and rate constraints of the communication system in the finite blocklength regime and stability constraint of the control system. Decision variables include the sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error probability in the communication system. The proposed framework contains two stages: optimization theory and DRL. In the optimization theory stage, following the formulation of the joint optimization problem, optimality conditions are derived to find the mathematical relations between the optimal values of the decision variables. These relations allow the decomposition of the problem into multiple building blocks. In the DRL stage, the blocks that are simplified but not tractable are replaced by DRL. Via extensive simulations, the proposed optimization theory based DRL approach is demonstrated to outperform the optimization theory and pure DRL based approaches, with close to optimal performance and much lower complexity",

For the untargeted case, we measure the Character Error Rate (CER), while for the targeted case we use the success ratio. We find that TrOCR is highly vulnerable to untargeted attacks and somewhat less vulnerable to targeted attacks. On a benchmark handwriting data set, untargeted attacks can cause a CER of more than 1 without being noticeable to the eye. With a similar perturbation size, targeted attacks can lead to success rates of around $25\\%$ -- here we attacked single tokens, requiring TrOCR to output the tenth most likely token from a large vocabulary",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is a fundamental challenge for any autonomous vehicle, independent of whether it operates in sea, air, or land. This paper proposes a two-step architecture for handling DOA tasks by combining supervised and reinforcement learning (RL). In the first step, we introduce a data-driven approach to estimate the collision risk of an obstacle using a recurrent neural network, which is trained in a supervised fashion and offers robustness to non-linear obstacle movements. In the second step, we include these collision risk estimates into the observation space of an RL agent to increase its situational awareness.~We illustrate the power of our two-step approach by training different RL agents in a challenging environment that requires to navigate amid multiple obstacles. The non-linear movements of obstacles are exemplarily modeled based on stochastic processes and periodic patterns, although our architecture is suitable for any obstacle dynamics. The experiments reveal that integrating our collision risk metrics into the observation space doubles the performance in terms of reward, which is equivalent to halving the number of collisions in the considered environment. Furthermore, we show that the architecture's performance improvement is independent of the applied RL algorithm",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Action advising endeavors to leverage supplementary guidance from expert teachers to alleviate the issue of sampling inefficiency in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Previous agent-specific action advising methods are hindered by imperfections in the agent itself, while agent-agnostic approaches exhibit limited adaptability to the learning agent. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Agent-Aware trAining yet Agent-Agnostic Action Advising (A7) to strike a balance between the two. The underlying concept of A7 revolves around utilizing the similarity of state features as an indicator for soliciting advice. However, unlike prior methodologies, the measurement of state feature similarity is performed by neither the error-prone learning agent nor the agent-agnostic advisor. Instead, we employ a proxy model to extract state features that are both discriminative (adaptive to the agent) and generally applicable (robust to agent noise). Furthermore, we utilize behavior cloning to train a model for reusing advice and introduce an intrinsic reward for the advised samples to incentivize the utilization of expert guidance. Experiments are conducted on the GridWorld, LunarLander, and six prominent scenarios from Atari games. The results demonstrate that A7 significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses existing methods (both agent-specific and agent-agnostic) by a substantial margin.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a method to address the challenge of rendering a 3D human from a single image in a free-view manner. Some existing approaches could achieve this by using generalizable pixel-aligned implicit fields to reconstruct a textured mesh of a human or by employing a 2D diffusion model as guidance with the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method, to lift the 2D image into 3D space. However, a generalizable implicit field often results in an over-smooth texture field, while the SDS method tends to lead to a texture-inconsistent novel view with the input image. In this paper, we introduce a texture-consistent back view synthesis module that could transfer the reference image content to the back view through depth and text-guided attention injection. Moreover, to alleviate the color distortion that occurs in the side region, we propose a visibility-aware patch consistency regularization for texture mapping and refinement combined with the synthesized back view texture. With the above techniques, we could achieve high-fidelity and texture-consistent human rendering from a single image. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our approach outperforms previous baseline methods",

This survey delves into the historical trajectory of dialogue systems, elucidating their intricate relationship with advancements in language models by categorizing this evolution into four distinct stages, each marked by pivotal LM breakthroughs: 1) Early_Stage: characterized by statistical LMs, resulting in rule-based or machine-learning-driven dialogue_systems; 2) Independent development of TOD and ODD based on neural_language_models (NLM; e.g., LSTM and GRU), since NLMs lack intrinsic knowledge in their parameters; 3) fusion between different types of dialogue systems with the advert of pre-trained_language_models (PLMs), starting from the fusion between four_sub-tasks_within_TOD, and then TOD_with_ODD; and 4) current LLM-based_dialogue_system, wherein LLMs can be used to conduct TOD and ODD seamlessly. Thus, our survey provides a chronological perspective aligned with LM breakthroughs, offering a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research outcomes. What's more, we focus on emerging topics and discuss open challenges, providing valuable insights into future directions for LLM-based_dialogue_systems.

    "title": "The curse of language biases in remote sensing VQA: the role of spatial attributes, language diversity, and the need for clear evaluation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Remote sensing visual question answering (RSVQA) opens new opportunities for the use of overhead imagery by the general public, by enabling human-machine interaction with natural language. Building on the recent advances in natural language processing and computer vision, the goal of RSVQA is to answer a question formulated in natural language about a remote sensing image. Language understanding is essential to the success of the task, but has not yet been thoroughly examined in RSVQA. In particular, the problem of language biases is often overlooked in the remote sensing community, which can impact model robustness and lead to wrong conclusions about the performances of the model. Thus, the present work aims at highlighting the problem of language biases in RSVQA with a threefold analysis strategy: visual blind models, adversarial testing and dataset analysis. This analysis focuses both on model and data. Moreover, we motivate the use of more informative and complementary evaluation metrics sensitive to the issue. The gravity of language biases in RSVQA is then exposed for all of these methods with the training of models discarding the image data and the manipulation of the visual input during inference. Finally, a detailed analysis of question-answer distribution demonstrates the root of the problem in the data itself. Thanks to this analytical study, we observed that biases in remote sensing are more severe than in standard VQA, likely due to the specifics of existing remote sensing datasets for the task, e.g. geographical similarities and sparsity, as well as a simpler vocabulary and question generation strategies. While new, improved and less-biased datasets appear as a necessity for the development of the promising field of RSVQA, we demonstrate that more informed, relative evaluation metrics remain much needed to transparently communicate results of future RSVQA methods",

Attackers in the real world are predominantly human actors, and the protection methods often incorporate opponent models to improve the performance when facing humans. Previous results show that modeling human behavior can significantly improve the performance of the algorithms. However, modeling humans correctly is a complex problem, and the models are often simplified and assume humans make mistakes according to some distribution or train parameters for the whole population from which they sample. In this work, we use data gathered by psychologists who identified personality types that increase the likelihood of performing malicious acts. However, in the previous work, the tests on a handmade game could not show strategic differences between the models. We created a novel model that links its parameters to psychological traits. We optimized over parametrized games and created games in which the differences are profound. Our work can help with automatic game generation when we need a game in which some models will behave differently and to identify situations in which the models do not align",

    "abstract": "Collaborative perception has recently gained significant attention in autonomous driving, improving perception quality by enabling the exchange of additional information among vehicles. However, deploying collaborative perception systems can lead to domain shifts due to diverse environmental conditions and data heterogeneity among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To address these challenges, we propose a unified domain generalization framework applicable in both training and inference stages of collaborative perception. In the training phase, we introduce an Amplitude Augmentation (AmpAug) method to augment low-frequency image variations, broadening the model's ability to learn across various domains. We also employ a meta-consistency training scheme to simulate domain shifts, optimizing the model with a carefully designed consistency loss to encourage domain-invariant representations. In the inference phase, we introduce an intra-system domain alignment mechanism to reduce or potentially eliminate the domain discrepancy among CAVs prior to inference. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the existing state-of-the-art works.

    "abstract": "GNN-based recommenders have excelled in modeling intricate user-item interactions through multi-hop message passing. However, existing methods often overlook the dynamic nature of evolving user-item interactions, which impedes the adaption to changing user preferences and distribution shifts in newly arriving data. Thus, their scalability and performances in real-world dynamic environments are limited. In this study, we propose GraphPL, a framework that incorporates parameter-efficient and dynamic graph pre-training with prompt learning. This novel combination empowers GNNs to effectively capture both long-term user preferences and short-term behavior dynamics, enabling the delivery of accurate and timely recommendations. Our GraphPL framework addresses the challenge of evolving user preferences by seamlessly integrating a temporal prompt mechanism and a graph-structural prompt learning mechanism into the pre-trained GNN model. The temporal prompt mechanism encodes time information on user-item interaction, allowing the model to naturally capture temporal context, while the graph-structural prompt learning mechanism enables the transfer of pre-trained knowledge to adapt to behavior dynamics without the need for continuous incremental training. We further bring in a dynamic evaluation setting for recommendation to mimic real-world dynamic scenarios and bridge the offline-online gap to a better level. Our extensive experiments including a large-scale industrial deployment showcases the lightweight plug-in scalability of our GraphPL when integrated with various state-of-the-art recommenders, emphasizing the advantages of GraphPL in terms of effectiveness, robustness and efficiency",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Ensuring both transparency and safety is critical when deploying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in high-risk applications, such as medicine. The field of explainable AI (XAI) has proposed various methods to comprehend the decision-making processes of opaque DNNs. However, only few XAI methods are suitable of ensuring safety in practice as they heavily rely on repeated labor-intensive and possibly biased human assessment. In this work, we present a novel post-hoc concept-based XAI framework that conveys besides instance-wise (local) also class-wise (global) decision-making strategies via prototypes. What sets our approach apart is the combination of local and global strategies, enabling a clearer understanding of the (dis-)similarities in model decisions compared to the expected (prototypical) concept use, ultimately reducing the dependence on human long-term assessment. Quantifying the deviation from prototypical behavior not only allows to associate predictions with specific model sub-strategies but also to detect outlier behavior. As such, our approach constitutes an intuitive and explainable tool for model validation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying out-of-distribution samples, spurious model behavior and data quality issues across three datasets (ImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-10) utilizing VGG, ResNet, and EfficientNet architectures.

To overcome these issues we propose Robotic Policy Inference via Synthetic Observations (ROSO). ROSO uses stable diffusion to pre-process a robot's observation of novel objects during inference time to fit within its distribution of observations of the pre-trained policies. This novel paradigm allows us to transfer learned knowledge from known tasks to previously unseen scenarios, enhancing the robot's adaptability without requiring lengthy fine-tuning.

As a result, three misconception categories were identified: 1) Non-technological AI, in which AI was conceptualized as peoples' cognitive processes (factual misconception); 2) Anthropomorphic AI, in which AI was conceptualized as a human-like entity (vernacular, non-scientific, and conceptual misconception); and 3) AI as a machine with a pre-installed intelligence or knowledge (factual misconception). Majority of the children evaluated their AI-knowledge low, which implies that the misconceptions are more superficial than profound. The findings suggest that context-specific linguistic features can contribute to students' AI misconceptions. Implications for future research and AI literacy education are discussed",

    "abstract": "Systolic arrays are a prominent choice for deep neural network (DNN) accelerators because they offer parallelism and efficient data reuse. Improving the reliability of DNN accelerators is crucial as hardware faults can degrade the accuracy of DNN inferencing. Systolic arrays make use of a large number of processing elements (PEs) for parallel processing, but when one PE is faulty, the error propagates and affects the outcomes of downstream PEs. Due to the large number of PEs, the cost associated with implementing hardware-based runtime monitoring of every single PE is infeasible. We present a solution to optimize the placement of hardware monitors within systolic arrays. We first prove that $2N-1$ monitors are needed to localize a single faulty PE and we also derive the monitor placement. We show that a second placement optimization problem, which minimizes the set of candidate faulty PEs for a given number of monitors, is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic approach to balance the reliability and hardware resource utilization in DNN accelerators when number of monitors is limited. Experimental evaluation shows that to localize a single faulty PE, an area overhead of only 0.33% is incurred for a $256\\times 256$ systolic array",

    "title": "StreamFlow: Streamlined Multi-Frame Optical Flow Estimation for Video Sequences",

    "abstract": "Occlusions between consecutive frames have long posed a significant challenge in optical flow estimation. The inherent ambiguity introduced by occlusions directly violates the brightness constancy constraint and considerably hinders pixel-to-pixel matching. To address this issue, multi-frame optical flow methods leverage adjacent frames to mitigate the local ambiguity. Nevertheless, prior multi-frame methods predominantly adopt recursive flow estimation, resulting in a considerable computational overlap. In contrast, we propose a streamlined in-batch framework that eliminates the need for extensive redundant recursive computations while concurrently developing effective spatio-temporal modeling approaches under in-batch estimation constraints. Specifically, we present a Streamlined In-batch Multi-frame (SIM) pipeline tailored to video input, attaining a similar level of time efficiency to two-frame networks. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient Integrative Spatio-temporal Coherence (ISC) modeling method for effective spatio-temporal modeling during the encoding phase, which introduces no additional parameter overhead. Additionally, we devise a Global Temporal Regressor (GTR) that effectively explores temporal relations during decoding. Benefiting from the efficient SIM pipeline and effective modules, StreamFlow not only excels in terms of performance on the challenging KITTI and Sintel datasets, with particular improvement in occluded areas but also attains a remarkable $63.82\\%$ enhancement in speed compared with previous multi-frame methods.

    "title": "DyRA: Dynamic Resolution Adjustment for Scale-robust Object Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In object detection, achieving constant accuracy is challenging due to the variability of object sizes. One possible solution to this problem is to optimize the input resolution, known as a multi-resolution strategy. Previous approaches for optimizing resolution are often based on pre-defined resolutions or a dynamic neural network, but there is a lack of study for run-time resolution optimization for existing architecture. In this paper, we propose an adaptive resolution scaling network called DyRA, which comprises convolutions and transformer encoder blocks, for existing detectors. Our DyRA returns a scale factor from an input image, which enables instance-specific scaling. This network is jointly trained with detectors with specially designed loss functions, namely ParetoScaleLoss and BalanceLoss. The ParetoScaleLoss produces an adaptive scale factor from the image, while the BalanceLoss optimizes the scale factor according to localization power for the dataset. The loss function is designed to minimize accuracy drop about the contrasting objective of small and large objects. Our experiments on COCO, RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN, FCOS, and Mask-RCNN achieved 1.3%, 1.1%, 1.3%, and 0.8% accuracy improvement than a multi-resolution baseline with solely resolution adjustment.

    "title": "Plug-and-Play, Dense-Label-Free Extraction of Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from Vision-Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "From an enormous amount of image-text pairs, large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) learn to implicitly associate image regions with words, which is vital for tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, leveraging such pre-trained models for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet extremely effective, training-free technique, Plug-and-Play Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (PnP-OVSS) for this task. PnP-OVSS leverages a VLM with direct text-to-image cross-attention and an image-text matching loss to produce semantic segmentation. However, cross-attention alone tends to over-segment, whereas cross-attention plus GradCAM tend to under-segment. To alleviate this issue, we introduce Salience Dropout; by iteratively dropping patches that the model is most attentive to, we are able to better resolve the entire extent of the segmentation mask. Compared to existing techniques, the proposed method does not require any neural network training and performs hyperparameter tuning without the need for any segmentation annotations, even for a validation set. PnP-OVSS demonstrates substantial improvements over a comparable baseline (+29.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC, +13.2% mIoU on Pascal Context, +14.0% mIoU on MS COCO, +2.4% mIoU on COCO Stuff) and even outperforms most baselines that conduct additional network training on top of pretrained VLMs",

This paper presents a pioneering survey on the emerging domain of graph prompts in AGI, addressing key challenges and opportunities in harnessing graph data for AGI applications. Despite substantial advancements in AGI across natural language processing and computer vision, the application to graph data is relatively underexplored. This survey critically evaluates the current landscape of AGI in handling graph data, highlighting the distinct challenges in cross-modality, cross-domain, and cross-task applications specific to graphs. Our work is the first to propose a unified framework for understanding graph prompt learning, offering clarity on prompt tokens, token structures, and insertion patterns in the graph domain. We delve into the intrinsic properties of graph prompts, exploring their flexibility, expressiveness, and interplay with existing graph models. A comprehensive taxonomy categorizes over 100 works in this field, aligning them with pre-training tasks across node-level, edge-level, and graph-level objectives. Additionally, we present, ProG, a Python library, and an accompanying website, to support and advance research in graph prompting. The survey culminates in a discussion of current challenges and future directions, offering a roadmap for research in graph prompting within AGI. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to catalyze further exploration and practical applications of AGI in graph data, underlining its potential to reshape AGI fields and beyond.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have been used successfully to fit distributions for cross-modal data translation and multimodal data generation. However, these methods rely on extensive scaling, overlooking the inefficiency and interference between modalities. We develop Partially Shared U-Net (PS-U-Net) architecture which is an efficient multimodal diffusion model that allows text and image inputs to pass through dedicated layers and skip-connections for preserving modality-specific fine-grained details. Inspired by image inpainting, we also propose a new efficient multimodal sampling method that introduces new scenarios for conditional generation while only requiring a simple joint distribution to be learned. Our empirical exploration of the MS-COCO dataset demonstrates that our method generates multimodal text and image data with higher quality compared to existing multimodal diffusion models while having a comparable size, faster training, faster multimodal sampling, and more flexible generation",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) are reshaping various aspects of human life, our current understanding of their impacts remains somewhat constrained. Here we investigate the impact of LLMs on human communication, in the context of consumer complaints in the financial industry. Employing an AI detection tool on more than 780K complaints gathered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we find evidence of LLM usage in the writing of complaints - shortly after the release of ChatGPT. Our analyses reveal that LLM usage is positively correlated with the likelihood of obtaining desirable outcomes (i.e., offer of relief from financial firms) and suggest that this positive correlation may be partly due to the linguistic features improved by LLMs. We test this conjecture with a preregistered experiment, which reveals results consistent with those from observational studies: Consumer complaints written with ChatGPT for improved linguistic qualities were more likely to receive hypothetical relief offers than the original consumer complaints, demonstrating the LLM's ability to enhance message persuasiveness in human communication. Being some of the earliest empirical evidence on LLM usage for enhancing persuasion, our results highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in human communication",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap: A Unified Video Comprehension Framework for Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection (HD) have attracted significant attention due to the growing demand for video analysis. Recent approaches treat MR and HD as similar video grounding problems and address them together with transformer-based architecture. However, we observe that the emphasis of MR and HD differs, with one necessitating the perception of local relationships and the other prioritizing the understanding of global contexts. Consequently, the lack of task-specific design will inevitably lead to limitations in associating the intrinsic specialty of two tasks. To tackle the issue, we propose a Unified Video COMprehension framework (UVCOM) to bridge the gap and jointly solve MR and HD effectively. By performing progressive integration on intra and inter-modality across multi-granularity, UVCOM achieves the comprehensive understanding in processing a video. Moreover, we present multi-aspect contrastive learning to consolidate the local relation modeling and global knowledge accumulation via well aligned multi-modal space. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, TACoS , YouTube Highlights and TVSum datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and rationality of UVCOM which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a remarkable margin",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting typhoon intensity accurately across space and time is crucial for issuing timely disaster warnings and facilitating emergency response. This has vast potential for minimizing life losses and property damages as well as reducing economic and environmental impacts. Leveraging satellite imagery for scenario analysis is effective but also introduces additional challenges due to the complex relations among clouds and the highly dynamic context. Existing deep learning methods in this domain rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which suffer from limited per-layer receptive fields. This limitation hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual knowledge during inference. In response, we introduce a novel approach, namely \"Typhoon Intensity Transformer\" (Tint), which leverages self-attention mechanisms with global receptive fields per layer. Tint adopts a sequence-to-sequence feature representation learning perspective. It begins by cutting a given satellite image into a sequence of patches and recursively employs self-attention operations to extract both local and global contextual relations between all patch pairs simultaneously, thereby enhancing per-patch feature representation learning. Extensive experiments on a publicly available typhoon benchmark validate the efficacy of Tint in comparison with both state-of-the-art deep learning and conventional meteorological methods.

    "title": "Multi-defender Security Games with Schedules",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Stackelberg Security Games are often used to model strategic interactions in high-stakes security settings. The majority of existing models focus on single-defender settings where a single entity assumes command of all security assets. However, many realistic scenarios feature multiple heterogeneous defenders with their own interests and priorities embedded in a more complex system. Furthermore, defenders rarely choose targets to protect. Instead, they have a multitude of defensive resources or schedules at its disposal, each with different protective capabilities. In this paper, we study security games featuring multiple defenders and schedules simultaneously. We show that unlike prior work on multi-defender security games, the introduction of schedules can cause non-existence of equilibrium even under rather restricted environments. We prove that under the mild restriction that any subset of a schedule is also a schedule, non-existence of equilibrium is not only avoided, but can be computed in polynomial time in games with two defenders. Under additional assumptions, our algorithm can be extended to games with more than two defenders and its computation scaled up in special classes of games with compactly represented schedules such as those used in patrolling applications. Experimental results suggest that our methods scale gracefully with game size, making our algorithms amongst the few that can tackle multiple heterogeneous defenders",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a wide range of tasks. However, these models are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concern in their adoption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a methodology to make Vision-and-Language models safer by removing their sensitivity to not-safe-for-work concepts. We show how this can be done by distilling from a large language model which converts between safe and unsafe sentences and which is fine-tuned starting from just 100 manually-curated pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for both retrieval and text-to-image generation, where we show that our model can also be properly employed with pre-trained image generators.

In pursuit of the ultimate goal of achieving artificial general intelligence, a truly intelligent Video-LLM model should not only see and understand the surroundings, but also possess human-level commonsense, and make well-informed decisions for the users. To guide the development of such a model, the establishment of a robust and comprehensive evaluation system becomes crucial. To this end, this paper proposes \\textit{Video-Bench}, a new comprehensive benchmark along with a toolkit specifically designed for evaluating Video-LLMs. The benchmark comprises 10 meticulously crafted tasks, evaluating the capabilities of Video-LLMs across three distinct levels: Video-exclusive Understanding, Prior Knowledge-based Question-Answering, and Comprehension and Decision-making. In addition, we introduce an automatic toolkit tailored to process model outputs for various tasks, facilitating the calculation of metrics and generating convenient final scores. We evaluate 8 representative Video-LLMs using \\textit{Video-Bench}. The findings reveal that current Video-LLMs still fall considerably short of achieving human-like comprehension and analysis of real-world videos, offering valuable insights for future research directions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Aiming to advance AI agents, large foundation models significantly improve reasoning and instruction execution, yet the current focus on vision and language neglects the potential of perceiving diverse modalities in open-world environments. However, the success of data-driven vision and language models is costly or even infeasible to be reproduced for rare modalities. In this paper, we present ViT-Lens-2 that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them to a pre-defined space. Specifically, the modality-specific lens is tuned to project any-modal signals to an intermediate embedding space, which are then processed by a strong ViT with pre-trained visual knowledge. The encoded representations are optimized toward aligning with the modal-independent space, pre-defined by off-the-shelf foundation models. ViT-Lens-2 provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters. We tailor ViT-Lens-2 to learn representations for 3D point cloud, depth, audio, tactile and EEG, and set new state-of-the-art results across various understanding tasks, such as zero-shot classification. By seamlessly integrating ViT-Lens-2 into Multimodal Foundation Models, we enable Any-modality to Text and Image Generation in a zero-shot manner.

THe implications of the framework are also discussed. This paper also presents a \"three-layer\" approach to facilitate the implementation of the framework. We believe the proposed framework is systematic and executable, which can overcome the weaknesses in current frameworks and the challenges currently faced in implementing HCAI.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) based methods have shown great promise in network intrusion detection by identifying malicious network traffic behavior patterns with high accuracy, but their applications to real-time, packet-level detections in high-speed communication networks are challenging due to the high computation time and resource requirements of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), as well as lack of explainability. To this end, we propose a packet-level network intrusion detection solution that makes novel use of Recurrent Autoencoders to integrate an arbitrary-length sequence of packets into a more compact joint feature embedding, which is fed into a DNN-based classifier. To enable explainability and support real-time detections at micro-second speed, we further develop a Software-Hardware Co-Design approach to efficiently realize the proposed solution by converting the learned detection policies into decision trees and implementing them using an emerging architecture based on memristor devices. By jointly optimizing associated software and hardware constraints, we show that our approach leads to an extremely efficient, real-time solution with high detection accuracy at the packet level. Evaluation results on real-world datasets (e.g., UNSW and CIC-IDS datasets) demonstrate nearly three-nines detection accuracy with a substantial speedup of nearly four orders of magnitude",

    "title": "Decoding Logic Errors: A Comparative Study on Bug Detection by Students and Large Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior -- in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students $(n=964)$ solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Batch Normalization (BN) has become an essential technique in contemporary neural network design, enhancing training stability. Specifically, BN employs centering and scaling operations to standardize features along the batch dimension and uses an affine transformation to recover features. Although standard BN has shown its capability to improve deep neural network training and convergence, it still exhibits inherent limitations in certain cases. Most existing techniques that enhance BN consider a single or a few aspects of BN. In this paper, we first identify problems with BN from a feature perspective and explore that feature condensation exists in the learning when employing BN, which negatively affects testing performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-stage unified framework called Unified Batch Normalization (UBN). In the first stage, we utilize a simple feature condensation threshold to alleviate the feature condensation, which hinders inappropriate statistic updates in normalization. In the second stage, we unify various normalization variants to boost each component of BN. Our experimental results reveal that UBN significantly enhances performance across different visual backbones and notably expedites network training convergence, particularly in early training stages. Notably, our method improved about 3% in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification with large batch sizes, showing the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios",

We achieve this by marrying image appearance and language understanding to generate a cognitive embedding, which not only activates prior information from large text-to-image diffusion models but also facilitates the generation of high-quality reference images to optimize the SR process. To further improve image fidelity, we propose a novel condition injection scheme called \"All-in-Attention\", consolidating all conditional information into a single module.

Deployed in voice processing front-ends and edge devices, these algorithms must ensure efficient real-time inference with low computational demands. Traditional edge-based noise suppression often uses MSE-based amplitude spectrum mask training, but this approach has limitations. We introduce a novel projection loss function, diverging from MSE, to enhance noise suppression. This method uses projection techniques to isolate key audio components from noise, significantly improving model performance. For echo cancellation, the function enables direct predictions on LAEC pre-processed outputs, substantially enhancing performance. Our noise suppression model achieves near state-of-the-art results with only 3.1M parameters and 0.4GFlops/s computational load.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized the design of the channel state information (CSI) feedback module in wireless communications. However, designing the optimal neural network (NN) architecture for CSI feedback can be a laborious and time-consuming process. Manual design can be prohibitively expensive for customizing NNs to different scenarios. This paper proposes using neural architecture search (NAS) to automate the generation of scenario-customized CSI feedback NN architectures, thereby maximizing the potential of deep learning in exclusive environments. By employing automated machine learning and gradient-descent-based NAS, an efficient and cost-effective architecture design process is achieved. The proposed approach leverages implicit scene knowledge, integrating it into the scenario customization process in a data-driven manner, and fully exploits the potential of deep learning for each specific scenario. To address the issue of excessive search, early stopping and elastic selection mechanisms are employed, enhancing the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the automatically generated architecture, known as Auto-CsiNet, outperforms manually-designed models in both reconstruction performance (achieving approximately a 14% improvement) and complexity (reducing it by approximately 50%). Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of the scenario on the NN architecture and its capacity",

We run our benchmark on three state-of-the-art chat-LLMs (GPT3.5, GPT4 and Llama2-chat) and show that these models make errors even with as few as three objects. Furthermore, they have quite heavy response biases, preferring certain responses irrespective of the question. Errors persist even with chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The optimization of traffic signal control (TSC) is critical for an efficient transportation system. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) techniques have emerged as a popular approach for TSC and show promising results for highly adaptive control. However, existing RL-based methods suffer from notably poor real-world applicability and hardly have any successful deployments. The reasons for such failures are mostly due to the reliance on over-idealized traffic simulators for policy optimization, as well as using unrealistic fine-grained state observations and reward signals that are not directly obtainable from real-world sensors. In this paper, we propose a fully Data-Driven and simulator-free framework for realistic Traffic Signal Control (D2TSC). Specifically, we combine well-established traffic flow theory with machine learning to construct a reward inference model to infer the reward signals from coarse-grained traffic data. With the inferred rewards, we further propose a sample-efficient offline RL method to enable direct signal control policy learning from historical offline datasets of real-world intersections. To evaluate our approach, we collect historical traffic data from a real-world intersection, and develop a highly customized simulation environment that strictly follows real data characteristics. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach achieves superior performance over conventional and offline RL baselines, and also enjoys much better real-world applicability",

FlowZero uses LLMs to understand complex spatio-temporal dynamics from text, where LLMs can generate a comprehensive dynamic scene syntax (DSS) containing scene descriptions, object layouts, and background motion patterns. These elements in DSS are then used to guide the image diffusion model for video generation with smooth object motions and frame-to-frame coherence. Moreover, FlowZero incorporates an iterative self-refinement process, enhancing the alignment between the spatio-temporal layouts and the textual prompts for the videos. To enhance global coherence, we propose enriching the initial noise of each frame with motion dynamics to control the background movement and camera motion adaptively.

    "abstract": "The use of pre-training is an emerging technique to enhance a neural model's performance, which has been shown to be effective for many neural language models such as BERT. This technique has also been used to enhance the performance of recommender systems. In such recommender systems, pre-training models are used to learn a better initialisation for both users and items. However, recent existing pre-trained recommender systems tend to only incorporate the user interaction data at the pre-training stage, making it difficult to deliver good recommendations, especially when the interaction data is sparse. To alleviate this common data sparsity issue, we propose to pre-train the recommendation model not only with the interaction data but also with other available information such as the social relations among users, thereby providing the recommender system with a better initialisation compared with solely relying on the user interaction data. We propose a novel recommendation model, the Social-aware Gaussian Pre-trained model (SGP), which encodes the user social relations and interaction data at the pre-training stage in a Graph Neural Network (GNN). Afterwards, in the subsequent fine-tuning stage, our SGP model adopts a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to factorise these pre-trained embeddings for further training, thereby benefiting the cold-start users from these pre-built social relations. Our extensive experiments on three public datasets show that, in comparison to 16 competitive baselines, our SGP model significantly outperforms the best baseline by upto 7.7% in terms of NDCG@10. In addition, we show that SGP permits to effectively alleviate the cold-start problem, especially when users newly register to the system through their friends' suggestions",

The framework encourages speaker embeddings to preserve phonetic information by matching the frame-based feature maps of a speaker embedding network with wav2vec's vectors. The intuition is that phonetic information can preserve low-level acoustic dynamics with speaker information and thus partly compensate for the degradation due to noise and reverberation. Results show that the proposed framework outperforms the standard speaker embedding on the VOiCES Challenge 2019 evaluation set and the VoxCeleb1 test set. This indicates that leveraging phonetic information under far-field conditions is effective for learning robust speaker representations",

    "title": "Align before Adapt: Leveraging Entity-to-Region Alignments for Generalizable Video Action Recognition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large-scale visual-language pre-trained models have achieved significant success in various video tasks. However, most existing methods follow an \"adapt then align\" paradigm, which adapts pre-trained image encoders to model video-level representations and utilizes one-hot or text embedding of the action labels for supervision. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of mapping from static images to complicated activity concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel \"Align before Adapt\" (ALT) paradigm. Prior to adapting to video representation learning, we exploit the entity-to-region alignments for each frame. The alignments are fulfilled by matching the region-aware image embeddings to an offline-constructed text corpus. With the aligned entities, we feed their text embeddings to a transformer-based video adapter as the queries, which can help extract the semantics of the most important entities from a video to a vector. This paradigm reuses the visual-language alignment of VLP during adaptation and tries to explain an action by the underlying entities. This helps understand actions by bridging the gap with complex activity semantics, particularly when facing unfamiliar or unseen categories. ALT achieves competitive performance and superior generalizability while requiring significantly low computational costs. In fully supervised scenarios, it achieves 88.1% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 with only 4947 GFLOPs. In 2-shot experiments, ALT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 7.1% and 9.2% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively",

    "title": "Spatially Covariant Image Registration with Text Prompts",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Medical images are often characterized by their structured anatomical representations and spatially inhomogeneous contrasts. Leveraging anatomical priors in neural networks can greatly enhance their utility in resource-constrained clinical settings. Prior research has harnessed such information for image segmentation, yet progress in deformable image registration has been modest. Our work introduces textSCF, a novel method that integrates spatially covariant filters and textual anatomical prompts encoded by visual-language models, to fill this gap. This approach optimizes an implicit function that correlates text embeddings of anatomical regions to filter weights, relaxing the typical translation-invariance constraint of convolutional operations. TextSCF not only boosts computational efficiency but can also retain or improve registration accuracy. By capturing the contextual interplay between anatomical regions, it offers impressive inter-regional transferability and the ability to preserve structural discontinuities during registration. TextSCF's performance has been rigorously tested on inter-subject brain MRI and abdominal CT registration tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models in the MICCAI Learn2Reg 2021 challenge and leading the leaderboard. In abdominal registrations, textSCF's larger model variant improved the Dice score by 11.3% over the second-best model, while its smaller variant maintained similar accuracy but with an 89.13% reduction in network parameters and a 98.34\\% decrease in computational operations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a multiagent based bi-level operation framework for the low-carbon demand management in distribution networks considering the carbon emission allowance on the demand side. In the upper level, the aggregate load agents optimize the control signals for various types of loads to maximize the profits; in the lower level, the distribution network operator makes optimal dispatching decisions to minimize the operational costs and calculates the distribution locational marginal price and carbon intensity. The distributed flexible load agent has only incomplete information of the distribution network and cooperates with other agents using networked communication. Finally, the problem is formulated into a networked multi-agent constrained Markov decision process, which is solved using a safe reinforcement learning algorithm called consensus multi-agent constrained policy optimization considering the carbon emission allowance for each agent. Case studies with the IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus distribution network systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in terms of satisfying the carbon emission constraint on demand side, ensuring the safe operation of the distribution network and preserving privacy of both sides",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable applicability across a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification. Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, the roles of vision and text prompts, as well as adapters in terms of generalization and transfer difficulty, have been overlooked, limiting performance on unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how VLMs behave when using vision and text prompts, adapters, and a combination of these components, marking a novel exploration by our study. Our observations find that utilizing vision prompts for class separability and text adapters for task adaptation is crucial for adaptability and generalizability. Moreover, to improve generalization across every domain, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that effectively combines the general knowledge of VLMs with task-specific knowledge according to transfer difficulty. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach",

    "abstract": "Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (TCGA-PathoText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues. Furthermore, WSI-text prediction can be seen as an approach of visual-language pre-training, which enables our model to be transferred to downstream diagnostic tasks like carcinoma grading and phenotyping. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping without adding extra parameters or tricky fine-tuning.

To evaluate, we release \\docmucow, a challenge set for translation disambiguation based on the English-German \\mucow \\cite{raganato-etal-2020-evaluation} augmented with document IDs.

It also aims to improve its performance and text generation quality for knowledge question-answering (QA) tasks. Based on the ChatGLM, we automatically generate QA datasets using urban renewal scientific literature corpora in a self-instruct manner and then conduct joint fine-tuning training on the model using the Prefix and LoRA fine-tuning methods to create an LLM for urban renewal. By guiding the LLM to automatically generate QA data based on prompt words and given text, it is possible to quickly obtain datasets in the urban renewal field and provide data support for the fine-tuning training of LLMs. The experimental results show that the joint fine-tuning training method proposed in this study can significantly improve the performance of LLM on the QA tasks. Compared with LoRA fine-tuning, the method improves the Bleu and Rouge metrics on the test by about 5%; compared with the model before fine-tuning, the method improves the Bleu and Rouge metrics by about 15%-20%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the joint fine-tuning method using Prefix and LoRA for ChatGLM in the urban renewal knowledge QA tasks.

Furthermore, while earlier approaches use interpretable classification layers, e.g. logistic regression in ProtoPNet, ProtoArgNet improves accuracy with multi-layer perceptrons while relying upon an interpretable reading thereof based on a form of argumentation. ProtoArgNet is customisable to user cognitive requirements by a process of sparsification of the multi-layer perceptron/argumentation component. Also, as opposed to other prototypical-part-learning approaches, ProtoArgNet can recognise spatial relations between different prototypical-parts that are from different regions in images, similar to how CNNs capture relations between patterns recognized in earlier layers",

Handcrafting high-efficiency schedules can be challenging due to the large and varying schedule space. This paper presents Tessel, an automated system that searches for efficient schedules for distributed DNN training and inference for diverse operator placement strategies. To reduce search costs, Tessel leverages the insight that the most efficient schedules often exhibit repetitive pattern (repetend) across different data inputs. This leads to a two-phase approach: repetend construction and schedule completion. By exploring schedules for various operator placement strategies, Tessel significantly improves both training and inference performance. Experiments with representative DNN models demonstrate that Tessel achieves up to 5.5x training performance speedup and up to 38% inference latency reduction",

    "title": "IA-LSTM: Interaction-Aware LSTM for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Predicting the trajectory of pedestrians in crowd scenarios is indispensable in self-driving or autonomous mobile robot field because estimating the future locations of pedestrians around is beneficial for policy decision to avoid collision. It is a challenging issue because humans have different walking motions and the interactions between humans and objects in the current environment, especially between human themselves, are complex. Previous researches have focused on how to model the human-human interactions, however, neglecting the relative importance of interactions. In order to address this issue, we introduce a novel mechanism based on the correntropy, which not only can measure the relative importance of human-human interactions, but also can build personal space for each pedestrian. We further propose an Interaction Module including this data-driven mechanism that can effectively extract feature representations of dynamic human-human interactions in the scene and calculate corresponding weights to represent the importance of different interactions. To share such social messages among pedestrians, we design an interaction-aware architecture based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for trajectory prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our model on two public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than several latest methods with good performance",

    "title": "Domain Knowledge Injection in Bayesian Search for New Materials",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper we propose DKIBO, a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm that accommodates domain knowledge to tune exploration in the search space. Bayesian optimization has recently emerged as a sample-efficient optimizer for many intractable scientific problems. While various existing BO frameworks allow the input of prior beliefs to accelerate the search by narrowing down the space, incorporating such knowledge is not always straightforward and can often introduce bias and lead to poor performance. Here we propose a simple approach to incorporate structural knowledge in the acquisition function by utilizing an additional deterministic surrogate model to enrich the approximation power of the Gaussian process. This is suitably chosen according to structural information of the problem at hand and acts a corrective term towards a better-informed sampling. We empirically demonstrate the practical utility of the proposed method by successfully injecting domain knowledge in a materials design task. We further validate our method's performance on different experimental settings and ablation analyses",

    "title": "Leveraging Diffusion Perturbations for Measuring Fairness in Computer Vision",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computer vision models have been known to encode harmful biases, leading to the potentially unfair treatment of historically marginalized groups, such as people of color. However, there remains a lack of datasets balanced along demographic traits that can be used to evaluate the downstream fairness of these models. In this work, we demonstrate that diffusion models can be leveraged to create such a dataset. We first use a diffusion model to generate a large set of images depicting various occupations. Subsequently, each image is edited using inpainting to generate multiple variants, where each variant refers to a different perceived race. Using this dataset, we benchmark several vision-language models on a multi-class occupation classification task. We find that images generated with non-Caucasian labels have a significantly higher occupation misclassification rate than images generated with Caucasian labels, and that several misclassifications are suggestive of racial biases. We measure a model's downstream fairness by computing the standard deviation in the probability of predicting the true occupation label across the different perceived identity groups. Using this fairness metric, we find significant disparities between the evaluated vision-and-language models. We hope that our work demonstrates the potential value of diffusion methods for fairness evaluations",

    "title": "Introducing SSBD+ Dataset with a Convolutional Pipeline for detecting Self-Stimulatory Behaviours in Children using raw videos",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Conventionally, evaluation for the diagnosis of Autism spectrum disorder is done by a trained specialist through questionnaire-based formal assessments and by observation of behavioral cues under various settings to capture the early warning signs of autism. These evaluation techniques are highly subjective and their accuracy relies on the experience of the specialist. In this regard, machine learning-based methods for automated capturing of early signs of autism from the recorded videos of the children is a promising alternative. In this paper, the authors propose a novel pipelined deep learning architecture to detect certain self-stimulatory behaviors that help in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The authors also supplement their tool with an augmented version of the Self Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD) and also propose a new label in SSBD Action detection: no-class. The deep learning model with the new dataset is made freely available for easy adoption to the researchers and developers community. An overall accuracy of around 81% was achieved from the proposed pipeline model that is targeted for real-time and hands-free automated diagnosis.

    "title": "Word for Person: Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Searching for specific person has great security value and social benefits, and it often involves a combination of visual and textual information. Conventional person retrieval methods, whether image-based or text-based, usually fall short in effectively harnessing both types of information, leading to the loss of accuracy. In this paper, a whole new task called Composed Person Retrieval (CPR) is proposed to jointly utilize both image and text information for target person retrieval. However, the supervised CPR must depend on very costly manual annotation dataset, while there are currently no available resources. To mitigate this issue, we firstly introduce the Zero-shot Composed Person Retrieval (ZS-CPR), which leverages existing domain-related data to resolve the CPR problem without reliance on expensive annotations. Secondly, to learn ZS-CPR model, we propose a two-stage learning framework, Word4Per, where a lightweight Textual Inversion Network (TINet) and a text-based person retrieval model based on fine-tuned Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) network are learned without utilizing any CPR data. Thirdly, a finely annotated Image-Text Composed Person Retrieval dataset (ITCPR) is built as the benchmark to assess the performance of the proposed Word4Per framework. Extensive experiments under both Rank-1 and mAP demonstrate the effectiveness of Word4Per for the ZS-CPR task, surpassing the comparative methods by over 10%. The code and ITCPR dataset will be publicly available at https://github.com/Delong-liu-bupt/Word4Per",

In this paper, we propose a novel emotion correlation enhanced empathetic dialogue generation framework, which comprehensively realizes emotion correlation learning, utilization, and supervising. Specifically, a multi-resolution emotion graph is devised to capture context-based emotion interactions from different resolutions, further modeling emotion correlation.

    "abstract": "This paper provides an efficient training-free painterly image harmonization (PIH) method, dubbed FreePIH, that leverages only a pre-trained diffusion model to achieve state-of-the-art harmonization results. Unlike existing methods that require either training auxiliary networks or fine-tuning a large pre-trained backbone, or both, to harmonize a foreground object with a painterly-style background image, our FreePIH tames the denoising process as a plug-in module for foreground image style transfer. Specifically, we find that the very last few steps of the denoising (i.e., generation) process strongly correspond to the stylistic information of images, and based on this, we propose to augment the latent features of both the foreground and background images with Gaussians for a direct denoising-based harmonization. To guarantee the fidelity of the harmonized image, we make use of multi-scale features to enforce the consistency of the content and stability of the foreground objects in the latent space, and meanwhile, aligning both fore-/back-grounds with the same style. Moreover, to accommodate the generation with more structural and textural details, we further integrate text prompts to attend to the latent features, hence improving the generation quality.

MLA-PLM adopts structural and semantic pre-training (SSP) to implement global relationship modeling, and point matching pre-training (PMP) to achieve alignment between visual points and textual points. LA-FA employs a layout-aware attention mask to realize point-guided cross-modal fusion for further boosting layout awareness of LANS.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models have been widely used in image segmentation, by generating segmentation masks conditioned on the input image. However, previous works can not seamlessly integrate existing end-to-end models with denoising diffusion models. Existing research can only select acceleration steps based on experience rather than calculating them specifically. Moreover, most methods are limited to small models and small-scale datasets, unable to generalize to general datasets and a wider range of tasks. Therefore, we propose Resfusion with a novel resnoise-diffusion process, which gradually generates segmentation masks or any type of target image, seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models. Resfusion bridges the discrepancy between the likelihood output and the ground truth output through a Markov process. Through the novel smooth equivalence transformation in resnoise-diffusion process, we determine the optimal acceleration step. Experimental results demonstrate that Resfusion combines the capabilities of existing end-to-end models and denoising diffusion models, further enhancing performance and achieving outstanding results. Moreover, Resfusion is not limited to segmentation tasks, it can easily generalize to any general tasks of image generation and exhibit strong competitiveness",

We investigate emotion corpora with varying emotion categorical scopes to determine the best corpus scope for supplying emotion knowledge to foster generalized hate speech detection. We further assess the relationship between using pretrained Transformers models adapted for hate speech and its effect on our emotion-enriched hate speech generalization model. We perform extensive experiments on six publicly available datasets sourced from different online domains and show that our emotion-enriched HS detection generalization method demonstrates consistent generalization improvement in cross-domain evaluation, increasing generalization performance up to 18.1% and average cross-domain performance up to 8.5%, according to the F1 measure",

Approximately 1,3 million people lose their lives daily due to traffic accidents [World Health Organization, 2022].

The integration of Artificial Intelligence algorithms, leveraging machine learning and computer vision, has facilitated the development of precise traffic rule enforcement. This paper illustrates how computer vision and machine learning enable the creation of robust algorithms for detecting various traffic violations. Our model, capable of identifying six common traffic infractions, detects red light violations, illegal use of breakdown lanes, violations of vehicle following distance, breaches of marked crosswalk laws, illegal parking, and parking on marked crosswalks. Utilizing online traffic footage and a self-mounted on-dash camera, we apply the YOLOv5 algorithm's detection module to identify traffic agents such as cars, pedestrians, and traffic signs, and the strongSORT algorithm for continuous interframe tracking. Six discrete algorithms analyze agents' behavior and trajectory to detect violations. Subsequently, an Identification Module extracts vehicle ID information, such as the license plate, to generate violation notices sent to relevant authorities",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in natural image domains, allowing users to hold a dialogue about given visual content. However, such general-domain VLMs perform poorly for Remote Sensing (RS) scenarios, leading to inaccurate or fabricated information when presented with RS domain-specific queries. Such a behavior emerges due to the unique challenges introduced by RS imagery. For example, to handle high-resolution RS imagery with diverse scale changes across categories and many small objects, region-level reasoning is necessary alongside holistic scene interpretation. Furthermore, the lack of domain-specific multimodal instruction following data as well as strong backbone models for RS make it hard for the models to align their behavior with user queries. To address these limitations, we propose GeoChat - the first versatile remote sensing VLM that offers multitask conversational capabilities with high-resolution RS images. Specifically, GeoChat can not only answer image-level queries but also accepts region inputs to hold region-specific dialogue. Furthermore, it can visually ground objects in its responses by referring to their spatial coordinates. To address the lack of domain-specific datasets, we generate a novel RS multimodal instruction-following dataset by extending image-text pairs from existing diverse RS datasets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for RS multitask conversations and compare with a number of baseline methods. GeoChat demonstrates robust zero-shot performance on various RS tasks, e.g., image and region captioning, visual question answering, scene classification, visually grounded conversations and referring detection.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Historically applied exclusively to perfect information games, depth-limited search with value functions has been key to recent advances in AI for imperfect information games. Most prominent approaches with strong theoretical guarantees require subgame decomposition - a process in which a subgame is computed from public information and player beliefs. However, subgame decomposition can itself require non-trivial computations, and its tractability depends on the existence of efficient algorithms for either full enumeration or generation of the histories that form the root of the subgame. Despite this, no formal analysis of the tractability of such computations has been established in prior work, and application domains have often consisted of games, such as poker, for which enumeration is trivial on modern hardware. Applying these ideas to more complex domains requires understanding their cost. In this work, we introduce and analyze the computational aspects and tractability of filtering histories for subgame decomposition. We show that constructing a single history from the root of the subgame is generally intractable, and then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for efficient enumeration. We also introduce a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based generation algorithm for trick-taking card games - a domain where enumeration is often prohibitively expensive. Our experiments demonstrate its improved scalability in the trick-taking card game Oh Hell. These contributions clarify when and how depth-limited search via subgame decomposition can be an effective tool for sequential decision-making in imperfect information settings",

    "abstract": "Recent language models have a mysterious tendency to generate false but plausible-sounding text. Such \"hallucinations\" are an obstacle to the usability of language-based AI systems and can harm people who rely upon their outputs. This work shows shows that there is an inherent statistical reason that pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having nothing to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For \"arbitrary\" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models. Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a \"Good-Turing\" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors. One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors (i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the type of arbitrary facts that tend to appear once in the training set. However, our analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the training data (like references to publications such as articles and books, whose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on systematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different architectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of hallucinations",

Although these vision-based models have shown promising results, they face limitations in effectively capturing and utilizing the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions between the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements, crucial for accurate reasoning. Additionally, training these models requires manually annotating domain-specific datasets, a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to generalize to new environments and scenarios. The recent emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers potential solutions to these limitations due to their superior visual understanding and causal reasoning capabilities, which can be harnessed through semi-supervised training. GPT-4V(ision), the latest iteration of the state-of-the-art Large-Language Model GPTs, now incorporates vision input capabilities. This report provides a comprehensive evaluation of the potential of GPT-4V for pedestrian behavior prediction in autonomous driving using publicly available datasets: JAAD, PIE, and WiDEVIEW. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate GPT-4V(ision)'s promise in zero-shot pedestrian behavior prediction and driving scene understanding ability for autonomous driving. However, it still falls short of the state-of-the-art traditional domain-specific models. Challenges include difficulties in handling small pedestrians and vehicles in motion.

The end-to-end method performed significantly better than the fixed-feature method, achieving 0.928 (0.035 SD) Macro F1 compared to the fixed-feature method's 0.701 (0.052 SD). Because of the nature of the experiment, these figures are a lower bound and can be improved further.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative training paradigm that allows for privacy-preserving learning of cross-institutional models by eliminating the exchange of sensitive data and instead relying on the exchange of model parameters between the clients and a server. Despite individual studies on how client models are aggregated, and, more recently, on the benefits of ImageNet pre-training, there is a lack of understanding of the effect the architecture chosen for the federation has, and of how the aforementioned elements interconnect. To this end, we conduct the first joint ARchitecture-Initialization-Aggregation study and benchmark ARIAs across a range of medical image classification tasks. We find that, contrary to current practices, ARIA elements have to be chosen together to achieve the best possible performance. Our results also shed light on good choices for each element depending on the task, the effect of normalisation layers, and the utility of SSL pre-training, pointing to potential directions for designing FL-specific architectures and training pipelines",

    "title": "Eliciting Honest Information From Authors Using Sequential Review",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the setting of conference peer review, the conference aims to accept high-quality papers and reject low-quality papers based on noisy review scores. A recent work proposes the isotonic mechanism, which can elicit the ranking of paper qualities from an author with multiple submissions to help improve the conference's decisions. However, the isotonic mechanism relies on the assumption that the author's utility is both an increasing and a convex function with respect to the review score, which is often violated in peer review settings (e.g.~when authors aim to maximize the number of accepted papers). In this paper, we propose a sequential review mechanism that can truthfully elicit the ranking information from authors while only assuming the agent's utility is increasing with respect to the true quality of her accepted papers. The key idea is to review the papers of an author in a sequence based on the provided ranking and conditioning the review of the next paper on the review scores of the previous papers. Advantages of the sequential review mechanism include 1) eliciting truthful ranking information in a more realistic setting than prior work; 2) improving the quality of accepted papers, reducing the reviewing workload and increasing the average quality of papers being reviewed; 3) incentivizing authors to write fewer papers of higher quality",

    "abstract": "There are many combinatorial optimization problems whose solutions are best represented by permutations. The classic traveling salesperson seeks an optimal ordering over a set of cities. Scheduling problems often seek optimal orderings of tasks or activities. Although some evolutionary approaches to such problems utilize the bit strings of a genetic algorithm, it is more common to directly represent solutions with permutations. Evolving permutations directly requires specialized evolutionary operators. Over the years, many crossover and mutation operators have been developed for solving permutation problems with evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we survey the breadth of evolutionary operators for permutations. We implemented all of these in Chips-n-Salsa, an open source Java library for evolutionary computation.

    "title": "GPT Struct Me: Probing GPT Models on Narrative Entity Extraction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The importance of systems that can extract structured information from textual data becomes increasingly pronounced given the ever-increasing volume of text produced on a daily basis. Having a system that can effectively extract such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can, to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field",

    "title": "Counting Solutions to Conjunctive Queries: Structural and Hybrid Tractability",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Counting the number of answers to conjunctive queries is a fundamental problem in databases that, under standard assumptions, does not have an efficient solution. The issue is inherently #P-hard, extending even to classes of acyclic instances. To address this, we pinpoint tractable classes by examining the structural properties of instances and introducing the novel concept of #-hypertree decomposition. We establish the feasibility of counting answers in polynomial time for classes of queries featuring bounded #-hypertree width. Additionally, employing novel techniques from the realm of fixed-parameter computational complexity, we prove that, for bounded arity queries, the bounded #-hypertree width property precisely delineates the frontier of tractability for the counting problem. This result closes an important gap in our understanding of the complexity of such a basic problem for conjunctive queries and, equivalently, for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Drawing upon #-hypertree decompositions, a ''hybrid'' decomposition method emerges. This approach leverages both the structural characteristics of the query and properties intrinsic to the input database, including keys or other (weaker) degree constraints that limit the permissible combinations of values. Intuitively, these features may introduce distinct structural properties that elude identification through the ''worst-possible database'' perspective inherent in purely structural methods",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI into radiology introduces opportunities for improved clinical care provision and efficiency but it demands a meticulous approach to mitigate potential risks as with any other new technology. Beginning with rigorous pre-deployment evaluation and validation, the focus should be on ensuring models meet the highest standards of safety, effectiveness and efficacy for their intended applications. Input and output guardrails implemented during production usage act as an additional layer of protection, identifying and addressing individual failures as they occur. Continuous post-deployment monitoring allows for tracking population-level performance (data drift), fairness, and value delivery over time. Scheduling reviews of post-deployment model performance and educating radiologists about new algorithmic-driven findings is critical for AI to be effective in clinical practice. Recognizing that no single AI solution can provide absolute assurance even when limited to its intended use, the synergistic application of quality assurance at multiple levels - regulatory, clinical, technical, and ethical - is emphasized. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders spanning healthcare systems, industry, academia, and government are imperative to address the multifaceted challenges involved. Trust in AI is an earned privilege, contingent on a broad set of goals, among them transparently demonstrating that the AI adheres to the same rigorous safety, effectiveness and efficacy standards as other established medical technologies. By doing so, developers can instil confidence among providers and patients alike, enabling the responsible scaling of AI and the realization of its potential benefits.

    "abstract": "The rise of renewables coincides with the shift towards Electrical Vehicles (EVs) posing technical and operational challenges for the energy balance of the local grid. Nowadays, the energy grid cannot deal with a spike in EVs usage leading to a need for more coordinated and grid aware EVs charging and discharging strategies. However, coordinating power flow from multiple EVs into the grid requires sophisticated algorithms and load-balancing strategies as the complexity increases with more control variables and EVs, necessitating large optimization and decision search spaces. In this paper, we propose an EVs fleet coordination model for the day ahead aiming to ensure a reliable energy supply and maintain a stable local grid, by utilizing EVs to store surplus energy and discharge it during periods of energy deficit. The optimization problem is addressed using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) considering criteria related to energy grid balancing, time usage preference, and the location of EV drivers. The EVs schedules, associated with the position of individuals from the population, are adjusted through exploration and exploitation operations, and their technical and operational feasibility is ensured, while the rabbit individual is updated with a non-dominated EV schedule selected per iteration using a roulette wheel algorithm. The solution is evaluated within the framework of an e-mobility service in Terni city. The results indicate that coordinated charging and discharging of EVs not only meet balancing service requirements but also align with user preferences with minimal deviations",

    "abstract": "Replicating the innate human ability to detect all objects based on free-form texts at any granularity remains a formidable challenge for Vision-Language models. Current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are predominantly constrained to grounding a single, pre-existing object, relying solely on data from Referring Expression Comprehension tasks. The limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or the integration of customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research delves into the untapped potential of LVLMs and uncover their inherent capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel language-prompted localization dataset designed to fully unleash the capabilities of LVLMs in integrating fine-grained object perception with precise location awareness. More importantly, we present $\\textbf{Griffon}$, a purely LVLM-based baseline, which does not require the introduction of any special tokens, expert models, or additional detection modules. It simply maintains a consistent structure with popular LVLMs by unifying data formats across various localization-related scenarios and is trained end-to-end through a well-designed pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{Griffon}$ not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained RefCOCO series but also approaches the capabilities of the expert model Faster RCNN on the detection benchmark MSCOCO",

In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages text-derived statistics to predict the mean and covariance of the visual feature distribution for each class. This predictive framework enriches the latent space, yielding more robust and generalizable few-shot learning models. We demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both mean and covariance statistics in improving few-shot classification performance across various datasets. Our method shows that we can use text to predict the mean and covariance of the distribution offering promising improvements in few-shot learning scenarios",

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference signals that are in the form of ranking of response pairs to perform this alignment. However, human preference on LLM outputs can come in much richer forms including natural language, which may provide detailed feedback on strengths and weaknesses of a given response. In this work we investigate data efficiency of modeling human feedback that is in natural language. Specifically, we fine-tune an open-source LLM, e.g., Falcon-40B-Instruct, on a relatively small amount (1000 records or even less) of human feedback in natural language in the form of critiques and revisions of responses. We show that this model is able to improve the quality of responses from even some of the strongest LLMs such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Vicuna, through critique and revision of those responses. For instance, through one iteration of revision of ChatGPT responses, the revised responses have 56.6% win rate over the original ones, and this win rate can be further improved to 65.9% after applying the revision for five iterations",

This variety presents a major challenge in discussing and integrating streaming solutions, due to the lack of a common language. This work attempts to address this critical research gap, by systematizing RDF stream types present in the literature in a novel taxonomy. The proposed RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX) is embodied in an OWL 2 DL ontology that follows the FAIR principles, making it readily applicable in practice. Extensive documentation and additional resources are provided, to foster the adoption of the ontology. Two realized use cases are presented, demonstrating the usefulness of the resource in discussing research works and annotating streaming datasets. Another result of this contribution is the novel nanopublications dataset, which serves as a collaborative, living state-of-the-art review of RDF streaming. The aim of RDF-STaX is to address a real need of the community for a better way to systematize and describe RDF streams. The resource is designed to help drive innovation in RDF streaming, by fostering scientific discussion, cooperation, and tool interoperability",

    "abstract": "Medical dialogue generation relies on natural language generation techniques to enable online medical consultations. Recently, the widespread adoption of large-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated rapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are mostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of high-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes CMed-GPT, which is the GPT pre-training language model based on Chinese medical domain text. The model is available in two versions, namely, base and large, with corresponding perplexity values of 8.64 and 8.01. Additionally, we incorporate lexical and entity embeddings into the dialogue text in a uniform manner to meet the requirements of downstream dialogue generation tasks. By applying both fine-tuning and p-tuning to CMed-GPT, we lowered the PPL from 8.44 to 7.35. This study not only confirms the exceptional performance of the CMed-GPT model in generating Chinese biomedical text but also highlights the advantages of p-tuning over traditional fine-tuning with prefix prompts. Furthermore, we validate the significance of incorporating external information in medical dialogue generation, which enhances the quality of dialogue generation",

In addition to these, the current intelligent mechanisms cannot perform well due to the spatiotemporal changes in the implemented IoT network scenario. To handle these challenges, we propose a DT-native AI-driven service architecture in support of the concept of IoT networks. Within the proposed DT-native architecture, we implement a TCP-based data flow pipeline and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based learner model. We apply the proposed architecture to one of the broad concepts of IoT networks, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). We measure the efficiency of our proposed architecture and note ~30% processing time-saving thanks to the TCP-based data flow pipeline.

    "abstract": "With the evolution of blockchain technology, the issue of transaction security, particularly on platforms like Ethereum, has become increasingly critical. Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose significant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these attack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities, then strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures their transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included in the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a comprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running attacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter each type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method named FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary Classification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions within decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate classification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement, insertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting front-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%",

While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has gradually shown its latent decision-making ability in urban rail transit autonomous operation. However, since reinforcement learning can not neither guarantee safety during learning nor execution, this is still one of the major obstacles to the practical application of reinforcement learning. Given this drawback, reinforcement learning applied in the safety-critical autonomous operation domain remains challenging without generating a safe control command sequence that avoids overspeed operations. Therefore, a SSA-DRL framework is proposed in this paper for safe intelligent control of urban rail transit autonomous operation trains. The proposed framework is combined with linear temporal logic, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search and consists of four mainly module: a post-posed shielding, a searching tree module, a DRL framework and an additional actor. Furthermore, the output of the framework can meet speed constraint, schedule constraint and optimize the operation process. Finally, the proposed SSA-DRL framework for decision-making in urban rail transit autonomous operation is evaluated in sixteen different sections, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through an ablation experiment and comparison with the scheduled operation plan",

Yet, the expert evaluation of motion abnormalities with CMRI is a challenging task. To automatically assess cardiac motion, we register CMRIs from different time points of the cardiac cycle using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and perform a biomechanically informed regularization inspired by the myocardial incompressibility assumption. To enhance the registration performance, our method first rectifies the inter-slice misalignment inherent to CMRI by performing a rigid registration guided by the long-axis views, and then increases the through-plane resolution using an unsupervised deep learning super-resolution approach. Finally, we propose to synergically combine information from short-axis and 4-chamber long-axis views, along with an initialization to incorporate information from multiple cardiac time points. Thereafter, to quantify cardiac motion, we calculate global and segmental strain over a cardiac cycle and compute the peak strain. The evaluation of the method is performed on a dataset of cine CMRI scans from 47 ARVC patients and 67 controls. Our results show that inter-slice alignment and generation of super-resolved volumes combined with joint analysis of the two cardiac views, notably improves registration performance. Furthermore, the proposed initialization yields more physiologically plausible registrations. The significant differences in the peak strain, discerned between the ARVC patients and healthy controls suggest that automated motion quantification methods may assist in diagnosis and provide further understanding of disease-specific alterations of cardiac motion",

    "title": "GCPV: Guided Concept Projection Vectors for the Explainable Inspection of CNN Feature Spaces",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For debugging and verification of computer vision convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) human inspection of the learned latent representations is imperative. Therefore, state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods globally associate given natural language semantic concepts with representing vectors or regions in the CNN latent space supporting manual inspection. Yet, this approach comes with two major disadvantages: They are locally inaccurate when reconstructing a concept label and discard information about the distribution of concept instance representations. The latter, though, is of particular interest for debugging, like finding and understanding outliers, learned notions of sub-concepts, and concept confusion. Furthermore, current single-layer approaches neglect that information about a concept may be spread over the CNN depth. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the local-to-global Guided Concept Projection Vectors (GCPV) approach: It (1) generates local concept vectors that each precisely reconstruct a concept segmentation label, and then (2) generalizes these to global concept and even sub-concept vectors by means of hiearchical clustering. Our experiments on object detectors demonstrate improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art, the benefit of multi-layer concept vectors, and robustness against low-quality concept segmentation labels. Finally, we demonstrate that GCPVs can be applied to find root causes for confusion of concepts like bus and truck, and reveal interesting concept-level outliers. Thus, GCPVs pose a promising step towards interpretable model debugging and informed data improvement",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Odor sensory evaluation has a broad application in food, clothing, cosmetics, and other fields. Traditional artificial sensory evaluation has poor repeatability, and the machine olfaction represented by the electronic nose (E-nose) is difficult to reflect human feelings. Olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG) contains odor and individual features associated with human olfactory preference, which has unique advantages in odor sensory evaluation. However, the difficulty of cross-subject olfactory EEG recognition greatly limits its application. It is worth noting that E-nose and olfactory EEG are more advantageous in representing odor information and individual emotions, respectively. In this paper, an E-nose and olfactory EEG multimodal learning method is proposed for cross-subject olfactory preference recognition. Firstly, the olfactory EEG and E-nose multimodal data acquisition and preprocessing paradigms are established. Secondly, a complementary multimodal data mining strategy is proposed to effectively mine the common features of multimodal data representing odor information and the individual features in olfactory EEG representing individual emotional information. Finally, the cross-subject olfactory preference recognition is achieved in 24 subjects by fusing the extracted common and individual features, and the recognition effect is superior to the state-of-the-art recognition methods. Furthermore, the advantages of the proposed method in cross-subject olfactory preference recognition indicate its potential for practical odor evaluation applications",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, as a type of generative models, have achieved impressive results in generating images and videos conditioned on textual conditions. However, the generation process of diffusion models involves denoising for dozens of steps to produce photorealistic images/videos, which is computationally expensive. Unlike previous methods that design ``one-size-fits-all'' approaches for speed up, we argue denoising steps should be sample-specific conditioned on the richness of input texts. To this end, we introduce AdaDiff, a lightweight framework designed to learn instance-specific step usage policies, which are then used by the diffusion model for generation. AdaDiff is optimized using a policy gradient method to maximize a carefully designed reward function, balancing inference time and generation quality. We conduct experiments on three image generation and two video generation benchmarks and demonstrate that our approach achieves similar results in terms of visual quality compared to the baseline using a fixed 50 denoising steps while reducing inference time by at least 33%, going as high as 40%. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis shows that our method allocates more steps to more informative text conditions and fewer steps to simpler text conditions",

    "abstract": "In the age of technology, data is an increasingly important resource. This importance is growing in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where sub fields such as Machine Learning (ML) need more and more data to achieve better results. Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of sensors and smart objects to collect and exchange data, in addition to achieving many other tasks. A huge amount of the resource desired, data, is stored in mobile devices, sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but remains there due to data protection restrictions. At the same time these devices do not have enough data or computational capacity to train good models. Moreover, transmitting, storing and processing all this data on a centralised server is problematic. Federated Learning (FL) provides an innovative solution that allows devices to learn in a collaborative way. More importantly, it accomplishes this without violating data protection laws. FL is currently growing, and there are several solutions that implement it. This article presents a prototype of a FL solution where the IoT devices used were raspberry pi boards. The results compare the performance of a solution of this type with those obtained in traditional approaches. In addition, the FL solution performance was tested in a hostile environment. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a image data set were used. The results show the feasibility and usability of these techniques, although in many cases they do not reach the performance of traditional approaches",

In this scoping review, we clarify the ways in which biases related to GAI in higher education settings have been discussed in recent academic publications and identify what type of potential biases are commonly reported in this body of literature. We searched for academic articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases concerned with GAI usage in higher education and bias. Our findings show that while there is an awareness of potential biases around large language models (LLMs) and GAI, the majority of articles touch on ``bias'' at a relatively superficial level. Few identify what types of bias may occur under what circumstances. Neither do they discuss the possible implications for the higher education, staff, faculty members, or students. There is a notable lack of empirical work at this point, and we call for higher education researchers and AI experts to conduct more research in this area",

    "abstract": "Wind speed prediction is critical to the management of wind power generation. Due to the large range of wind speed fluctuations and wake effect, there may also be strong correlations between long-distance wind turbines. This difficult-to-extract feature has become a bottleneck for improving accuracy. History and future time information includes the trend of airflow changes, whether this dynamic information can be utilized will also affect the prediction effect. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes Windformer. First, Windformer divides the wind turbine cluster into multiple non-overlapping windows and calculates correlations inside the windows, then shifts the windows partially to provide connectivity between windows, and finally fuses multi-channel features based on detailed and global information. To dynamically model the change process of wind speed, this paper extracts time series in both history and future directions simultaneously. Compared with other current-advanced methods, the Mean Square Error (MSE) of Windformer is reduced by 0.5\\% to 15\\% on two datasets from NERL",

    "title": "Robust Domain Misinformation Detection via Multi-modal Feature Alignment",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher \"credibility\" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting and sample inefficiency making it less applicable to the ever-changing real world. However, the ability to use previously learned knowledge is essential for AI agents to quickly adapt to novelties. Often, certain spatial information observed by the agent in the previous interactions can be leveraged to infer task-specific rules. Inferred rules can then help the agent to avoid potentially dangerous situations in the previously unseen states and guide the learning process increasing agent's novelty adaptation speed. In this work, we propose a general framework that is applicable to deep reinforcement learning agents. Our framework provides the agent with an autonomous way to discover the task-specific rules in the novel environments and self-supervise it's learning. We provide a rule-driven deep Q-learning agent (RDQ) as one possible implementation of that framework. We show that RDQ successfully extracts task-specific rules as it interacts with the world and uses them to drastically increase its learning efficiency. In our experiments, we show that the RDQ agent is significantly more resilient to the novelties than the baseline agents, and is able to detect and adapt to novel situations faster",

    "abstract": "The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic is a defining health crisis. Recent efforts have been increasingly directed towards achieving quick and accurate detection of COVID-19 across symptomatic patients to mitigate the intensity and spread of the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to chest X-ray (CXR) images have emerged as promising diagnostic tools, and previous work has demonstrated impressive classification performances. However, such methods have faced criticisms from physicians due to their black-box reasoning process and unpredictable nature. In contrast to professional radiologist diagnosis, AI systems often lack generalizability, explainability, and robustness in the clinical decision making process. In our work, we address these issues by first proposing an extensive baseline study, training and evaluating 21 convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a diverse set of 33,000+ CXR images to classify between healthy, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs. Our resulting models achieved a 3-way classification accuracy, recall, and precision of up to 97.03\\%, 97.97\\%, and 99.95\\%, respectively. Next, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training on model robustness and explainability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps. We find that adversarially trained models not only significantly outperform their standard counterparts on classifying perturbed images, but also yield saliency maps that 1) better specify clinically relevant features, 2) are robust against extraneous artifacts, and 3) agree considerably more with expert radiologist findings",

    "abstract": "Accelerated stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is a workhorse in deep learning and often achieves better generalization performance than SGD. However, existing optimization theory can only explain the faster convergence of ASGD, but cannot explain its better generalization. In this paper, we study the generalization of ASGD for overparameterized linear regression, which is possibly the simplest setting of learning with overparameterization. We establish an instance-dependent excess risk bound for ASGD within each eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Our analysis shows that (i) ASGD outperforms SGD in the subspace of small eigenvalues, exhibiting a faster rate of exponential decay for bias error, while in the subspace of large eigenvalues, its bias error decays slower than SGD; and (ii) the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD. Our result suggests that ASGD can outperform SGD when the difference between the initialization and the true weight vector is mostly confined to the subspace of small eigenvalues. Additionally, when our analysis is specialized to linear regression in the strongly convex setting, it yields a tighter bound for bias error than the best-known result",

    "abstract": "Data science projects often involve various machine learning (ML) methods that depend on data, code, and models. One of the key activities in these projects is the selection of a model or algorithm that is appropriate for the data analysis at hand. ML model selection depends on several factors, which include data-related attributes such as sample size, functional requirements such as the prediction algorithm type, and non-functional requirements such as performance and bias. However, the factors that influence such selection are often not well understood and explicitly represented. This paper describes ongoing work on extending an adaptive variability-aware model selection method with bias detection in ML projects. The method involves: (i) modeling the variability of the factors that affect model selection using feature models based on heuristics proposed in the literature; (ii) instantiating our variability model with added features related to bias (e.g., bias-related metrics); and (iii) conducting experiments that illustrate the method in a specific case study to illustrate our approach based on a heart failure prediction project. The proposed approach aims to advance the state of the art by making explicit factors that influence model selection, particularly those related to bias, as well as their interactions. The provided representations can transform model selection in ML projects into a non ad hoc, adaptive, and explainable process",

We then fine-tune BERT models on each of the five resulting datasets and evaluate model performance on a holdout portion of each condition. We find considerable differences between the conditions for 1) the share of hate speech/offensive language annotations, 2) model performance, 3) model predictions, and 4) model learning curves.

    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common and challenging condition to diagnose accurately. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods for mTBI often have limitations in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance mTBI diagnosis using 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images and a metric learning technique trained with triplet loss. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (RTCNN) model to distinguish between mTBI cases and healthy ones by embedding 3D CT scans into a feature space. The triplet loss function maximizes the margin between similar and dissimilar image pairs, optimizing feature representations. This facilitates better context placement of individual cases, aids informed decision-making, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Our RTCNN model shows promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, achieving an average accuracy of 94.3%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%, as confirmed through a five-fold cross-validation. Importantly, when compared to the conventional Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the RTCNN exhibits a significant improvement, showcasing a remarkable 22.5% increase in specificity, a notable 16.2% boost in accuracy, and an 11.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Moreover, RTCNN requires lower memory resources, making it not only highly effective but also resource-efficient in minimizing false positives while maximizing its diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal CT scans from mTBI cases. The quantitative performance metrics provided and utilization of occlusion sensitivity maps to visually explain the model's decision-making process further enhance the interpretability and transparency of our approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Common regularization algorithms for linear regression, such as LASSO and Ridge regression, rely on a regularization hyperparameter that balances the tradeoff between minimizing the fitting error and the norm of the learned model coefficients. As this hyperparameter is scalar, it can be easily selected via random or grid search optimizing a cross-validation criterion. However, using a scalar hyperparameter limits the algorithm's flexibility and potential for better generalization. In this paper, we address the problem of linear regression with l2-regularization, where a different regularization hyperparameter is associated with each input variable. We optimize these hyperparameters using a gradient-based approach, wherein the gradient of a cross-validation criterion with respect to the regularization hyperparameters is computed analytically through matrix differential calculus. Additionally, we introduce two strategies tailored for sparse model learning problems aiming at reducing the risk of overfitting to the validation data. Numerical examples demonstrate that our multi-hyperparameter regularization approach outperforms LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the era of big data in scientific research, there is a necessity to leverage techniques which reduce human effort in labeling and categorizing large datasets by involving sophisticated machine tools. To combat this problem, we present a novel, general purpose model for 3D segmentation that leverages patch-wise adversariality and Long Short-Term Memory to encode sequential information. Using this model alongside citizen science projects which use 3D datasets (image cubes) on the Zooniverse platforms, we propose an iterative human-machine optimization framework where only a fraction of the 2D slices from these cubes are seen by the volunteers. We leverage the patch-wise discriminator in our model to provide an estimate of which slices within these image cubes have poorly generalized feature representations, and correspondingly poor machine performance. These images with corresponding machine proposals would be presented to volunteers on Zooniverse for correction, leading to a drastic reduction in the volunteer effort on citizen science projects. We trained our model on ~2300 liver tissue 3D electron micrographs. Lipid droplets were segmented within these images through human annotation via the `Etch A Cell - Fat Checker' citizen science project, hosted on the Zooniverse platform. In this work, we demonstrate this framework and the selection methodology which resulted in a measured reduction in volunteer effort by more than 60%. We envision this type of joint human-machine partnership will be of great use on future Zooniverse projects",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in language models have showcased human-comparable performance in academic entrance exams. However, existing studies often overlook questions that require the integration of visual comprehension, thus compromising the full spectrum and complexity inherent in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive framework to evaluate language models on entrance exams, which incorporates both textual and visual elements. We evaluate the two most recent editions of Exame Nacional do Ensino M\\'edio (ENEM), the main standardized entrance examination adopted by Brazilian universities. Our study not only reaffirms the capabilities of GPT-4 as the state of the art for handling complex multidisciplinary questions, but also pioneers in offering a realistic assessment of multimodal language models on Portuguese examinations. One of the highlights is that text captions transcribing visual content outperform the direct use of images, suggesting that the vision model has room for improvement. Yet, despite improvements afforded by images or captions, mathematical questions remain a challenge for these state-of-the-art models.

Assuming access to the exact policy evaluation, both proposed approaches are proved to converge linearly in finding optimal policies of the regularized LQR. Moreover, the IPO method can achieve a super-linear convergence rate once it enters a local region around the optimal policy. Finally, when the optimal policy from a well-understood environment in an RL problem is appropriately transferred as the initial policy to an RL problem with an unknown environment, the IPO method is shown to enable a super-linear convergence rate if the latter is sufficiently close to the former. The performances of these proposed algorithms are supported by numerical examples",

In this paper, we present an implementation of knowledge distillation, demonstrating an overall boost in the student models' performance for the task of classifying jets at the LHC.

To address these issues, we combine IL with a variant of robust MPC that accounts for process and sensing uncertainties, and we design a data augmentation (DA) strategy that enables efficient learning of vision-based policies. The proposed DA method, named Tube-NeRF, leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate novel synthetic images, and uses properties of the robust MPC (the tube) to select relevant views and to efficiently compute the corresponding actions. We tailor our approach to the task of localization and trajectory tracking on a multirotor, by learning a visuomotor policy that generates control actions using images from the onboard camera as only source of horizontal position. Our evaluations numerically demonstrate learning of a robust visuomotor policy with an 80-fold increase in demonstration efficiency and a 50% reduction in training time over current IL methods. Additionally, our policies successfully transfer to a real multirotor, achieving accurate localization and low tracking errors despite large disturbances, with an onboard inference time of only 1.5 ms",

Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods SHapley Additive exPlanations and Individual Conditional Expectation plots were deployed to discover and explain the key determinant factors that influence medical insurance premium prices in the dataset. The dataset used comprised 986 records and is publicly available in the KAGGLE repository. The models were evaluated using four performance evaluation metrics, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The results show that all models produced impressive outcomes; however, the XGBoost model achieved a better overall performance although it also expanded more computational resources, while the RF model recorded a lesser prediction error and consumed far fewer computing resources than the XGBoost model. Furthermore, we compared the outcome of both XAi methods in identifying the key determinant features that influenced the PremiumPrices for each model and whereas both XAi methods produced similar outcomes, we found that the ICE plots showed in more detail the interactions between each variable than the SHAP analysis which seemed to be more high-level.

Recent work has shown that counterfactual explanations - which can be used as a means of single-step recourse - are vulnerable to privacy issues, putting an individuals' privacy at risk. Providing a sequential multi-step path for recourse can amplify this risk. Furthermore, simply adding noise to recourse paths found from existing methods can impact the realism and actionability of the path for an end-user. In this work, we address privacy issues when generating realistic recourse paths based on instance-based counterfactual explanations, and provide PrivRecourse: an end-to-end privacy preserving pipeline that can provide realistic recourse paths. PrivRecourse uses differentially private (DP) clustering to represent non-overlapping subsets of the private dataset. These DP cluster centers are then used to generate recourse paths by forming a graph with cluster centers as the nodes, so that we can generate realistic - feasible and actionable - recourse paths. We empirically evaluate our approach on finance datasets and compare it to simply adding noise to data instances, and to using DP synthetic data, to generate the graph. We observe that PrivRecourse can provide paths that are private and realistic",

    "abstract": "Distributed learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for training large machine learning models. However, in real-world scenarios, participants may be unreliable or malicious, posing a significant challenge to the integrity and accuracy of the trained models. Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, but they often assume full participation from all clients, which is not always practical due to the unavailability of some clients or communication constraints. In our work, we propose the first distributed method with client sampling and provable tolerance to Byzantine workers. The key idea behind the developed method is the use of gradient clipping to control stochastic gradient differences in recursive variance reduction. This allows us to bound the potential harm caused by Byzantine workers, even during iterations when all sampled clients are Byzantine. Furthermore, we incorporate communication compression into the method to enhance communication efficiency. Under quite general assumptions, we prove convergence rates for the proposed method that match the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) theoretical results",

In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly oversampled regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but experience an isotropic loss. For a two-layer network, we obtain the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a new source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations experience an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance.

We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on \"annotator misspecification\" -- failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models -- suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints",

In this work, we further showed that neural networks, wherein individual parameters or activations can take on different precisions ranging between 1 and 4 bits, can achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding the full-precision counterparts. However, the deployment of such networks poses numerous challenges, stemming from the necessity to manage and control the compute/communication/storage requirements associated with these extremely fine-grained mixed precisions for each piece of data. There is a lack of existing efficient hardware and system-level support tailored to these unique and challenging requirements. Our research introduces the first novel holistic hardware-software co-design approach for these networks, which enables a continuous feedback loop between hardware design, training, and inference to facilitate systematic design exploration. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate this co-design approach by designing new, configurable CPU SIMD architectures tailored for these networks, tightly integrating the architecture with new system-aware training and inference techniques. We perform systematic design space exploration using this framework to analyze various tradeoffs. The design for mixed-precision networks that achieves optimized tradeoffs corresponds to an architecture that supports 1, 2, and 4-bit fixed-point operations with four configurable precision patterns, when coupled with system-aware training and inference optimization -- networks trained for this design achieve accuracies that closely match full-precision accuracies, while compressing and improving run-time efficiency of the neural networks drastically by 10-20x, compared to full-precision networks",

We propose DataCOPE, a data-centric framework for evaluating OPE, that answers the questions of whether and to what extent we can evaluate a target policy given a dataset. DataCOPE (1) forecasts the overall performance of OPE algorithms without access to the environment, which is especially useful before real-world deployment where evaluating OPE is impossible; (2) identifies the sub-group in the dataset where OPE can be inaccurate; (3) permits evaluations of datasets or data-collection strategies for OPE problems.

However, most rule models' predictions are undefined or ambiguous when some inputs are missing, forcing users to rely on statistical imputation models or heuristics like zero imputation, undermining the interpretability of the models. In this work, we propose fitting concise yet precise rule models that learn to avoid relying on features with missing values and, therefore, limit their reliance on imputation at test time. We develop MINTY, a method that learns rules in the form of disjunctions between variables that act as replacements for each other when one or more is missing. This results in a sparse linear rule model, regularized to have small dependence on features with missing values, that allows a trade-off between goodness of fit, interpretability, and robustness to missing values at test time. We demonstrate the value of MINTY in experiments using synthetic and real-world data sets and find its predictive performance comparable or favorable to baselines, with smaller reliance on features with missing values",

This dissertation introduces and formalizes a low-cost framework for constructing Subnetwork Ensembles, where a collection of child networks are formed by sampling, perturbing, and optimizing subnetworks from a trained parent model. We explore several distinct methodologies for generating child networks and we evaluate their efficacy through a variety of ablation studies and established benchmarks. Our findings reveal that this approach can greatly improve training efficiency, parametric utilization, and generalization performance while minimizing computational cost. Subnetwork Ensembles offer a compelling framework for exploring how we can build better systems by leveraging the unrealized potential of deep neural networks",

    "title": "Robust Decision Aggregation with Second-order Information",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We consider a decision aggregation problem with two experts who each make a binary recommendation after observing a private signal about an unknown binary world state. An agent, who does not know the joint information structure between signals and states, sees the experts' recommendations and aims to match the action with the true state. Under the scenario, we study whether supplemented additionally with second-order information (each expert's forecast on the other's recommendation) could enable a better aggregation. We adopt a minimax regret framework to evaluate the aggregator's performance, by comparing it to an omniscient benchmark that knows the joint information structure. With general information structures, we show that second-order information provides no benefit. No aggregator can improve over a trivial aggregator, which always follows the first expert's recommendation. However, positive results emerge when we assume experts' signals are conditionally independent given the world state. When the aggregator is deterministic, we present a robust aggregator that leverages second-order information, which can significantly outperform counterparts without it. Second, when two experts are homogeneous, by adding a non-degenerate assumption on the signals, we demonstrate that random aggregators using second-order information can surpass optimal ones without it. In the remaining settings, the second-order information is not beneficial. We also extend the above results to the setting when the aggregator's utility function is more general",

    "title": "Class Uncertainty: A Measure to Mitigate Class Imbalance",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Class-wise characteristics of training examples affect the performance of deep classifiers. A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose \"Class Uncertainty\" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our \"Class Uncertainty\" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20. Code and datasets will be made available",

We are presenting an automatic brain MRI Screening Tool and we are demonstrating its capabilities for detecting tumor-like pathologies.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in cryptocurrency price forecasting, specifically Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Focusing on news and social media data, primarily from Twitter and Reddit, we analyse the influence of public sentiment on cryptocurrency valuations using advanced deep learning NLP methods. Alongside conventional price regression, we treat cryptocurrency price forecasting as a classification problem. This includes both the prediction of price movements (up or down) and the identification of local extrema. We compare the performance of various ML models, both with and without NLP data integration. Our findings reveal that incorporating NLP data significantly enhances the forecasting performance of our models. We discover that pre-trained models, such as Twitter-RoBERTa and BART MNLI, are highly effective in capturing market sentiment, and that fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) also yields substantial forecasting improvements. Notably, the BART MNLI zero-shot classification model shows considerable proficiency in extracting bullish and bearish signals from textual data. All of our models consistently generate profit across different validation scenarios, with no observed decline in profits or reduction in the impact of NLP data over time. The study highlights the potential of text analysis in improving financial forecasts and demonstrates the effectiveness of various NLP techniques in capturing nuanced market sentiment",

In this study, we empirically compared MV and $k$-fold CV using benchmark and real-world datasets. By employing Bayesian tests, we compared generalization estimates yielding three posterior probabilities: practical equivalence, CV superiority, and MV superiority. We also evaluated the differences in the capacity of the selected models and computational efficiency. We found that both MV and CV select models with practically equivalent generalization performance across various machine learning algorithms and the majority of benchmark datasets. MV exhibited advantages in terms of selecting simpler models and lower computational costs. However, in some cases MV selected overly simplistic models leading to underfitting and showed instability in hyperparameter selection. These limitations of MV became more evident in the evaluation of a real-world neuroscientific task of predicting sex at birth using brain functional connectivity",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a machine learning-based decentralized time division multiple access (TDMA) algorithm for visible light communication (VLC) Internet of Things (IoT) networks is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. This paper considers a decentralized condition in which there is no coordinator node for sending synchronization frames and assigning transmission time slots to other nodes. The proposed algorithm uses a decentralized manner for synchronization, and each node uses the Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal transmission time slot for sending data without collisions. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a VLC hardware system, which had been designed and implemented in our laboratory. Average reward, convergence time, goodput, average delay, and data packet size are evaluated parameters. The results show that the proposed algorithm converges quickly and provides collision-free decentralized TDMA for the network. The proposed algorithm is compared with carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm as a potential selection for decentralized VLC IoT networks. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides up to 61% more goodput and up to 49% less average delay than CSMA/CA",

    "abstract": "Retrosynthesis poses a fundamental challenge in biopharmaceuticals, aiming to aid chemists in finding appropriate reactant molecules and synthetic pathways given determined product molecules. With the reactant and product represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph generative task. Inspired by the recent advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method designed to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based graph-to-graph framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation is to develop a multi-stage diffusion process. In this method, we decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products and then generate the external bonds to connect the products and generated groups. Interestingly, such a generation process is exactly the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis procedure, i.e. from reaction center identification to synthon completion, which significantly reduces the error accumulation. Experimental results on the benchmark have demonstrated the superiority of our method over all other semi-template methods",

In this work, we propose an ensemble diversification framework exploiting Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) for shortcut bias mitigation. We show that at particular training intervals, DPMs can generate images with novel feature combinations, even when trained on images displaying correlated input features. We leverage this crucial property to generate synthetic counterfactuals to increase model diversity via ensemble disagreement. We show that DPM-guided diversification is sufficient to remove dependence on primary shortcut cues, without a need for additional supervised signals. We further empirically quantify its efficacy on several diversification objectives, and finally show improved generalization and diversification performance on par with prior work that relies on auxiliary data collection",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to efficiently learn new tasks by leveraging multiple pre-trained models without requiring their original training data. Existing inversion-based DFML methods construct pseudo tasks from a learnable dataset, which is inversely generated from the pre-trained model pool. For the first time, we reveal two major challenges hindering their practical deployments: Task-Distribution Shift (TDS) and Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC). TDS leads to a biased meta-learner because of the skewed task distribution towards newly generated tasks. TDC occurs when untrusted models characterized by misleading labels or poor quality pollute the task distribution. To tackle these issues, we introduce a robust DFML framework that ensures task distributional robustness. We propose to meta-learn from a pseudo task distribution, diversified through task interpolation within a compact task-memory buffer. This approach reduces the meta-learner's overreliance on newly generated tasks by maintaining consistent performance across a broader range of interpolated memory tasks, thus ensuring its generalization for unseen tasks. Additionally, our framework seamlessly incorporates an automated model selection mechanism into the meta-training phase, parameterizing each model's reliability as a learnable weight. This is optimized with a policy gradient algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning, effectively addressing the non-differentiable challenge posed by model selection. Comprehensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in mitigating TDS and TDC, underscoring its potential to improve DFML in real-world scenarios",

As a result, there is an increased risk of overfitting to its excessively used test set, which is only one hour duration. To alleviate this issue, we build a new VSR test set named WildVSR, by closely following the LRS3 dataset creation processes. We then evaluate and analyse the extent to which the current VSR models generalize to the new test data. We evaluate a broad range of publicly available VSR models and find significant drops in performance on our test set, compared to their corresponding LRS3 results. Our results suggest that the increase in word error rates is caused by the models inability to generalize to slightly harder and in the wild lip sequences than those found in the LRS3 test set. Our new test benchmark is made public in order to enable future research towards more robust VSR models",

    "title": "DPSUR: Accelerating Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent Using Selective Update and Release",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to memorize private data to reduce their training loss, which can be inadvertently exploited by privacy attacks such as model inversion and membership inference. To protect against these attacks, differential privacy (DP) has become the de facto standard for privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly those popular training algorithms using stochastic gradient descent, such as DPSGD. Nonetheless, DPSGD still suffers from severe utility loss due to its slow convergence. This is partially caused by the random sampling, which brings bias and variance to the gradient, and partially by the Gaussian noise, which leads to fluctuation of gradient updates. Our key idea to address these issues is to apply selective updates to the model training, while discarding those useless or even harmful updates. Motivated by this, this paper proposes DPSUR, a Differentially Private training framework based on Selective Updates and Release, where the gradient from each iteration is evaluated based on a validation test, and only those updates leading to convergence are applied to the model. As such, DPSUR ensures the training in the right direction and thus can achieve faster convergence than DPSGD. The main challenges lie in two aspects -- privacy concerns arising from gradient evaluation, and gradient selection strategy for model update. To address the challenges, DPSUR introduces a clipping strategy for update randomization and a threshold mechanism for gradient selection. Experiments conducted on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDB datasets show that DPSUR significantly outperforms previous works in terms of convergence speed and model utility",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of large-scale distributed clients without data sharing. However, due to the disparity of computing resources among massive mobile computing devices, the performance of traditional homogeneous model-based Federated Learning (FL) is seriously limited. On the one hand, to achieve model training in all the diverse clients, mobile computing systems can only use small low-performance models for collaborative learning. On the other hand, devices with high computing resources cannot train a high-performance large model with their insufficient raw data. To address the resource-constrained problem in mobile computing systems, we present a novel heterogeneous FL approach named AdapterFL, which uses a model reassemble strategy to facilitate collaborative training of massive heterogeneous mobile devices adaptively. Specifically, we select multiple candidate heterogeneous models based on the computing performance of massive mobile devices and then divide each heterogeneous model into two partitions. By reassembling the partitions, we can generate models with varied sizes that are combined by the partial parameters of the large model with the partial parameters of the small model. Using these reassembled models for FL training, we can train the partial parameters of the large model using low-performance devices. In this way, we can alleviate performance degradation in large models due to resource constraints. The experimental results show that AdapterFL can achieve up to 12\\% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods in resource-constrained scenarios",

Furthermore, we propose extended feature sets of prior realizations and a periodic retraining scheme that allows the normalizing flow to adapt to the changing conditions of modern electricity markets. In particular, we investigate the impact of the energy crisis ensuing from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our results highlight that the normalizing flow generates high-quality scenarios that reproduce the true price distribution and yield highly accurate forecasts. Additionally, our analysis highlights how our improvements towards adaptations in changing regimes allow the normalizing flow to adapt to changing market conditions and enables continued sampling of high-quality day-ahead price scenarios",

One potentially suitable approach is generative replay, where a copy of a generative model trained on previous tasks produces synthetic data that are interleaved with data from the current task. However, standard generative replay applied to diffusion models results in a catastrophic loss in denoising capabilities. In this paper, we propose generative distillation, an approach that distils the entire reverse process of a diffusion model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cloud formations often obscure optical satellite-based monitoring of the Earth's surface, thus limiting Earth observation (EO) activities such as land cover mapping, ocean color analysis, and cropland monitoring. The integration of machine learning (ML) methods within the remote sensing domain has significantly improved performance on a wide range of EO tasks, including cloud detection and filtering, but there is still much room for improvement. A key bottleneck is that ML methods typically depend on large amounts of annotated data for training, which is often difficult to come by in EO contexts. This is especially true for the task of cloud optical thickness (COT) estimation. A reliable estimation of COT enables more fine-grained and application-dependent control compared to using pre-specified cloud categories, as is commonly done in practice. To alleviate the COT data scarcity problem, in this work we propose a novel synthetic dataset for COT estimation, where top-of-atmosphere radiances have been simulated for 12 of the spectral bands of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2 platforms. These data points have been simulated under consideration of different cloud types, COTs, and ground surface and atmospheric profiles. Extensive experimentation of training several ML models to predict COT from the measured reflectivity of the spectral bands demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed dataset. Generalization to real data is also demonstrated on two satellite image datasets -- one that is publicly available, and one which we have collected and annotated.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models often exhibit overconfidence in predicting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, underscoring the crucial role of OOD detection in ensuring reliability in predictions. Among various OOD detection approaches, post-hoc detectors have gained significant popularity, primarily due to their ease of use and implementation. However, the effectiveness of most post-hoc OOD detectors has been constrained as they rely solely either on extreme information, such as the maximum logit, or on the collective information (i.e., information spanned across classes or training samples) embedded within the output layer. In this paper, we propose ExCeL that combines both extreme and collective information within the output layer for enhanced accuracy in OOD detection. We leverage the logit of the top predicted class as the extreme information (i.e., the maximum logit), while the collective information is derived in a novel approach that involves assessing the likelihood of other classes appearing in subsequent ranks across various training samples. Our idea is motivated by the observation that, for in-distribution (ID) data, the ranking of classes beyond the predicted class is more deterministic compared to that in OOD data. Experiments conducted on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-200 datasets demonstrate that ExCeL consistently is among the five top-performing methods out of twenty-one existing post-hoc baselines when the joint performance on near-OOD and far-OOD is considered (i.e., in terms of AUROC and FPR95). Furthermore, ExCeL shows the best overall performance across both datasets, unlike other baselines that work best on one dataset but has a performance drop in the other",

This results in limited explainability in the HPO process, rendering a lack of human trust and difficulties in pinpointing algorithm bottlenecks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on this black box by conducting large-scale fitness landscape analysis (FLA) on 1,500 HP loss landscapes of 6 ML models with more than 11 model configurations, across 67 datasets and different levels of fidelities. We reveal the first unified, comprehensive portrait of their topographies in terms of smoothness, neutrality and modality. We also show that such properties are highly transferable across datasets and fidelities, providing fundamental evidence for the success of multi-fidelity and transfer learning methods. These findings are made possible by developing a dedicated FLA framework that incorporates a combination of visual and quantitative measures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unmodeled aerodynamic disturbances pose a key challenge for multirotor flight when multiple vehicles are in close proximity to each other. However, certain missions \\textit{require} two multirotors to approach each other within 1-2 body-lengths of each other and hold formation -- we consider one such practical instance: vertically docking two multirotors in the air. In this leader-follower setting, the follower experiences significant downwash interference from the leader in its final docking stages. To compensate for this, we employ a learnt downwash model online within an optimal feedback controller to accurately track a docking maneuver and then hold formation. Through real-world flights with different maneuvers, we demonstrate that this compensation is crucial for reducing the large vertical separation otherwise required by conventional/naive approaches. Our evaluations show a tracking error of less than 0.06m for the follower (a 3-4x reduction) when approaching vertically within two body-lengths of the leader. Finally, we deploy the complete system to effect a successful physical docking between two airborne multirotors in a single smooth planned trajectory",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Current automatic lyrics transcription (ALT) benchmarks focus exclusively on word content and ignore the finer nuances of written lyrics including formatting and punctuation, which leads to a potential misalignment with the creative products of musicians and songwriters as well as listeners' experiences. For example, line breaks are important in conveying information about rhythm, emotional emphasis, rhyme, and high-level structure. To address this issue, we introduce Jam-ALT, a new lyrics transcription benchmark based on the JamendoLyrics dataset. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, a complete revision of the transcripts, geared specifically towards ALT evaluation by following a newly created annotation guide that unifies the music industry's guidelines, covering aspects such as punctuation, line breaks, spelling, background vocals, and non-word sounds. Secondly, a suite of evaluation metrics designed, unlike the traditional word error rate, to capture such phenomena. We hope that the proposed benchmark contributes to the ALT task, enabling more precise and reliable assessments of transcription systems and enhancing the user experience in lyrics applications such as subtitle renderings for live captioning or karaoke",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Home delivery failures, traffic congestion, and relatively large handling times have a negative impact on the profitability of last-mile logistics. These external factors contribute to up to $28\\%$ of the overall costs and $25\\%$ of emissions for the home delivery supply chain. A potential solution, showing annual growth rates up to $36\\%$, is the delivery to parcel lockers or parcel shops, denoted by out-of-home (OOH) delivery. In the academic literature, models of customer behavior with respect to OOH delivery were so far limited to deterministic settings, contrasting with the stochastic nature of actual customer choices. We model the sequential decision-making problem of which OOH location to offer against what incentive for each incoming customer, taking into account future customer arrivals and choices. We propose Dynamic Selection and Pricing of OOH (DSPO), an algorithmic pipeline that uses a novel spatial-temporal state encoding as input to a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the performance of our method by benchmarking it against three state-of-the-art approaches. Our extensive numerical study, guided by real-world data, reveals that DSPO can save $20.8\\%$ in costs compared to a situation without OOH locations, $8.1\\%$ compared to a static selection and pricing policy, and $4.6\\%$ compared to a state-of-the-art demand management benchmark. We provide comprehensive insights into the complex interplay between OOH delivery dynamics and customer behavior influenced by pricing strategies. The implications of our findings suggest practitioners to adopt dynamic selection and pricing policies as OOH delivery gains a larger market share",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are becoming integral in healthcare technologies, presenting a critical need for formal assurance to validate their safety, fairness, robustness, and trustworthiness. These models are inherently prone to errors, potentially posing serious risks to patient health and could even cause irreparable harm. Traditional software assurance techniques rely on fixed code and do not directly apply to ML models since these algorithms are adaptable and learn from curated datasets through a training process. However, adapting established principles, such as boundary testing using synthetic test data can effectively bridge this gap. To this end, we present a novel technique called Mix-Up Boundary Analysis (MUBA) that facilitates evaluating image classifiers in terms of prediction fairness. We evaluated MUBA for two important medical imaging tasks -- brain tumour classification and breast cancer classification -- and achieved promising results. This research aims to showcase the importance of adapting traditional assurance principles for assessing ML models to enhance the safety and reliability of healthcare technologies.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also \\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark.

However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when confronted with high-order tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes, commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. Our objective in this study is to provide an effective tensor recovery technique for handling non-smooth changes in tensor data and efficiently explore the correlations of high-order tensor data across its various dimensions without introducing numerous variables and weights. To this end, we introduce a new tensor decomposition and a new tensor norm called the Tensor $U_1$ norm. We utilize these novel techniques in solving the problem of high-order tensor completion problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of the resulting tensor completion models. An optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting tensor completion model iteratively by combining the proximal algorithm with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Theoretical analysis showed the convergence of the algorithm to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in high-order tensor completion, especially for tensor data with non-smooth changes",

    "title": "Learning Uniform Clusters on Hypersphere for Deep Graph-level Clustering",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph clustering has been popularly studied in recent years. However, most existing graph clustering methods focus on node-level clustering, i.e., grouping nodes in a single graph into clusters. In contrast, graph-level clustering, i.e., grouping multiple graphs into clusters, remains largely unexplored. Graph-level clustering is critical in a variety of real-world applications, such as, properties prediction of molecules and community analysis in social networks. However, graph-level clustering is challenging due to the insufficient discriminability of graph-level representations, and the insufficient discriminability makes deep clustering be more likely to obtain degenerate solutions (cluster collapse). To address the issue, we propose a novel deep graph-level clustering method called Uniform Deep Graph Clustering (UDGC). UDGC assigns instances evenly to different clusters and then scatters those clusters on unit hypersphere, leading to a more uniform cluster-level distribution and a slighter cluster collapse. Specifically, we first propose Augmentation-Consensus Optimal Transport (ACOT) for generating uniformly distributed and reliable pseudo labels for partitioning clusters. Then we adopt contrastive learning to scatter those clusters. Besides, we propose Center Alignment Optimal Transport (CAOT) for guiding the model to learn better parameters, which further promotes the cluster performance. Our empirical study on eight well-known datasets demonstrates that UDGC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models",

LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for processing data sequences and avoiding the long-term dependency problem. We employed data from real-world vehicles and the global positioning system (GPS) sensors. A critical pre-processing step was developed to address varying sensor frequencies and inconsistent GPS time steps and dropouts. The LSTM-based system's performance was compared with the Kalman Filter. The system was tuned to work in real-time with low latency and high precision. We tested our system on roads under various driving conditions, including acceleration, turns, deceleration, and straight paths. We tested our proposed solution's accuracy and inference time and showed that it could perform in real-time. Our LSTM-based system yielded an average error of 0.11 meters with an inference time of 2 ms. This represents a 76\\% reduction in error compared to the traditional Kalman filter method, which has an average error of 0.46 meters with a similar inference time to the LSTM-based system",

    "abstract": "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is pivotal for power system operations, guiding generator output and power distribution to meet demand at minimized costs, while adhering to physical and engineering constraints. The integration of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, however, poses challenges due to their inherent variability. This variability, driven largely by changing weather conditions, demands frequent recalibrations of power settings, thus necessitating recurrent OPF resolutions. This task is daunting using traditional numerical methods, particularly for extensive power systems. In this work, we present a cutting-edge, physics-informed machine learning methodology, trained using imitation learning and historical European weather datasets. Our approach directly correlates electricity demand and weather patterns with power dispatch and generation, circumventing the iterative requirements of traditional OPF solvers. This offers a more expedient solution apt for real-time applications. Rigorous evaluations on aggregated European power systems validate our method's superiority over existing data-driven techniques in OPF solving. By presenting a quick, robust, and efficient solution, this research sets a new standard in real-time OPF resolution, paving the way for more resilient power systems in the era of renewable energy",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and people's daily lives in unprecedented ways. To make appropriate decisions, it is necessary to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and accurately. Clinical decision making is influenced by data collected from patients. With the aid of artificial intelligence, COVID-19 has been diagnosed quickly by analyzing symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography scans, chest X-rays, routine laboratory blood tests and even cough sounds. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict a patient's morality, although there is a question about which data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study consists of two parts. Our first objective is to examine whether machine learning algorithms can predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death), based on the features present in the dataset. In the second part of the research, we investigated the impact of clinical and RT-PCR on prediction of recovery and decease to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with different feature sets and use six machine learning methods to build prediction model. With an accuracy of 78.7%, random forest showed promising results for predicting death and recovery of patients. Based on this, it appears that recovery and decease of patients are predictable using machine learning. For second objective, results indicate that clinical alone (without using RT-PCR), trained with AdaBoost algorithm, is the most accurate with an accuracy of 82.1%.

    "abstract": "In the context of natural disasters, human responses inevitably intertwine with natural factors. The COVID-19 pandemic, as a significant stress factor, has brought to light profound variations among different countries in terms of their adaptive dynamics in addressing the spread of infection outbreaks across different regions. This emphasizes the crucial role of cultural characteristics in natural disaster analysis. The theoretical understanding of large-scale epidemics primarily relies on mean-field kinetic models. However, conventional SIR-like models failed to fully explain the observed phenomena at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. These phenomena included the unexpected cessation of exponential growth, the reaching of plateaus, and the occurrence of multi-wave dynamics. In situations where an outbreak of a highly virulent and unfamiliar infection arises, it becomes crucial to respond swiftly at a non-medical level to mitigate the negative socio-economic impact. Here we present a theoretical examination of the first wave of the epidemic based on a simple SIRSS model (SIR with Social Stress). We conduct an analysis of the socio-cultural features of na\\\"ive population behaviors across various countries worldwide. The unique characteristics of each country/territory are encapsulated in only a few constants within our model, derived from the fitted COVID-19 statistics. These constants also reflect the societal response dynamics to the external stress factor, underscoring the importance of studying the mutual behavior of humanity and natural factors during global social disasters. Based on these distinctive characteristics of specific regions, local authorities can optimize their strategies to effectively combat epidemics until vaccines are developed",

Several methods have been proposed to quantify the trabeculae accurately in the left ventricle, but there is no general agreement in the medical community to use a particular approach. In previous work, we proposed DL-LVTQ, a deep learning approach for left ventricular trabecular quantification based on a U-Net CNN architecture. DL-LVTQ was an automatic diagnosis tool developed from a dataset of patients with the same cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). In this work, we have extended and adapted DL-LVTQ to cope with patients with different cardiomyopathies. The dataset consists of up 379 patients in three groups with different particularities and cardiomyopathies. Patient images were taken from different scanners and hospitals. We have modified and adapted the U-Net convolutional neural network to account for the different particularities of a heterogeneous group of patients with various unclassifiable or mixed and inherited cardiomyopathies. The inclusion of new groups of patients has increased the accuracy, specificity and kappa values while maintaining the sensitivity of the automatic deep learning method proposed. Therefore, a better-prepared diagnosis tool is ready for various cardiomyopathies with different characteristics. Cardiologists have considered that 98.9% of the evaluated outputs are verified clinically for diagnosis. Therefore, the high precision to segment the different cardiac structures allows us to make a robust diagnostic system objective and faster, decreasing human error and time spent",

The number of studies on modeling, optimization, simulation, and data analysis of transportation systems is on the rise.

Each of these networks exhibits unique characteristics in their topology, making their applications distinct for various study objectives. Despite their widespread use in research, there is a lack of comprehensive study addressing the classification of these networks based on their topological characteristics. This study aims to fill this gap by employing unsupervised learning methods, particularly clustering. We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating various topological network characteristics. Additionally, we employ two dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP), to reduce overlaps of highly correlated features and enhance the interpretability of the subsequent classification results. We then utilize two clustering algorithms, K-means and HDBSCAN, to classify 14 transportation networks.

    "abstract": "Self-training techniques have shown remarkable value across many deep learning models and tasks. However, such techniques remain largely unexplored when considered in the context of learning fast solvers for systems of partial differential equations (Eg: Neural Operators). In this work, we explore the use of self-training for Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). Neural Operators emerged as a data driven technique, however, data from experiments or traditional solvers is not always readily available. Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO) overcome this constraint by utilizing a physics loss for the training, however the accuracy of PINO trained without data does not match the performance obtained by training with data. In this work we show that self-training can be used to close this gap in performance. We examine canonical examples, namely the 1D-Burgers and 2D-Darcy PDEs, to showcase the efficacy of self-training. Specifically, FNOs, when trained exclusively with physics loss through self-training, approach 1.07x for Burgers and 1.02x for Darcy, compared to FNOs trained with both data and physics loss. Furthermore, we discover that pseudo-labels can be used for self-training without necessarily training to convergence in each iteration. A consequence of this is that we are able to discover self-training schedules that improve upon the baseline performance of PINO in terms of accuracy as well as time",

However, in its original formulation, solving this problem suffers from a significant computational burden. Thus, a meaningful line of work consists at proposing alternatives to reduce this burden while still enjoying its properties. In this thesis, we focus on alternatives which use projections on subspaces. The main such alternative is the Sliced-Wasserstein distance, which we first propose to extend to Riemannian manifolds in order to use it in Machine Learning applications for which using such spaces has been shown to be beneficial in the recent years. We also study sliced distances between positive measures in the so-called unbalanced OT problem. Back to the original Euclidean Sliced-Wasserstein distance between probability measures, we study the dynamic of gradient flows when endowing the space with this distance in place of the usual Wasserstein distance. Then, we investigate the use of the Busemann function, a generalization of the inner product in metric spaces, in the space of probability measures. Finally, we extend the subspace detour approach to incomparable spaces using the Gromov-Wasserstein distance",

To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Latent (Markov) Variable Inverse Q-learning (L(M)V-IQL) algorithms, a novel IRL framework tailored for accommodating discrete intrinsic rewards. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization approach, we cluster observed trajectories into distinct intentions and independently solve the IRL problem for each. Demonstrating the efficacy of L(M)V-IQL through simulated experiments and its application to different real mouse behavior datasets, our approach surpasses current benchmarks in animal behavior prediction, producing interpretable reward functions. This advancement holds promise for neuroscience and psychology, contributing to a deeper understanding of animal decision-making and uncovering underlying brain mechanisms",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we highlight that both conformity and risk preference matter in making fund investment decisions beyond personal interest and seek to jointly characterize these aspects in a disentangled manner. Consequently, we develop a novel M ulti-granularity Graph Disentangled Learning framework named MGDL to effectively perform intelligent matching of fund investment products. Benefiting from the well-established fund graph and the attention module, multi-granularity user representations are derived from historical behaviors to separately express personal interest, conformity and risk preference in a fine-grained way. To attain stronger disentangled representations with specific semantics, MGDL explicitly involve two self-supervised signals, i.e., fund type based contrasts and fund popularity.

With the success of deep learning in the past decade, a recent trend in combinatorial optimization has been to improve state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic components with machine learning (ML) models. In this paper, we investigate two essential aspects of machine learning algorithms for combinatorial optimization: temporal characteristics and attention. We argue that for the task of variable selection in the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm, incorporating the temporal information as well as the bipartite graph attention improves the solver's performance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle. In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline. Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept",

    "abstract": "Model averaging has received much attention in the past two decades, which integrates available information by averaging over potential models. Although various model averaging methods have been developed, there are few literatures on the theoretical properties of model averaging from the perspective of stability, and the majority of these methods constrain model weights to a simplex. The aim of this paper is to introduce stability from statistical learning theory into model averaging. Thus, we define the stability, asymptotic empirical risk minimizer, generalization, and consistency of model averaging and study the relationship among them. Our results indicate that stability can ensure that model averaging has good generalization performance and consistency under reasonable conditions, where consistency means model averaging estimator can asymptotically minimize the mean squared prediction error. We also propose a L2-penalty model averaging method without limiting model weights and prove that it has stability and consistency. In order to reduce the impact of tuning parameter selection, we use 10-fold cross-validation to select a candidate set of tuning parameters and perform a weighted average of the estimators of model weights based on estimation errors. The Monte Carlo simulation and an illustrative application demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The automated analysis of medical time series, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), pulse oximetry, etc, has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for diagnostic decisions, allowing for remote monitoring of patients and more efficient use of expensive and time-consuming medical procedures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to process such signals effectively. However, previous research has primarily focused on classifying medical time series rather than attempting to regress the continuous-valued physiological parameters central to diagnosis. One significant challenge in this regard is the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as a low prevalence of abnormal conditions can lead to heavily skewed data that results in inaccurate predictions and a lack of certainty in such predictions when deployed. To address these challenges, we propose HypUC, a framework for imbalanced probabilistic regression in medical time series, making several contributions. (i) We introduce a simple kernel density-based technique to tackle the imbalanced regression problem with medical time series. (ii) Moreover, we employ a probabilistic regression framework that allows uncertainty estimation for the predicted continuous values. (iii) We also present a new approach to calibrate the predicted uncertainty further. (iv) Finally, we demonstrate a technique to use calibrated uncertainty estimates to improve the predicted continuous value and show the efficacy of the calibrated uncertainty estimates to flag unreliable predictions. HypUC is evaluated on a large, diverse, real-world dataset of ECGs collected from millions of patients, outperforming several conventional baselines on various diagnostic tasks, suggesting a potential use-case for the reliable clinical deployment of deep learning models",

Despite the promise of AI-enhanced NMR prediction models, challenges persist in the interpretation of spectra for tasks such as molecular retrieval, isomer recognition, and peak assignment. In response, this paper introduces Multi-Level Multimodal Alignment with Knowledge-Guided Instance-Wise Discrimination (K-M3AID) to establish meaningful correspondences between two heterogeneous modalities: molecular graphs (structures) and NMR spectra. In particular, K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture, and incorporates a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, the framework introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module, significantly enhancing accuracy in cross-modal alignment. Additionally, K-M3AID showcases its capability of meta-learning by demonstrating that skills acquired during node-level alignment positively impact graph-level alignment. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in addressing multiple zero-shot tasks, offering a promising solution to bridge the gap between structural information and spectral data in complex NMR scenarios",

Existing domain generalization research typically attributes domain shifts to concept shift, which relates to alterations in class labels, and covariate shift, which pertains to variations in data styles. In this paper, by introducing another form of distribution shift, known as dependence shift, which involves variations in fair dependence patterns across domains, we propose a novel domain generalization approach that addresses domain shifts by considering both covariate and dependence shifts. We assert the existence of an underlying transformation model can transform data from one domain to another. By generating data in synthetic domains through the model, a fairness-aware invariant classifier is learned that enforces both model accuracy and fairness in unseen domains.

    "title": "Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Very recently, studies have shown that quantum neural networks surpass classical neural networks in tasks like image classification when a similar number of learnable parameters are used. However, the development and optimization of quantum models are currently hindered by issues such as qubit instability and limited qubit availability, leading to error-prone systems with weak performance. In contrast, classical models can exhibit high-performance owing to substantial resource availability. As a result, more studies have been focusing on hybrid classical-quantum integration. A line of research particularly focuses on transfer learning through classical-quantum integration or quantum-quantum approaches. Unlike previous studies, this paper introduces a new method to transfer knowledge from classical to quantum neural networks using knowledge distillation, effectively bridging the gap between classical machine learning and emergent quantum computing techniques. We adapt classical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like LeNet and AlexNet to serve as teacher networks, facilitating the training of student quantum models by sending supervisory signals during backpropagation through KL-divergence. The approach yields significant performance improvements for the quantum models by solely depending on classical CNNs, with quantum models achieving an average accuracy improvement of 0.80% on the MNIST dataset and 5.40% on the more complex Fashion MNIST dataset. Applying this technique eliminates the cumbersome training of huge quantum models for transfer learning in resource-constrained settings and enables re-using existing pre-trained classical models to improve performance.Thus, this study paves the way for future research in quantum machine learning (QML) by positioning knowledge distillation as a core technique for advancing QML applications",

A key source for understanding a table is the semantics of its columns. With the rise of deep learning, learned table representations are now available, which can be applied for semantic type detection and achieve good performance on benchmarks. Nevertheless, we observe a gap between this performance and its applicability in practice. In this paper, we propose AdaTyper to address one of the most critical deployment challenges: adaptation. AdaTyper uses weak-supervision to adapt a hybrid type predictor towards new semantic types and shifted data distributions at inference time, using minimal human feedback. The hybrid type predictor of AdaTyper combines rule-based methods and a light machine learning model for semantic column type detection. We evaluate the adaptation performance of AdaTyper on real-world database tables hand-annotated with semantic column types through crowdsourcing and find that the f1-score improves for new and existing types. AdaTyper approaches an average precision of 0.6 after only seeing 5 examples, significantly outperforming existing adaptation methods based on human-provided regular expressions or dictionaries",

In this paper, we consider the semantic communication (SemCom) system with multiple users, where there is a limited number of training samples and unexpected interference. To improve the model generalization ability and reduce the model size, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) based system where Transformer based encoder-decoder is implemented as the semantic encoder-decoder and fully connected neural networks are implemented as the channel encoder-decoder. Specifically, four types of knowledge transfer and model compression are analyzed. Important system and model parameters are considered, including the level of noise and interference, the number of interfering users and the size of the encoder and decoder. Numerical results demonstrate that KD significantly improves the robustness and the generalization ability when applied to unexpected interference, and it reduces the performance loss when compressing the model size",

This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\\widetilde \\Theta(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank. Our result also generalizes prior works on three-layer neural networks, which were restricted to the case of $p$ being a quadratic. When $p$ is indeed a quadratic, we achieve the information-theoretically optimal sample complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$, which is an improvement over prior work~\\citep{nichani2023provable} requiring a sample size of $\\widetilde\\Theta(d^4)$.

Traditional fair spectral clustering (FSC) methods consist of two consecutive stages, i.e., performing fair spectral embedding on a given graph and conducting $k$means to obtain discrete cluster labels. However, in practice, the graph is usually unknown, and we need to construct the underlying graph from potentially noisy data, the quality of which inevitably affects subsequent fair clustering performance. Furthermore, performing FSC through separate steps breaks the connections among these steps, leading to suboptimal results. To this end, we first theoretically analyze the effect of the constructed graph on FSC. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a novel graph construction method with a node-adaptive graph filter to learn graphs from noisy data. Then, all independent stages of conventional FSC are integrated into a single objective function, forming an end-to-end framework that inputs raw data and outputs discrete cluster labels. An algorithm is developed to jointly and alternately update the variables in each stage. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real data, which show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art fair clustering methods",

We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes expected outcomes while satisfying budget constraints, in the long run. Our proposed policy waitlists each individual for the resource maximizing the difference between their estimated mean treatment outcome and the estimated resource dual-price or, roughly, the opportunity cost of using the resource. Resources are then allocated as they arrive, in a first-come first-serve fashion. We demonstrate that our data-driven policy almost surely asymptotically achieves the expected outcome of the optimal out-of-sample policy under mild technical assumptions. We extend our framework to incorporate various fairness constraints. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problem of designing policies for allocating scarce housing resources to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles based on data from the homeless management information system.

Then, original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered multi-modal feature maps to enable self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments show that the representation learned via NS-MAE shows promising transferability for diverse multi-modal and single-modal (camera-only and Lidar-only) perception models on diverse 3D perception downstream tasks (3D object detection and BEV map segmentation) with diverse amounts of fine-tuning labeled data.

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have become the most popular approach to deep generative modeling of images, largely due to their empirical performance and reliability. Recently, a number of theoretical works \\citep{chen2022, Chen2022ImprovedAO, Chenetal23flowode, benton2023linear} have shown that diffusion models can efficiently sample, assuming $L^2$-accurate score estimates. The score-matching objective naturally approximates the true score in $L^2$, but the sample complexity of existing bounds depends \\emph{polynomially} on the data radius and desired Wasserstein accuracy. By contrast, the time complexity of sampling is only logarithmic in these parameters. We show that estimating the score in $L^2$ \\emph{requires} this polynomial dependence, but that a number of samples that scales polylogarithmically in the Wasserstein accuracy actually do suffice for sampling. We show that with a polylogarithmic number of samples, the ERM of the score-matching objective is $L^2$ accurate on all but a probability $\\delta$ fraction of the true distribution, and that this weaker guarantee is sufficient for efficient sampling",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question-answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce \\textsc{FinMe}, a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making, encompassing three core modules: Profiling, to outline the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered processing, to aid the agent in assimilating realistic hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably, \\textsc{FinMe}'s memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders, offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare \\textsc{FinMe} with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks and funds. We then fine-tuned the agent's perceptual spans to achieve a significant trading performance. Collectively, \\textsc{FinMe} presents a cutting-edge LLM agent framework for automated trading, boosting cumulative investment returns",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Managing project risk is a key part of the successful implementation of any large project and is widely recognized as a best practice for public agencies to deliver infrastructures. The conventional method of identifying and evaluating project risks involves getting input from subject matter experts at risk workshops in the early phases of a project. As a project moves through its life cycle, these identified risks and their assessments evolve. Some risks are realized to become issues, some are mitigated, and some are retired as no longer important. Despite the value provided by conventional expert-based approaches, several challenges remain due to the time-consuming and expensive processes involved. Moreover, limited is known about how risks evolve from ex-ante to ex-post over time. How well does the project team identify and evaluate risks in the initial phase compared to what happens during project execution? Using historical data and artificial intelligence techniques, this study addressed these limitations by introducing a data-driven framework to identify risks automatically and to examine the quality of early risk registers and risk assessments.

We approach this problem using artificial neural networks and build a modular system estimating gaze from separately cropped eyes, taking advantage of existing well-functioning components for face detection (RetinaFace) and head pose estimation (6DRepNet). Our proposed method does not require any special hardware or infrared filters but uses a standard notebook-builtin RGB camera, as often approached with appearance-based methods. Using the MetaHuman tool, we also generated a large synthetic dataset of more than 57,000 human faces and made it publicly available. The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods. We also verified the feasibility of our model by its preliminary testing in real-world setting using the builtin 4K camera in NICO semi-humanoid robot's eye",

    "title": "Boosting the Power of Small Multimodal Reasoning Models to Match Larger Models with Self-Consistency Training",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multimodal reasoning is a challenging task that requires models to reason across multiple modalities to answer questions. Existing approaches have made progress by incorporating language and visual modalities into a two-stage reasoning framework, separating rationale generation from answer inference. However, these approaches often fall short due to the inadequate quality of the generated rationales. In this work, we delve into the importance of rationales in model reasoning. We observe that when rationales are completely accurate, the model's accuracy significantly improves, highlighting the need for high-quality rationale generation. Motivated by this, we propose MC-CoT, a self-consistency training strategy that generates multiple rationales and answers, subsequently selecting the most accurate through a voting process. This approach not only enhances the quality of generated rationales but also leads to more accurate and robust answers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across various benchmarks. Remarkably, we show that even smaller base models, when equipped with our proposed approach, can achieve results comparable to those of larger models, illustrating the potential of our approach in harnessing the power of rationales for improved multimodal reasoning.

    "title": "AI-Generated Images Introduce Invisible Relevance Bias to Text-Image Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of generation models, AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming more realistic, flooding the Internet. A recent study suggests that this phenomenon has elevated the issue of source bias in text retrieval for web searches. Specifically, neural retrieval models tend to rank generated texts higher than human-written texts. In this paper, we extend the study of this bias to cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we successfully construct a suitable benchmark to explore the existence of the bias. Subsequent extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that AI-generated images introduce an invisible relevance bias to text-image retrieval models. Specifically, our experiments show that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant features to the query than real images. This invisible relevance bias is prevalent across retrieval models with varying training data and architectures. Furthermore, our subsequent exploration reveals that the inclusion of AI-generated images in the training data of the retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. The above phenomenon triggers a vicious cycle, which makes the invisible relevance bias become more and more serious. To elucidate the potential causes of invisible relevance and address the aforementioned issues, we introduce an effective training method aimed at alleviating the invisible relevance bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of invisible relevance, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information exhibits a certain consistency across generated images with different semantics and can make the retriever estimate a higher relevance score",

Our approach treats saliency prediction as a direct set prediction problem, via a global loss that enforces unique fixations prediction through bipartite matching and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. By utilizing a fixed set of learned fixation queries, the cross-attention reasons over the image features to directly output the fixation points, distinguishing it from other modern saliency predictors.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box (RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labelled point on the image, we transfer the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with the known bounding box to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm, yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives, 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets",

    "abstract": "Single point-supervised object detection is gaining attention due to its cost-effectiveness. However, existing approaches focus on generating horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) while ignoring oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) commonly used for objects in aerial images. This paper proposes PointOBB, the first single Point-based OBB generation method, for oriented object detection. PointOBB operates through the collaborative utilization of three distinctive views: an original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Upon the original view, we leverage the resized and rot/flp views to build a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module, respectively. In the former module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss is designed to enhance the deep network's ability to perceive the object scale. For accurate object angle predictions, the latter module incorporates self-supervised learning to predict angles, which is associated with a scale-guided Dense-to-Sparse (DS) matching strategy for aggregating dense angles corresponding to sparse objects. The resized and rot/flp views are switched using a progressive multi-view switching strategy during training to achieve coupled optimization of scale and angle. Experimental results on the DIOR-R and DOTA-v1.0 datasets demonstrate that PointOBB achieves promising performance, and significantly outperforms potential point-supervised baselines",

Additionally, the paper evaluates the effect of noise on the performance of pre-trained QNNs and highlights the challenges posed by noise models in quantum computing. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of quantum software, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing stability and noise-correction measures when developing QNNs to ensure reliable and trustworthy results.

    "abstract": "End users face a choice between privacy and efficiency in current Large Language Model (LLM) service paradigms. In cloud-based paradigms, users are forced to compromise data locality for generation quality and processing speed. Conversely, edge device paradigms maintain data locality but fail to deliver satisfactory performance. In this work, we propose a novel LLM service paradigm that distributes privacy-sensitive computation on edge devices and shared computation in the cloud. Only activations are transmitted between the central cloud and edge devices to ensure data locality. Our core innovation, PrivateLoRA, addresses the challenging communication overhead by exploiting the low rank of residual activations, achieving over 95% communication reduction. Consequently, PrivateLoRA effectively maintains data locality and is extremely resource efficient. Under standard 5G networks, PrivateLoRA achieves throughput over 300% of device-only solutions for 7B models and over 80% of an A100 GPU for 33B models. PrivateLoRA also provides tuning performance comparable to LoRA for advanced personalization. Our approach democratizes access to state-of-the-art generative AI for edge devices, paving the way for more tailored LLM experiences for the general public.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, and specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the standard for several tasks from specific advertising to object detection. The performance offered has led DNN algorithms to become a part of critical embedded systems, requiring both efficiency and reliability. In particular, DNNs are subject to malicious examples designed in a way to fool the network while being undetectable to the human observer: the adversarial examples. While previous studies propose frameworks to implement such attacks in black box settings, those often rely on the hypothesis that the attacker has access to the logits of the neural network, breaking the assumption of the traditional black box. In this paper, we investigate a real black box scenario where the attacker has no access to the logits. In particular, we propose an architecture-agnostic attack which solve this constraint by extracting the logits. Our method combines hardware and software attacks, by performing a side-channel attack that exploits electromagnetic leakages to extract the logits for a given input, allowing an attacker to estimate the gradients and produce state-of-the-art adversarial examples to fool the targeted neural network. Through this example of adversarial attack, we demonstrate the effectiveness of logits extraction using side-channel as a first step for more general attack frameworks requiring either the logits or the confidence scores",

In practical applications, users aspire for solutions that converge to the region of interest (ROI) along the Pareto front (PF).

Specifically, we aim to discover a method that sidesteps the need for calculating the fitness function, relying solely on human feedback. Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning facilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is structured into three sessions.

    "title": "Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning for Answering Knowledge-intensive Complex Questions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of answering knowledge-intensive complex questions with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they tend to generate factually incorrect reasoning steps when the required knowledge is not available or up-to-date in models' parameters. Recent works turn to retrieving external knowledge to augment CoT reasoning. Despite being promising, these chain-based methods suffer from: 1) Negative retrieval. Unnecessary or incorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the ability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate along the chain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query tree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node. Then, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions from leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and answering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident answer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA that employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative retrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs have broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from child nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three Complex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning",

    "title": "Cluster trajectory of SOFA score in predicting mortality in sepsis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Objective: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition. Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is commonly used to assess organ dysfunction and predict ICU mortality, but it is taken as a static measurement and fails to capture dynamic changes. This study aims to investigate the relationship between dynamic changes in SOFA scores over the first 72 hours of ICU admission and patient outcomes. Design, setting, and participants: 3,253 patients in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database who met the sepsis-3 criteria and were admitted from the emergency department with at least 72 hours of ICU admission and full-active resuscitation status were analysed. Group-based trajectory modelling with dynamic time warping and k-means clustering identified distinct trajectory patterns in dynamic SOFA scores. They were subsequently compared using Python. Main outcome measures: Outcomes including hospital and ICU mortality, length of stay in hospital and ICU, and readmission during hospital stay, were collected. Discharge time from ICU to wards and cut-offs at 7-day and 14-day were taken. Results: Four clusters were identified: A (consistently low SOFA scores), B (rapid increase followed by a decline in SOFA scores), C (higher baseline scores with gradual improvement), and D (persistently elevated scores). Cluster D had the longest ICU and hospital stays, highest ICU and hospital mortality. Discharge rates from ICU were similar for Clusters A and B, while Cluster C had initially comparable rates but a slower transition to ward. Conclusion: Monitoring dynamic changes in SOFA score is valuable for assessing sepsis severity and treatment responsiveness",

In such a framework, two neural networks compete adversely to generate new visual contents indistinguishable from the original dataset. The objective of this research is to create a complementary codesign process between humans and machines to augment character designers abilities in visualizing and creating new characters for multimedia projects such as games and animation. Driven by design cognitive scaffolding, the proposed approach aims to inform the process of perceiving, knowing, and making.

    "title": "Parameter Exchange for Robust Dynamic Domain Generalization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Agnostic domain shift is the main reason of model degradation on the unknown target domains, which brings an urgent need to develop Domain Generalization (DG). Recent advances at DG use dynamic networks to achieve training-free adaptation on the unknown target domains, termed Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), which compensates for the lack of self-adaptability in static models with fixed weights. The parameters of dynamic networks can be decoupled into a static and a dynamic component, which are designed to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features, respectively. Based on the existing arts, in this work, we try to push the limits of DDG by disentangling the static and dynamic components more thoroughly from an optimization perspective. Our main consideration is that we can enable the static component to learn domain-invariant features more comprehensively by augmenting the domain-specific information. As a result, the more comprehensive domain-invariant features learned by the static component can then enforce the dynamic component to focus more on learning adaptive domain-specific features. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Parameter Exchange (PE) method to perturb the combination between the static and dynamic components. We optimize the model using the gradients from both the perturbed and non-perturbed feed-forward jointly to implicitly achieve the aforementioned disentanglement. In this way, the two components can be optimized in a mutually-beneficial manner, which can resist the agnostic domain shifts and improve the self-adaptability on the unknown target domain. Extensive experiments show that PE can be easily plugged into existing dynamic networks to improve their generalization ability without bells and whistles",

    "abstract": "Cyclists prefer to use infrastructure that separates them from motorized traffic. Using a traffic light to segregate car and bike flows, with the addition of bike-specific green phases, is a lightweight and cheap solution that can be deployed dynamically to assess the opportunity of a heavier infrastructure such as a separate bike lane. To compensate for the increased waiting time induced by these new phases, we introduce in this paper a deep reinforcement learning solution that adapts the green phase cycle of a traffic light to the traffic. Vehicle counter data are used to compare the DRL approach with the actuated traffic light control algorithm over whole days. Results show that DRL achieves better minimization of vehicle waiting time at almost all hours. Our DRL approach is also robust to moderate changes in bike traffic.

In this paper, we propose an automatic multi-token debiasing pipeline called \\textbf{General Phrase Debiaser}, which is capable of mitigating phrase-level biases in masked language models. Specifically, our method consists of a \\textit{phrase filter stage} that generates stereotypical phrases from Wikipedia pages as well as a \\textit{model debias stage} that can debias models at the multi-token level to tackle bias challenges on phrases. The latter searches for prompts that trigger model's bias, and then uses them for debiasing.

    "title": "A Multi-solution Study on GDPR AI-enabled Completeness Checking of DPAs",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Specifying legal requirements for software systems to ensure their compliance with the applicable regulations is a major concern to requirements engineering (RE). Personal data which is collected by an organization is often shared with other organizations to perform certain processing activities. In such cases, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires issuing a data processing agreement (DPA) which regulates the processing and further ensures that personal data remains protected. Violating GDPR can lead to huge fines reaching to billions of Euros. Software systems involving personal data processing must adhere to the legal obligations stipulated in GDPR and outlined in DPAs. Requirements engineers can elicit from DPAs legal requirements for regulating the data processing activities in software systems. Checking the completeness of a DPA according to the GDPR provisions is therefore an essential prerequisite to ensure that the elicited requirements are complete. Analyzing DPAs entirely manually is time consuming and requires adequate legal expertise. In this paper, we propose an automation strategy to address the completeness checking of DPAs against GDPR. Specifically, we pursue ten alternative solutions which are enabled by different technologies, namely traditional machine learning, deep learning, language modeling, and few-shot learning. The goal of our work is to empirically examine how these different technologies fare in the legal domain. We computed F2 score on a set of 30 real DPAs. Our evaluation shows that best-performing solutions yield F2 score of 86.7% and 89.7% are based on pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa language models. Our analysis further shows that other alternative solutions based on deep learning (e.g., BiLSTM) and few-shot learning (e.g., SetFit) can achieve comparable accuracy, yet are more efficient to develop",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used in critical fields such as healthcare, education, and finance due to their remarkable proficiency in various language-related tasks. However, LLMs are prone to generating factually incorrect responses or \"hallucinations,\" which can lead to a loss of credibility and trust among users. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage framework that generates the rationale first, verifies and refines incorrect ones, and uses them as supporting references to generate the answer. The generated rationale enhances the transparency of the answer and our framework provides insights into how the model arrived at this answer, by using this rationale and the references to the context. In this paper, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the quality of responses to drug-related inquiries in the life sciences industry. Our framework improves traditional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by enabling OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to be 14-25% more faithful and 16-22% more accurate on two datasets. Furthermore, fine-tuning samples based on our framework improves the accuracy of smaller open-access LLMs by 33-42% and competes with RAG on commercial models",

Developing compliant software depends heavily on addressing legal requirements stipulated in applicable regulations, a central activity in the requirements engineering (RE) phase of the software development process. RE is concerned with specifying and maintaining requirements of a system-to-be, including legal requirements. Legal agreements which describe the policies organizations implement for processing personal data can provide an additional source to regulations for eliciting legal requirements.

A wealth of relevant, untapped Mental Health (MH) data is available in online communities, providing the opportunity to address the explainability problem with substantial potential impact as a screening tool for both online and offline applications. We develop a method to enhance attention in popular transformer models and generate clinician-understandable explanations for classification by incorporating external clinical knowledge. Inspired by how clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage relevant clinical knowledge to model patient inputs, providing meaningful explanations for classification. This will save manual review time and engender trust. We develop such a system in the context of MH using clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for diagnosing depression, a mental health disorder of global concern. We propose an application-specific language model called ProcesS knowledge-infused cross ATtention (PSAT), which incorporates CPGs when computing attention. Through rigorous evaluation on three expert-curated datasets related to depression, we demonstrate application-relevant explainability of PSAT. PSAT also surpasses the performance of nine baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. We transform a CPG resource focused on depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (e.g. PHQ-9) and related questions, into a machine-readable ontology using SNOMED-CT. With this resource, PSAT enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of architected materials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab-based trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental data. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity.

This system converts images into textual representations and reconstructs them into quality-acceptable images, optimizing transmission for vehicular network semantic communication. Moreover, when bandwidth allows, auxiliary information is integrated. The encoder-decoder aims to maintain semantic equivalence with the original images across various tasks. Then the proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance the reliability of the generated contents. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method surpasses the baseline in perceiving vehicles in blind spots and effectively compresses communication data.

However, the field of 3D medical image retrieval is still emerging, lacking established evaluation benchmarks, comprehensive datasets, and thorough studies. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a novel benchmark for 3D Medical Image Retrieval (3D-MIR) that encompasses four different anatomies imaged with computed tomography. Using this benchmark, we explore a diverse set of search strategies that use aggregated 2D slices, 3D volumes, and multi-modal embeddings from popular multi-modal foundation models as queries. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of each approach are provided alongside an in-depth discussion that offers insight for future research.

Model Extraction Attacks are aimed at reverse-engineering a trained deep learning model, with the primary objective of revealing its architecture and parameters. Model inversion attacks aim to compromise the privacy of the data used in the Deep learning model. These attacks are done to compromise the confidentiality of the model by going through the sensitive training data from the model's predictions. By analyzing the model's responses, attackers aim to reconstruct sensitive information. In this way, the model's data privacy is compromised. Adversarial attacks, mainly employed on computer vision models, are made to corrupt models into confidently making incorrect predictions through malicious testing data. These attacks subtly alter the input data, making it look normal but misleading deep learning models to make incorrect decisions. Such attacks can happen during both the model's evaluation and training phases. Data Poisoning Attacks add harmful data to the training set, disrupting the learning process and reducing the reliability of the deep learning mode",

    "title": "OASIS: Offsetting Active Reconstruction Attacks in Federated Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has garnered significant attention for its potential to protect user privacy while enhancing model training efficiency. However, recent research has demonstrated that FL protocols can be easily compromised by active reconstruction attacks executed by dishonest servers. These attacks involve the malicious modification of global model parameters, allowing the server to obtain a verbatim copy of users' private data by inverting their gradient updates. Tackling this class of attack remains a crucial challenge due to the strong threat model. In this paper, we propose OASIS, a defense mechanism based on image augmentation that effectively counteracts active reconstruction attacks while preserving model performance. We first uncover the core principle of gradient inversion that enables these attacks and theoretically identify the main conditions by which the defense can be robust regardless of the attack strategies. We then construct OASIS with image augmentation showing that it can undermine the attack principle. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of OASIS highlighting its feasibility as a solution",

It is further outlined, that inversion through deep learning provides a clear efficiency and usability advantage compared to regularization techniques such as Tikhonov and modified total generalized variation (MTGV), because no hyperparemeter selection prior to reconstruction is necessary. The inversion network is applied to simulated NMR signals and the results compared with Tikhonov- and MTGV-regularization. The comparison shows that inversion via deep learning is significantly faster than the latter regularization methods and also outperforms both regularization techniques in nearly all instances",

    "abstract": "High-quality labels are often very scarce, whereas unlabeled data with inferred weak labels occurs more naturally. In many cases, these weak labels dictate the frequency of each respective class over a set of instances. In this paper, we develop a unified approach to learning from such weakly-labeled data, which we call count-based weakly-supervised learning. At the heart of our approach is the ability to compute the probability of exactly k out of n outputs being set to true. This computation is differentiable, exact, and efficient. Building upon the previous computation, we derive a count loss penalizing the model for deviations in its distribution from an arithmetic constraint defined over label counts. We evaluate our approach on three common weakly-supervised learning paradigms and observe that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results across all three of the paradigms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This study employs Bayesian methodologies to explore the influence of player or positional factors in predicting the probability of a shot resulting in a goal, measured by the expected goals (xG) metric. Utilising publicly available data from StatsBomb, Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions are constructed, analysing approximately 10,000 shots from the English Premier League to ascertain whether positional or player-level effects impact xG. The findings reveal positional effects in a basic model that includes only distance to goal and shot angle as predictors, highlighting that strikers and attacking midfielders exhibit a higher likelihood of scoring. However, these effects diminish when more informative predictors are introduced. Nevertheless, even with additional predictors, player-level effects persist, indicating that certain players possess notable positive or negative xG adjustments, influencing their likelihood of scoring a given chance. The study extends its analysis to data from Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga, yielding comparable results. Additionally, the paper assesses the impact of prior distribution choices on outcomes, concluding that the priors employed in the models provide sound results but could be refined to enhance sampling efficiency for constructing more complex and extensive models feasibly",

However, the application of tensor decomposition is largely hindered by the exponential increment of the computational complexity and storage consumption with the size of tensors. While the data in our real world is usually presented as trillion- or even exascale-scale tensors, existing work can only support billion-scale scale tensors. In our work, we propose the Exascale-Tensor to mitigate the significant gap. Specifically, we propose a compression-based tensor decomposition framework, namely the exascale-tensor, to support exascale tensor decomposition. Then, we carefully analyze the inherent parallelism and propose a bag of strategies to improve computational efficiency. Last, we conduct experiments to decompose tensors ranging from million-scale to trillion-scale for evaluation. Compared to the baselines, the exascale-tensor supports 8,000x larger tensors and a speedup up to 6.95x.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The classic metaphyseal lesion (CML) is a distinct injury that is highly specific for infant abuse. It commonly occurs in the distal tibia. To aid radiologists detect these subtle fractures, we need to develop a model that can flag abnormal distal tibial radiographs (i.e. those with CMLs). Unfortunately, the development of such a model requires a large and diverse training database, which is often not available. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative model for data augmentation. Unlike previous models that fail to generate data that span the diverse radiographic appearance of the distal tibial CML, our proposed masked conditional diffusion model (MaC-DM) not only generates realistic-appearing and wide-ranging synthetic images of the distal tibial radiographs with and without CMLs, it also generates their associated segmentation labels. To achieve these tasks, MaC-DM combines the weighted segmentation masks of the tibias and the CML fracture sites as additional conditions for classifier guidance. The augmented images from our model improved the performances of ResNet-34 in classifying normal radiographs and those with CMLs. Further, the augmented images and their associated segmentation masks enhanced the performance of the U-Net in labeling areas of the CMLs on distal tibial radiographs",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel clustered FL framework that enables distributed edge devices with non-IID data to independently form several clusters in a distributed manner and implement FL training within each cluster is proposed. In particular, our designed clustered FL algorithm must overcome two challenges associated with FL training. First, the server has limited FL training information (i.e., the parameter server can only obtain the FL model information of each device) and limited computational power for finding the differences among a large amount of devices. Second, each device does not have the data information of other devices for device clustering and can only use global FL model parameters received from the server and its data information to determine its cluster identity, which will increase the difficulty of device clustering. To overcome these two challenges, we propose a joint gradient and loss based distributed clustering method in which each device determines its cluster identity considering the gradient similarity and training loss. The proposed clustering method not only considers how a local FL model of one device contributes to each cluster but also the direction of gradient descent thus improving clustering speed. By delegating clustering decisions to edge devices, each device can fully leverage its private data information to determine its own cluster identity, thereby reducing clustering overhead and improving overall clustering performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed clustered FL algorithm can reduce clustering iterations by up to 99% compared to the existing baseline",

By injecting Gaussian noise into the PC inference procedure we re-envision it as an overdamped Langevin sampling, which facilitates optimisation with respect to a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO). We improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and test three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness to the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a lightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique against those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs.

Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%.

    "abstract": "In-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) has become a prevalent approach to improve zero-shot capabilities, but this idea is less explored in the vision domain. Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets.

This lower bound is in fact minimax optimal and is achieved by a natural quasi MLE. However, this estimator involves a search over all permutations which is computationally infeasible even when the problem has moderate size. To overcome this limitation, we show that the celebrated Gromov-Wasserstein algorithm from optimal transport which is more amenable to fast implementation even on large-scale problems is also minimax optimal.

In contrast to prior work, INVERT is capable of handling diverse types of neurons, exhibits less computational complexity, and does not rely on the availability of segmentation masks. Moreover, INVERT provides an interpretable metric assessing the alignment between the representation and its corresponding explanation and delivering a measure of statistical significance, emphasizing its utility and credibility.

To mitigate this prospect, we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment.

    "title": "Risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process and Learning under General Utility Functions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations. Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework. Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration. In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward. We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design. We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward. When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity.

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Generative AI, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing have led to an increased integration of AI models into various products. This widespread adoption of AI requires significant efforts in deploying these models in production environments. When hosting machine learning models for real-time predictions, it is important to meet defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs), ensuring reliability, minimal downtime, and optimizing operational costs of the underlying infrastructure. Large machine learning models often demand GPU resources for efficient inference to meet SLOs. In the context of these trends, there is growing interest in hosting AI models in a serverless architecture while still providing GPU access for inference tasks. This survey aims to summarize and categorize the emerging challenges and optimization opportunities for large-scale deep learning serving systems. By providing a novel taxonomy and summarizing recent trends, we hope that this survey could shed light on new optimization perspectives and motivate novel works in large-scale deep learning serving systems",

    "abstract": "We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly logconcave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm. Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Data sampling is an effective method to improve the training speed of neural networks, with recent results demonstrating that it can even break the neural scaling laws. These results critically rely on high-quality scores to estimate the importance of an input to the network. We observe that there are two dominant strategies: static sampling, where the scores are determined before training, and dynamic sampling, where the scores can depend on the model weights. Static algorithms are computationally inexpensive but less effective than their dynamic counterparts, which can cause end-to-end slowdown due to their need to explicitly compute losses. To address this problem, we propose a novel sampling distribution based on nonparametric kernel regression that learns an effective importance score as the neural network trains. However, nonparametric regression models are too computationally expensive to accelerate end-to-end training. Therefore, we develop an efficient sketch-based approximation to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Using recent techniques from high-dimensional statistics and randomized algorithms, we prove that our Nadaraya-Watson sketch approximates the estimator with exponential convergence guarantees. Our sampling algorithm outperforms the baseline in terms of wall-clock time and accuracy on four datasets",

    "title": "$σ$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear principal component analysis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Linear principal component analysis (PCA), nonlinear PCA, and linear independent component analysis (ICA) -- those are three methods with single-layer autoencoder formulations for learning linear transformations from data. Linear PCA learns orthogonal transformations (rotations) that orient axes to maximise variance, but it suffers from a subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to find a unique rotation for axes that share the same variance. Both nonlinear PCA and linear ICA reduce the subspace indeterminacy from rotational to permutational by maximising statistical independence under the assumption of unit variance. The main difference between them is that nonlinear PCA only learns rotations while linear ICA learns not just rotations but any linear transformation with unit variance. The relationship between all three can be understood by the singular value decomposition of the linear ICA transformation into a sequence of rotation, scale, rotation. Linear PCA learns the first rotation; nonlinear PCA learns the second. The scale is simply the inverse of the standard deviations. The problem is that, in contrast to linear PCA, conventional nonlinear PCA cannot be used directly on the data to learn the first rotation, the first being special as it reduces dimensionality and orders by variances. In this paper, we have identified the cause, and as a solution we propose $\\sigma$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear PCA as single-layer autoencoders. One of its key ingredients: modelling not just the rotation but also the scale -- the variances. This model bridges the disparity between linear and nonlinear PCA. And so, like linear PCA, it can learn a semi-orthogonal transformation that reduces dimensionality and orders by variances, but, unlike linear PCA, it does not suffer from rotational indeterminacy",

Similar to classical machine learning, an exact form of a quantum kernel is expected to have a great impact on the model performance. In this work we combine all trace-induced quantum kernels, including the commonly-used global fidelity and local projected quantum kernels, into a common framework. We show how generalized trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the fundamental building blocks we coin \"Lego\" kernels, which impose an inductive bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement shots. We show numerically that models based on local projected kernels can achieve comparable performance to the global fidelity quantum kernel.

    "abstract": "In this work we consider the problem of numerical integration, i.e., approximating integrals with respect to a target probability measure using only pointwise evaluations of the integrand. We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m<n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution. As a consequence, direct applications of our results also include the efficient computation of maximum mean discrepancies between distributions and the design of efficient kernel-based tests",

Specifically, we consider a nested sequences of function subspaces $\\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_L$, where $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ is a family of functions spanned by B-spline basis functions of order $p$, $f_l^*$ is the projection of $f$ on $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ and encoded as low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$, and $g_l^*$ is the residual function in orthogonal subspace $\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)}$ (where $\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)} \\oplus \\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)} = \\mathcal{F}_{l+1}^{(p)}$) and encoded as high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$.

For the prediction, we formalize RAHT(1) linear prediction in MPEG-PCC in a theoretical framework, and propose a new nonlinear predictor using a polynomial of bilateral filter. We derive equations to efficiently compute the critically sampled high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$ amenable to encoding.

    "title": "Speak Like a Native: Prompting Large Language Models in a Native Style",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs). Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps. In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans. However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \\textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs. ``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios. AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples. For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the current landscape of large models, the Transformer stands as a cornerstone, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern models. However, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial computational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its reliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles, particularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing environments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices and a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions. To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we introduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer paradigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that adeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise operations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does it maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range information dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the computational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition from an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an $O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this advantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller than the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$. The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable requirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge computing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between high-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a promising trajectory for further advancements in the field",

Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements.

    "abstract": "Formality plays a significant role in language communication, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages utilise formal and informal expressions to convey messages based on social contexts and relationships. When a language translation technique is used to translate from a source language that does not pertain the formality (e.g. English) to a target language that does, there is a missing information on formality that could be a challenge in producing an accurate outcome. This research explores how this issue should be resolved when machine learning methods are used to translate from English to languages with formality, using Hindi as the example data. This was done by training a bilingual model in a formality-controlled setting and comparing its performance with a pre-trained multilingual model in a similar setting. Since there are not a lot of training data with ground truth, automated annotation techniques were employed to increase the data size. The primary modeling approach involved leveraging transformer models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the official formality accuracy(ACC) by comparing the predicted masked tokens with the ground truth. This metric provides a quantitative measure of how well the translations align with the desired outputs.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study the sample complexity of learning an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy in an average-reward Markov decision process (MDP) under a generative model. We establish the complexity bound $\\widetilde{O}\\left(SA\\frac{H}{\\varepsilon^2} \\right)$, where $H$ is the span of the bias function of the optimal policy and $SA$ is the cardinality of the state-action space. Our result is the first that is minimax optimal (up to log factors) in all parameters $S,A,H$ and $\\varepsilon$, improving on existing work that either assumes uniformly bounded mixing times for all policies or has suboptimal dependence on the parameters. Our result is based on reducing the average-reward MDP to a discounted MDP. To establish the optimality of this reduction, we develop improved bounds for $\\gamma$-discounted MDPs, showing that $\\widetilde{O}\\left(SA\\frac{H}{(1-\\gamma)^2\\varepsilon^2} \\right)$ samples suffice to learn a $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy in weakly communicating MDPs under the regime that $\\gamma \\geq 1 - \\frac{1}{H}$, circumventing the well-known lower bound of $\\widetilde{\\Omega}\\left(SA\\frac{1}{(1-\\gamma)^3\\varepsilon^2} \\right)$ for general $\\gamma$-discounted MDPs.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for addressing problems in structural biology and structure-based drug design. These models operate directly on 3D molecular structures. Due to the unfavorable scaling of graph neural networks (GNNs) with graph size as well as the relatively slow inference speeds inherent to diffusion models, many existing molecular diffusion models rely on coarse-grained representations of protein structure to make training and inference feasible. However, such coarse-grained representations discard essential information for modeling molecular interactions and impair the quality of generated structures. In this work, we present a novel GNN-based architecture for learning latent representations of molecular structure. When trained end-to-end with a diffusion model for de novo ligand design, our model achieves comparable performance to one with an all-atom protein representation while exhibiting a 3-fold reduction in inference time",

    "abstract": "There are a lot of real-world black-box optimization problems that need to optimize multiple criteria simultaneously. However, in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, identifying the whole Pareto front requires the prohibitive search cost, while in many practical scenarios, the decision maker (DM) only needs a specific solution among the set of the Pareto optimal solutions. We propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to identifying the most preferred solution in the MOO with expensive objective functions, in which a Bayesian preference model of the DM is adaptively estimated by an interactive manner based on the two types of supervisions called the pairwise preference and improvement request. To explore the most preferred solution, we define an acquisition function in which the uncertainty both in the objective functions and the DM preference is incorporated. Further, to minimize the interaction cost with the DM, we also propose an active learning strategy for the preference estimation. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method through the benchmark function optimization and the hyper-parameter optimization problems for machine learning models",

Calculus on TEMs relies on a deformed algebra of arithmetic operators induced by the deformed logarithms used to define the tempered entropy. In this work, we introduce three different parameterizations of finite discrete TEMs via Legendre functions of the negative tempered entropy function. In particular, we establish an isometry between such parameterizations in terms of a generalization of the Hilbert log cross-ratio simplex distance to a tempered Hilbert co-simplex distance. Similar to the Hilbert geometry, the tempered Hilbert distance is characterized as a $t$-symmetrization of the oriented tempered Funk distance. We motivate our construction by introducing the notion of $t$-lengths of smooth curves in a tautological Finsler manifold. We then demonstrate the properties of our generalized structure in different settings and numerically examine the quality of its differentiable approximations for optimization in machine learning settings",

The Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) condition is a special case of this condition when $\\kappa=2$. Specifically, we study this problem under the constraint of $\\rho$ zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). When $\\kappa\\in[1,2]$ and the loss function is Lipschitz and smooth over a sufficiently large region, we provide a new algorithm based on variance reduced gradient descent that achieves the rate $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^\\kappa\\big)$ on the excess empirical risk, where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension.

    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as code2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, such as the inclusion of \"dead code\" through false conditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to \"fool\" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of adversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code models, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such adversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based defenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information such as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for reversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial examples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening the LLMs' performance. The proposed defenses show promise in improving the model's resilience, paving the way to more robust defensive solutions for LLMs in code-related applications",

In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strain histories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source task and cyclic loading conditions as the target task. Incorporating sub-scale properties enhances RNN versatility. In order to achieve accurate predictions, the model uses a grid search method to tune network architecture and hyper-parameter configurations.

It requires detailed models of complex conditional probability distributions - it is generally a difficult task, but here can be done through multiple dependency reducing iterations, using imperfect methods (here HCR: Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction). It could be also used for direct mutual information - evaluating direct information transfer: without use of intermediate variables. For causality direction there is discussed multi-feature Granger causality, e.g. to trace various types of individual information transfers between such decoupled variables, including propagation time (delay)",

    "abstract": "The gameplay of strategic board games such as chess, Go and Hex is often characterized by combinatorial, relational structures -- capturing distinct interactions and non-local patterns -- and not just images. Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models, not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS use structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieve computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) leveraging simple math to re-arrange the order of operations in REDS computational graph to take advantage of the data cache. REDS support conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provide computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on six benchmark architectures trained on the Google Speech Commands, FMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence for REDS outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\\mu$s, utilizing a 2-layer fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense",

    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular technique for edge AI to mine valuable knowledge in edge computing (EC) systems. To mitigate the computing/communication burden on resource-constrained workers and protect model privacy, split federated learning (SFL) has been released by integrating both data and model parallelism. Despite resource limitations, SFL still faces two other critical challenges in EC, i.e., statistical heterogeneity and system heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SFL framework, termed MergeSFL, by incorporating feature merging and batch size regulation in SFL. Concretely, feature merging aims to merge the features from workers into a mixed feature sequence, which is approximately equivalent to the features derived from IID data and is employed to promote model accuracy. While batch size regulation aims to assign diverse and suitable batch sizes for heterogeneous workers to improve training efficiency. Moreover, MergeSFL explores to jointly optimize these two strategies upon their coupled relationship to better enhance the performance of SFL. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical platform with 80 NVIDIA Jetson edge devices, and the experimental results show that MergeSFL can improve the final model accuracy by 5.82% to 26.22%, with a speedup by about 1.74x to 4.14x, compared to the baselines",

We not only derived this principle, but also mentioned its application to actual machine learning models. For example, we found that conventional supervised learning is equivalent to estimating conditional probabilities, and succeeded in making supervised learning more effective and generalized. We also proposed a new method of defining the values of estimated probability using differentiation, and showed that unsupervised learning can be performed on arbitrary dataset without any prior knowledge. Namely, this method is a general-purpose machine learning in the true sense. Moreover, we succeeded in describing the learning mechanism in the brain by considering the time evolution of a fully or partially connected model and applying this new method. The learning principle provides solutions to many unsolved problems in deep learning and cognitive neuroscience",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Curriculum learning and imitation learning have been leveraged extensively in the robotics domain. However, minimal research has been done on leveraging these ideas on control tasks over highly stochastic time-series data. Here, we theoretically and empirically explore these approaches in a representative control task over complex time-series data. We implement the fundamental ideas of curriculum learning via data augmentation, while imitation learning is implemented via policy distillation from an oracle. Our findings reveal that curriculum learning should be considered a novel direction in improving control-task performance over complex time-series. Our ample random-seed out-sample empirics and ablation studies are highly encouraging for curriculum learning for time-series control. These findings are especially encouraging as we tune all overlapping hyperparameters on the baseline -- giving an advantage to the baseline. On the other hand, we find that imitation learning should be used with caution",

While most research has centered on supervised continual learning, recent studies have highlighted the strengths of self-supervised continual representation learning. The improved transferability of representations built with self-supervised methods is often associated with the role played by the multi-layer perceptron projector. In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning. We reckon that additional information, such as human annotations, should not deteriorate the quality of representations. Our findings show that supervised models when enhanced with a multi-layer perceptron head, can outperform self-supervised models in continual representation learning",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automated blood vessel segmentation is vital for biomedical imaging, as vessel changes indicate many pathologies. Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

    "abstract": "A popular perspective in Reinforcement learning (RL) casts the problem as probabilistic inference on a graphical model of the Markov decision process (MDP). The core object of study is the probability of each state-action pair being visited under the optimal policy. Previous approaches to approximate this quantity can be arbitrarily poor, leading to algorithms that do not implement genuine statistical inference and consequently do not perform well in challenging problems. In this work, we undertake a rigorous Bayesian treatment of the posterior probability of state-action optimality and clarify how it flows through the MDP. We first reveal that this quantity can indeed be used to generate a policy that explores efficiently, as measured by regret. Unfortunately, computing it is intractable, so we derive a new variational Bayesian approximation yielding a tractable convex optimization problem and establish that the resulting policy also explores efficiently. We call our approach VAPOR and show that it has strong connections to Thompson sampling, K-learning, and maximum entropy exploration. We conclude with some experiments demonstrating the performance advantage of a deep RL version of VAPOR",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hydropower plants are crucial for stable renewable energy and serve as vital water sources for sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation. This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts",

    "abstract": "Unlike the more commonly analyzed ECG or PPG data for activity classification, heart rate time series data is less detailed, often noisier and can contain missing data points. Using the BigIdeasLab_STEP dataset, which includes heart rate time series annotated with specific tasks performed by individuals, we sought to determine if general classification was achievable. Our analyses showed that the accuracy is sensitive to the choice of window/stride size. Moreover, we found variable classification performances between subjects due to differences in the physical structure of their hearts. Various techniques were used to minimize this variability. First of all, normalization proved to be a crucial step and significantly improved the performance. Secondly, grouping subjects and performing classification inside a group helped to improve performance and decrease inter-subject variability. Finally, we show that including handcrafted features as input to a deep learning (DL) network improves the classification performance further. Together, these findings indicate that heart rate time series can be utilized for classification tasks like predicting activity. However, normalization or grouping techniques need to be chosen carefully to minimize the issue of subject variability",

This approach poses a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals and organizations alike. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the gradient leakage method when applied specifically to transformer-based models. Through meticulous examination, we showcase the capability to accurately recover data solely from gradients and rigorously investigate the conditions under which gradient attacks can be executed, providing compelling evidence.

To address this, we outline a theoretical proof that analyzes the associated privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Additionally, we affirm the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm under perturbed gradients. The primary objective of this study is to augment the understanding of gradient leakage attack and defense strategies while actively contributing to the development of privacy-preserving techniques specifically tailored for transformer-based models. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with gradient leakage, this research aims to foster advancements in safeguarding sensitive data and upholding privacy in the context of transformer-based models",

These factors, which take up a large proportion of training time, make data management in GNN training more significant. This paper reviews GNN training from a data management perspective and provides a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the representative approaches.

However, FL encounters challenges related to data heterogeneity, which can result in performance degradation. In our study, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, feature representation in the FedAVG model deteriorates more significantly compared to classifier weight. Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Averaging with Feature Normalization Update (FedFN), a straightforward learning method. We demonstrate the superior performance of FedFN through extensive experiments, even when applied to pretrained ResNet18. Subsequently, we confirm the applicability of FedFN to foundation models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the field of equation learning, exhaustively considering all possible equations derived from a basis function dictionary is infeasible. Sparse regression and greedy algorithms have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this challenge. However, the presence of multicollinearity poses difficulties for sparse regression techniques, and greedy steps may inadvertently exclude terms of the true equation, leading to reduced identification accuracy. In this article, we present an approach that strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency in equation learning. Inspired by stepwise regression, our approach combines the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, and the Bayesian model evidence, $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$, in a novel way. Our procedure is characterized by a comprehensive search with just a minor reduction of the model space at each iteration step. With two flavors of our approach and the adoption of $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$ for bi-directional stepwise regression, we present a total of three new avenues for equation learning. Through three extensive numerical experiments involving random polynomials and dynamical systems, we compare our approach against four state-of-the-art methods and two standard approaches. The results demonstrate that our comprehensive search approach surpasses all other methods in terms of identification accuracy. In particular, the second flavor of our approach establishes an efficient overfitting penalty solely based on $R^2$, which achieves highest rates of exact equation recovery",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenges of online Continual Learning (CL) by introducing a density distribution-based learning framework. CL, especially the Class Incremental Learning, enables adaptation to new test distributions while continuously learning from a single-pass training data stream, which is more in line with the practical application requirements of real-world scenarios. However, existing CL methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and higher computing costs due to complex algorithm designs, limiting their practical use. Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by achieving superior average accuracy and time-space efficiency, bridging the performance gap between CL and classical machine learning. Specifically, we adopt an independent Generative Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE) model for each CL task. During the testing stage, the GKDEs utilize a self-reported max probability density value to determine which one is responsible for predicting incoming test instances. A GKDE-based learning objective can ensure that samples with the same label are grouped together, while dissimilar instances are pushed farther apart. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple CL datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our method outperforms popular CL approaches by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive time-space efficiency, making our framework suitable for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA$^2$ in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Our code will be made publicly available",

    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various applications. Existing frameworks utilize CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments to train GNN models and integrate mini-batch and sampling techniques to overcome the GPU memory limitation. In CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments, we can divide sample-based GNN training into three steps: sample, gather, and train. Existing GNN systems use different task orchestrating methods to employ each step on CPU or GPU. After extensive experiments and analysis, we find that existing task orchestrating methods fail to fully utilize the heterogeneous resources, limited by inefficient CPU processing or GPU resource contention. In this paper, we propose NeutronOrch, a system for sample-based GNN training that incorporates a layer-based task orchestrating method and ensures balanced utilization of the CPU and GPU. NeutronOrch decouples the training process by layer and pushes down the training task of the bottom layer to the CPU. This significantly reduces the computational load and memory footprint of GPU training. To avoid inefficient CPU processing, NeutronOrch only offloads the training of frequently accessed vertices to the CPU and lets GPU reuse their embeddings with bounded staleness. Furthermore, NeutronOrch provides a fine-grained pipeline design for the layer-based task orchestrating method, fully overlapping different tasks on heterogeneous resources while strictly guaranteeing bounded staleness. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GNN systems, NeutronOrch can achieve up to 4.61x performance speedup",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a promising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three) to generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account the sequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems often depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially low relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance at the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show that our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two real-world datasets across ten different domains",

    "title": "AS-LLM: When Algorithm Selection Meets Large Language Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Algorithm selection aims to identify the most suitable algorithm for solving a specific problem before execution, which has become a critical process of the AutoML. Current mainstream algorithm selection techniques rely heavily on feature representations of various problems and employ the performance of each algorithm as supervised information. However, there is a significant research gap concerning the consideration of algorithm features. This gap is primarily attributed to the inherent complexity of algorithms, making it particularly challenging to find a universally effective feature extraction method that is applicable across a diverse range of algorithms. Unfortunately, neglecting this aspect undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of algorithm selection and indirectly necessitates an increased volume of problem data for training purposes. This paper takes a significant stride towards addressing this gap by proposing an approach that integrates algorithm representation into the algorithm selection process. Specifically, our proposed model employs distinct modules to extract representations of both problems and algorithms, where the algorithm representation leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in the realm of code comprehension. Following the extraction of embedding vectors for both algorithms and problems, the most suitable algorithm is determined through calculations of matching degrees. Our experiments not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also showcase the performance of different embedded pre-trained LLMs, which suggests that the proposed algorithm selection framework holds the potential to serve as a baseline task for evaluating the code representation capabilities of LLMs",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study high-dimensional multi-armed contextual bandits with batched feedback where the $T$ steps of online interactions are divided into $L$ batches. In specific, each batch collects data according to a policy that depends on previous batches and the rewards are revealed only at the end of the batch. Such a feedback structure is popular in applications such as personalized medicine and online advertisement, where the online data often do not arrive in a fully serial manner. We consider high-dimensional and linear settings where the reward function of the bandit model admits either a sparse or low-rank structure and ask how small a number of batches are needed for a comparable performance with fully dynamic data in which $L = T$. For these settings, we design a provably sample-efficient algorithm which achieves a $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(s_0^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the sparse case and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O} ( r ^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the low-rank case, using only $L = \\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches. Here $s_0$ and $r$ are the sparsity and rank of the reward parameter in sparse and low-rank cases, respectively, and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(\\cdot)$ omits logarithmic factors involving the feature dimensions. In other words, our algorithm achieves regret bounds comparable to those in fully sequential setting with only $\\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches. Our algorithm features a novel batch allocation method that adjusts the batch sizes according to the estimation accuracy within each batch and cumulative regret. Furthermore, we also conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data to validate our theory",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create \"expert\" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has become a widely used tool for automating neural network design. While one-shot NAS methods have successfully reduced computational requirements, they often require extensive training. On the other hand, zero-shot NAS utilizes training-free proxies to evaluate a candidate architecture's test performance but has two limitations: (1) inability to use the information gained as a network improves with training and (2) unreliable performance, particularly in complex domains like RecSys, due to the multi-modal data inputs and complex architecture configurations. To synthesize the benefits of both methods, we introduce a \"sub-one-shot\" paradigm that serves as a bridge between zero-shot and one-shot NAS. In sub-one-shot NAS, the supernet is trained using only a small subset of the training data, a phase we refer to as \"warm-up.\" Within this framework, we present SiGeo, a proxy founded on a novel theoretical framework that connects the supernet warm-up with the efficacy of the proxy. Extensive experiments have shown that SiGeo, with the benefit of warm-up, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS proxies on various established NAS benchmarks. When a supernet is warmed up, it can achieve comparable performance to weight-sharing one-shot NAS methods, but with a significant reduction ($\\sim 60$\\%) in computational costs",

    "abstract": "We investigate the statistical task of closeness (or equivalence) testing for multidimensional distributions. Specifically, given sample access to two unknown distributions $\\mathbf p, \\mathbf q$ on $\\mathbb R^d$, we want to distinguish between the case that $\\mathbf p=\\mathbf q$ versus $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k} > \\epsilon$, where $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k}$ denotes the generalized ${A}_k$ distance between $\\mathbf p$ and $\\mathbf q$ -- measuring the maximum discrepancy between the distributions over any collection of $k$ disjoint, axis-aligned rectangles. Our main result is the first closeness tester for this problem with {\\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. In more detail, we provide a computationally efficient closeness tester with sample complexity $O\\left((k^{6/7}/ \\mathrm{poly}_d(\\epsilon)) \\log^d(k)\\right)$. On the lower bound side, we establish a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(k^{6/7}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$, even for $d=2$. These sample complexity bounds are surprising because the sample complexity of the problem in the univariate setting is $\\Theta(k^{4/5}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$. This has the interesting consequence that the jump from one to two dimensions leads to a substantial increase in sample complexity, while increases beyond that do not. As a corollary of our general $A_k$ tester, we obtain $d_{\\mathrm TV}$-closeness testers for pairs of $k$-histograms on $\\mathbb R^d$ over a common unknown partition, and pairs of uniform distributions supported on the union of $k$ unknown disjoint axis-aligned rectangles.

Our main idea is to reduce OT to a small optimization problem that has significantly fewer variables by utilizing cyclic symmetry and various optimization techniques. On the basis of this reduction, our algorithms solve the small optimization problem instead of the original OT. As a result, our algorithms obtain the optimal solution and the objective function value of the original OT faster than solving the original OT directly. In this paper, our focus is on two crucial OT formulations: the linear programming OT (LOT) and the strongly convex-regularized OT, which includes the well-known entropy-regularized OT (EROT). Experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithms for LOT and EROT in synthetic/real-world data that has a strict/approximate cyclic symmetry structure.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%",

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider a nonconvex unconstrained optimization problem minimizing a twice differentiable objective function with H\\\"older continuous Hessian. Specifically, we first propose a Newton-conjugate gradient (Newton-CG) method for finding an approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP) of this problem, assuming the associated the H\\\"older parameters are explicitly known. Then we develop a parameter-free Newton-CG method without requiring any prior knowledge of these parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this method is the first parameter-free second-order method achieving the best-known iteration and operation complexity for finding an approximate FOSP of this problem. Furthermore, we propose a Newton-CG method for finding an approximate second-order stationary point (SOSP) of the considered problem with high probability and establish its iteration and operation complexity. Finally, we present preliminary numerical results to demonstrate the superior practical performance of our parameter-free Newton-CG method over a well-known regularized Newton method",

    "title": "Stable Unlearnable Example: Enhancing the Robustness of Unlearnable Examples via Stable Error-Minimizing Noise",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "title": "Predict-Then-Optimize by Proxy: Learning Joint Models of Prediction and Optimization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Many real-world decision processes are modeled by optimization problems whose defining parameters are unknown and must be inferred from observable data. The Predict-Then-Optimize framework uses machine learning models to predict unknown parameters of an optimization problem from features before solving. Recent works show that decision quality can be improved in this setting by solving and differentiating the optimization problem in the training loop, enabling end-to-end training with loss functions defined directly on the resulting decisions. However, this approach can be inefficient and requires handcrafted, problem-specific rules for backpropagation through the optimization step. This paper proposes an alternative method, in which optimal solutions are learned directly from the observable features by predictive models. The approach is generic, and based on an adaptation of the Learning-to-Optimize paradigm, from which a rich variety of existing techniques can be employed. Experimental evaluations show the ability of several Learning-to-Optimize methods to provide efficient, accurate, and flexible solutions to an array of challenging Predict-Then-Optimize problems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Learning-based methods, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), hold great promise for streamlining deployment, enhancing performance, and achieving generalization in the control of autonomous multirotor aerial vehicles. Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU. The fast training times and deployment to a cheap, off-the-shelf quadrotor lower the barriers to entry and help democratize the research and development of these systems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers, central to the successes in modern Natural Language Processing, often falter on arithmetic tasks despite their vast capabilities --which paradoxically include remarkable coding abilities. We observe that a crucial challenge is their naive reliance on positional information to solve arithmetic problems with a small number of digits, leading to poor performance on larger numbers. Herein, we delve deeper into the role of positional encoding, and propose several ways to fix the issue, either by modifying the positional encoding directly, or by modifying the representation of the arithmetic task to leverage standard positional encoding differently. We investigate the value of these modifications for three tasks: (i) classical multiplication, (ii) length extrapolation in addition, and (iii) addition in natural language context. For (i) we train a small model on a small dataset (100M parameters and 300k samples) with remarkable aptitude in (direct, no scratchpad) 15 digits multiplication and essentially perfect up to 12 digits, while usual training in this context would give a model failing at 4 digits multiplication. In the experiments on addition, we use a mere 120k samples to demonstrate: for (ii) extrapolation from 10 digits to testing on 12 digits numbers while usual training would have no extrapolation, and for (iii) almost perfect accuracy up to 5 digits while usual training would be correct only up to 3 digits (which is essentially memorization with a training set of 120k samples)",

    "abstract": "Multimedia generation approaches occupy a prominent place in artificial intelligence research. Text-to-image models achieved high-quality results over the last few years. However, video synthesis methods recently started to develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model. The first stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1 among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054.

We build Nova$^+$ to further boost Nova using two new pre-training tasks, i.e., optimization generation and optimization level prediction, which are designed to learn binary optimization and align equivalent binaries.

    "abstract": "The quantification of biomarkers on immunohistochemistry breast cancer images is essential for defining appropriate therapy for breast cancer patients, as well as for extracting relevant information on disease prognosis. This is an arduous and time-consuming task that may introduce a bias in the results due to intra- and inter-observer variability which could be alleviated by making use of automatic quantification tools. However, this is not a simple processing task given the heterogeneity of breast tumors that results in non-uniformly distributed tumor cells exhibiting different staining colors and intensity, size, shape, and texture, of the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane. In this research work, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a deep learning-based instance segmentation architecture for the automatic quantification of both nuclear and membrane biomarkers applied to IHC-stained slides. We have solved the cumbersome task of training set generation with the design and implementation of a web platform, which has served as a hub for communication and feedback between researchers and pathologists as well as a system for the validation of the automatic image processing models. Through this tool, we have collected annotations over samples of HE, ER and Ki-67 (nuclear biomarkers) and HER2 (membrane biomarker) IHC-stained images. Using the same deep learning network architecture, we have trained two models, so-called nuclei- and membrane-aware segmentation models, which, once successfully validated, have revealed to be a promising method to segment nuclei instances in IHC-stained images. The quantification method proposed in this work has been integrated into the developed web platform and is currently being used as a decision-support tool by pathologists",

We introduce the CommonSense Object Affordance Task (COAT), a novel framework designed to analyze reasoning capabilities in commonsense scenarios. This approach is centered on understanding how these agents can effectively identify and utilize alternative objects when executing household tasks, thereby offering insights into the complexities of practical decision-making in real-world environments.Drawing inspiration from human decision-making, we explore how large language models tackle this challenge through three meticulously crafted commonsense question-and-answer datasets, featuring refined rules and human annotations. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models on these datasets sheds light on three pivotal considerations: 1) aligning an object's inherent utility with the task at hand, 2) navigating contextual dependencies (societal norms, safety, appropriateness, and efficiency), and 3) accounting for the current physical state of the object. To maintain accessibility, we introduce five abstract variables reflecting an object's physical condition, modulated by human insights to simulate diverse household scenarios. Our contributions include insightful Object-Utility mappings addressing the first consideration and two extensive QA datasets (15k and 130k questions) probing the intricacies of contextual dependencies and object states. The datasets, along with our findings, are accessible at: \\url{https://github.com/com-phy-affordance/COAT}.

We aim to assess the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in the task of zero-shot long document evidence retrieval, owing to their unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks. However, currently the LLMs can consume limited context lengths as input, thus providing document chunks as inputs might overlook the global context while missing out on capturing the inter-segment dependencies. Moreover, directly feeding the large input sets can incur significant computational costs, particularly when processing the entire document (and potentially incurring monetary expenses with enterprise APIs like OpenAI's GPT variants). To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques that exploit the discourse structure commonly found in documents. By utilizing this structure, we create a condensed representation of the document, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of relationships between different parts. We retain $99.6\\%$ of the best zero-shot approach's performance, while processing only $26\\%$ of the total tokens used by the best approach in the information seeking evidence retrieval setup.

However, most current methods require reference to stylized images and cannot individually stylize specific objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"Soulstyler\" framework, which allows users to guide the stylization of specific objects in an image through simple textual descriptions. We introduce a large language model to parse the text and identify stylization goals and specific styles. Combined with a CLIP-based semantic visual embedding encoder, the model understands and matches text and image content. We also introduce a novel localized text-image block matching loss that ensures that style transfer is performed only on specified target objects, while non-target regions remain in their original style. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately perform style transfer on target objects according to textual descriptions without affecting the style of background regions.

Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularities. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the \"reasoner\", and can flexibly leverage visual embeddings, action labels, and free-form descriptions extracted from videos as its input. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, Next-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A wide range of imaging techniques and data formats available for medical images make accurate retrieval from image databases challenging. Efficient retrieval systems are crucial in advancing medical research, enabling large-scale studies and innovative diagnostic tools. Thus, addressing the challenges of medical image retrieval is essential for the continued enhancement of healthcare and research. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality, body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity indexing approaches. Since the employed networks take 2D images, we analyzed the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information during retrieval of 3D volumes. We showed that medical image retrieval is feasible using pretrained networks without any additional training or fine-tuning steps. Using pretrained embeddings, we achieved a recall of 1 for various tasks at modality, body region, and organ level",

    "title": "Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum Computers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be used with current systems. We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits, which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%)",

In comparison to single-pixel infrared HSI methods based on compressed sensing and physics-driven convolution neural networks, our physics-driven GAN-based single-pixel infrared HSI can achieve higher imaging performance but with fewer measurements.

However, this operation may result in significant performance degeneration on general tasks beyond the targeted domain. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method which enables the fine-tuned model to stay resilient in general perspectives. Our method is conducted in the form of model merging (namely LM-Cocktail), where the fine-tuned language model is merged with the pre-trained base model or the peer models from other domains through weighted average. Despite simplicity, LM-Cocktail is surprisingly effective: the resulted model is able to achieve a strong empirical performance in the whole scope of general tasks while preserving a superior capacity in its targeted domain. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLama and BGE model on popular benchmarks, including FLAN, MMLU, MTEB, whose results validate the efficacy of our proposed method.

The core part of our approach is a novel data scheduler, which employs \"spaced repetition\" and complexity formalisms to guide the training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several text graph tasks and graph neural network architectures. The proposed model gains more and uses less data; consistently prefers text over graph complexity indices throughout training, while the best curricula derived from text and graph complexity indices are equally effective; and it learns transferable curricula across GNN models and datasets. In addition, we find that both node-level (local) and graph-level (global) graph complexity indices, as well as shallow and traditional text complexity indices play a crucial role in effective curriculum learning",

The research is centred on employing GPT-3.5-turbo to automate the analysis of these arguments, with a focus on understanding intricate reasoning processes, generating clear and coherent explanations, and creating novel arguments. The methodology encompasses a series of tasks including detailed reasoning, interpretation, and the augmentation of a fortiori arguments. It involves meticulously identifying these arguments in diverse contexts, differentiating comparative elements, and categorizing them based on their logical structure. Extensive experiments reveals the challenges encountered by GPT-3.5-turbo in accurately detecting and classifying a fortiori arguments. Nevertheless, the model demonstrates a performance that rivals specialized models, particularly in extracting key components and interpreting underlying properties. The integration of external information into the model's processing significantly elevates the quality of the generated explanations. Additionally, the model exhibits a noteworthy capability in augmenting arguments, thus contributing to the enrichment of the data set.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Extending image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMM) to videos is challenging due to the inherent complexity of video data. The recent approaches extending image-based LMM to videos either lack the grounding capabilities (e.g., VideoChat, Video-ChatGPT, Video-LLaMA) or do not utilize the audio-signals for better video understanding (e.g., Video-ChatGPT). Addressing these gaps, we propose Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially and temporally localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5. Our framework builds on SoTA image-based LLaVA model and extends its advantages to the video domain, delivering promising gains on video-based conversation and grounding tasks.

One of the models gaining attention are probabilistic circuits (PCs), which are a general and unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries. Probabilistic circuits guarantee inference that is polynomial in the size of the circuit. In this paper, we improve the explainability of probabilistic circuits by computing a comprehensible, readable logical theory that covers the high-density regions generated by a PC. To achieve this, pruning approaches based on generative significance are used in a new method called PUTPUT (Probabilistic circuit Understanding Through Pruning Underlying logical Theories). The method is applied to a real world use case where music playlists are automatically generated and expressed as readable (database) queries. Evaluation shows that this approach can effectively produce a comprehensible logical theory that describes the high-density regions of a PC and outperforms state of the art methods when exploring the performance-comprehensibility trade-off",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized for solving complex sequential decision-making tasks by providing high-level instructions. However, LLM-based agents face limitations in real-time dynamic environments due to their lack of specialization in solving specific target problems. Moreover, the deployment of such LLM-based agents is both costly and time-consuming in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller scale specialized student agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent. By leveraging guided actions provided by the teachers, the prior knowledge of the LLM is distilled into the local student model. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less data. Furthermore, subsequent training with environment feedback empowers the student agents to surpass the capabilities of their teachers. We conducted experiments on three challenging MiniGrid environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

A critical discussion elaborates advantages and disadvantages. @ve could be a new tool for teaching Latin in a memorable and entertaining way through dialogue. However, the present implementation is still too prone to glitches for stand-alone use - i.e., without the accompaniment of a teacher.

Accurate 3D tooth segmentation in IOSs is critical for various dental applications, while previous methods are error-prone at complicated boundaries and exhibit unsatisfactory results across patients. In this paper, we propose TSegFormer which captures both local and global dependencies among different teeth and the gingiva in the IOS point clouds with a multi-task 3D transformer architecture. Moreover, we design a geometry-guided loss based on a novel point curvature to refine boundaries in an end-to-end manner, avoiding time-consuming post-processing to reach clinically applicable segmentation. In addition, we create a dataset with 16,000 IOSs, the largest ever IOS dataset to the best of our knowledge.

In this paper, we propose a novel reference-free, uncertainty-based method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs. Our approach imitates human focus in factuality checking from three aspects: 1) focus on the most informative and important keywords in the given text; 2) focus on the unreliable tokens in historical context which may lead to a cascade of hallucinations; and 3) focus on the token properties such as token type and token frequency.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce an approach to building a custom model from ready-made self-supervised models via their associating instead of training and fine-tuning. We demonstrate it with an example of a humanoid robot looking at the mirror and learning to detect the 3D pose of its own body from the image it perceives. To build our model, we first obtain features from the visual input and the postures of the robot's body via models prepared before the robot's operation. Then, we map their corresponding latent spaces by a sample-efficient robot's self-exploration at the mirror. In this way, the robot builds the solicited 3D pose detector, which quality is immediately perfect on the acquired samples instead of obtaining the quality gradually. The mapping, which employs associating the pairs of feature vectors, is then implemented in the same way as the key-value mechanism of the famous transformer models. Finally, deploying our model for imitation to a simulated robot allows us to study, tune up, and systematically evaluate its hyperparameters without the involvement of the human counterpart, advancing our previous research",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in the Service of Entrepreneurial Finance: Knowledge Structure and the Foundational Algorithmic Paradigm",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While the application of Artificial Intelligence in Finance has a long tradition, its potential in Entrepreneurship has been intensively explored only recently. In this context, Entrepreneurial Finance is a particularly fertile ground for future Artificial Intelligence proliferation. To support the latter, the study provides a bibliometric review of Artificial Intelligence applications in (1) entrepreneurial finance literature, and (2) corporate finance literature with implications for Entrepreneurship. Rigorous search and screening procedures of the scientific database Web of Science Core Collection resulted in the identification of 1890 relevant journal articles subjected to analysis. The bibliometric analysis gives a rich insight into the knowledge field's conceptual, intellectual, and social structure, indicating nascent and underdeveloped research directions. As far as we were able to identify, this is the first study to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic field concerning the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship, and Finance, and the first review that deals with Artificial Intelligence methods in Entrepreneurship. According to the results, Artificial Neural Network, Deep Neural Network and Support Vector Machine are highly represented in almost all identified topic niches. At the same time, applying Topic Modeling, Fuzzy Neural Network and Growing Hierarchical Self-organizing Map is quite rare. As an element of the research, and before final remarks, the article deals as well with a discussion of certain gaps in the relationship between Computer Science and Economics. These gaps do represent problems in the application of Artificial Intelligence in Economic Science. As a way to at least in part remedy this situation, the foundational paradigm and the bespoke demonstration of the Monte Carlo randomized algorithm are presented",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a serious disease that inflicts millions of people each year, and the number of cases is increasing. Early detection is the best way to reduce the impact of the disease. Researchers have developed many techniques to detect breast cancer, including the use of histopathology images in CAD systems. This research proposes a technique that combine already fully trained model using adaptive average ensemble, this is different from the literature which uses average ensemble before training and the average ensemble is trained simultaneously. Our approach is different because it used adaptive average ensemble after training which has increased the performance of evaluation metrics. It averages the outputs of every trained model, and every model will have weight according to its accuracy. The accuracy in the adaptive weighted ensemble model has achieved 98% where the accuracy has increased by 1 percent which is better than the best participating model in the ensemble which was 97%. Also, it decreased the numbers of false positive and false negative and enhanced the performance metrics",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large language models (LLMs) have become a hot research topic. Education plays an important role in human social development and progress. Traditional education faces challenges such as individual student differences, insufficient allocation of teaching resources, and assessment of teaching effectiveness. Therefore, the applications of LLMs in the field of digital/smart education have broad prospects. The research on educational large models (EduLLMs) is constantly evolving, providing new methods and approaches to achieve personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and educational assessment goals, thereby improving the quality of education and the learning experience. This article aims to investigate and summarize the application of LLMs in smart education. It first introduces the research background and motivation of LLMs and explains the essence of LLMs. It then discusses the relationship between digital education and EduLLMs and summarizes the current research status of educational large models. The main contributions are the systematic summary and vision of the research background, motivation, and application of large models for education (LLM4Edu). By reviewing existing research, this article provides guidance and insights for educators, researchers, and policy-makers to gain a deep understanding of the potential and challenges of LLM4Edu. It further provides guidance for further advancing the development and application of LLM4Edu, while still facing technical, ethical, and practical challenges requiring further research and exploration",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.The source code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor}",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely recognized as transformative technology due to their capabilities to understand and generate natural language text, including plans with some limited reasoning capabilities. LLM-based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of LLMs, which enable them to autonomously break down the given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate the task execution to fulfill the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building LLM-based autonomous agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using autonomous agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as architecture design guidelines and enables responsible-AI-by-design when designing LLM-based autonomous agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposed reference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-world agents",

    "title": "Toward Robust Imperceptible Perturbation against Unauthorized Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language serves as a vehicle for conveying thought, enabling communication among individuals. The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts, identify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions fundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in logical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation methodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute to the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks while acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic",

    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

    "abstract": "Passively collected behavioral health data from ubiquitous sensors holds significant promise to provide mental health professionals insights from patient's daily lives; however, developing analysis tools to use this data in clinical practice requires addressing challenges of generalization across devices and weak or ambiguous correlations between the measured signals and an individual's mental health. To address these challenges, we take a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to synthesize clinically useful insights from multi-sensor data. We develop chain of thought prompting methods that use LLMs to generate reasoning about how trends in data such as step count and sleep relate to conditions like depression and anxiety. We first demonstrate binary depression classification with LLMs achieving accuracies of 61.1% which exceed the state of the art. While it is not robust for clinical use, this leads us to our key finding: even more impactful and valued than classification is a new human-AI collaboration approach in which clinician experts interactively query these tools and combine their domain expertise and context about the patient with AI generated reasoning to support clinical decision-making. We find models like GPT-4 correctly reference numerical data 75% of the time, and clinician participants express strong interest in using this approach to interpret self-tracking data",

The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization",

Object-detection-based convolutional neural networks, regression analysis and multilayer perceptrons are combined to analyse visual data of the Viennese public during 2020. We find that mask-wearing-related government regulations and public-transport announcements encouraged correct mask-wearing-behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, changes in announcement and regulation contents led to heterogeneous effects on people's behaviour. Comparing the predictive power of regression analysis and neural networks, we demonstrate that the latter produces more accurate predictions of population reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our use of regression modelling also allows us to unearth possible causal pathways underlying societal behaviour. Since our findings highlight the importance of appropriate communication contents, our results will facilitate more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to be developed in future.

This paper describes the scANN technique -- \\textit{sampling (by coinflips) artificial neural networks} -- which enables neural networks to be sampled directly by treating the weights as Bernoulli coin flips.

    "title": "Favour: FAst Variance Operator for Uncertainty Rating",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have emerged as a crucial approach for interpreting ML predictions. By sampling from the posterior distribution, data scientists may estimate the uncertainty of an inference. Unfortunately many inference samples are often needed, the overhead of which greatly hinder BNN's wide adoption. To mitigate this, previous work proposed propagating the first and second moments of the posterior directly through the network. However, on its own this method is even slower than sampling, so the propagated variance needs to be approximated such as assuming independence between neural nodes. The resulting trade-off between quality and inference time did not match even plain Monte Carlo sampling. Our contribution is a more principled variance propagation framework based on \"spiked covariance matrices\", which smoothly interpolates between quality and inference time. This is made possible by a new fast algorithm for updating a diagonal-plus-low-rank matrix approximation under various operations. We tested our algorithm against sampling based MC Dropout and Variational Inference on a number of downstream uncertainty themed tasks, such as calibration and out-of-distribution testing. We find that Favour is as fast as performing 2-3 inference samples, while matching the performance of 10-100 samples. In summary, this work enables the use of BNN in the realm of performance critical tasks where they have previously been out of reach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces GeoMorph, a novel geometric deep-learning framework designed for image registration of cortical surfaces. The registration process consists of two main steps. First, independent feature extraction is performed on each input surface using graph convolutions, generating low-dimensional feature representations that capture important cortical surface characteristics. Subsequently, features are registered in a deep-discrete manner to optimize the overlap of common structures across surfaces by learning displacements of a set of control points. To ensure smooth and biologically plausible deformations, we implement regularization through a deep conditional random field implemented with a recurrent neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoMorph surpasses existing deep-learning methods by achieving improved alignment with smoother deformations. Furthermore, GeoMorph exhibits competitive performance compared to classical frameworks. Such versatility and robustness suggest strong potential for various neuroscience applications",

    "title": "Fast and Interpretable Mortality Risk Scores for Critical Care Patients",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is an important task in critical care medicine. Prior work in creating mortality risk models falls into two major categories: domain-expert-created scoring systems, and black box machine learning (ML) models. Both of these have disadvantages: black box models are unacceptable for use in hospitals, whereas manual creation of models (including hand-tuning of logistic regression parameters) relies on humans to perform high-dimensional constrained optimization, which leads to a loss in performance. In this work, we bridge the gap between accurate black box models and hand-tuned interpretable models. We build on modern interpretable ML techniques to design accurate and interpretable mortality risk scores. We leverage the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets, namely the MIMIC III and eICU datasets. By evaluating risk across medical centers, we are able to study generalization across domains. In order to customize our risk score models, we develop a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several important benefits: (1) it uses hard sparsity constraint, allowing users to directly control the number of features; (2) it incorporates group sparsity to allow more cohesive models; (3) it allows for monotonicity correction on models for including domain knowledge; (4) it produces many equally-good models at once, which allows domain experts to choose among them. GroupFasterRisk creates its risk scores within hours, even on the large datasets we study here. GroupFasterRisk's risk scores perform better than risk scores currently used in hospitals, and have similar prediction performance to black box ML models (despite being much sparser). Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of risk scores and handles constraints, it allows design flexibility, which is the key enabler of practical and trustworthy model creation",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of AI, combined with its unprecedented public adoption and the propensity of large neural networks to memorize training data, has given rise to significant data privacy concerns. To address these concerns, machine unlearning has emerged as an essential technique to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points on trained models. In this paper, we approach the machine unlearning problem through the lens of continual learning. Given a trained model and a subset of training data designated to be forgotten (i.e., the \"forget set\"), we introduce a three-step process, named CovarNav, to facilitate this forgetting. Firstly, we derive a proxy for the model's training data using a model inversion attack. Secondly, we mislabel the forget set by selecting the most probable class that deviates from the actual ground truth. Lastly, we deploy a gradient projection method to minimize the cross-entropy loss on the modified forget set (i.e., learn incorrect labels for this set) while preventing forgetting of the inverted samples. We rigorously evaluate CovarNav on the CIFAR-10 and Vggface2 datasets, comparing our results with recent benchmarks in the field and demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach",

Given the inherent compositional nature of language, one can expect the model to learn to compose these capabilities, potentially yielding a combinatorial explosion of what operations it can perform on an input. Motivated by the above, we aim to assess in this paper \"how capable can a transformer become?\". Specifically, we train autoregressive Transformer models on a data-generating process that involves compositions of a set of well-defined monolithic capabilities. Through a series of extensive and systematic experiments on this data-generating process, we show that: (1) autoregressive Transformers can learn compositional structures from the training data and generalize to exponentially or even combinatorially many functions; (2) composing functions by generating intermediate outputs is more effective at generalizing to unseen compositions, compared to generating no intermediate outputs; (3) the training data has a significant impact on the model's ability to compose unseen combinations of functions; and (4) the attention layers in the latter half of the model are critical to compositionality",

    "abstract": "In the realm of aerial image analysis, object detection plays a pivotal role, with significant implications for areas such as remote sensing, urban planning, and disaster management. This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff. The proposed model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of approximately 45.7%, which is a significant improvement, outperforming the RCNN model by 4.7% on the same dataset. This advancement underscores the effectiveness of the proposed modifications and sets a new benchmark in aerial image analysis, paving the way for more accurate and efficient object detection methodologies.

The proposed hybrid drone-based framework integrates long short-term memory with unique cost functions using an evolutionary neural network for drones and BSs, and efficiently manages energy and load redistribution.

However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead train marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional model improves over various marginal baselines.

One of the central challenges of instruction tuning is dataset selection, as the composition of the instruction tuning dataset can significantly impact downstream performance. In particular, researchers have hypothesized that dataset diversity and dataset quality are important indicators of downstream performance. However, it is not clear how to automatically select high quality and diverse data or how exactly quality and diversity affect instruction following ability. To resolve these issues, we propose a new algorithm, Quality-Diversity Instruction Tuning (QDIT). QDIT provides a principled algorithm to control dataset diversity and quality, allowing us to conduct an in depth study on the effect of diversity and quality on instruction tuning performance. From this study we draw two key insights (1) there is a natural tradeoff between dataset diversity and quality and (2) increasing dataset diversity significantly improves the worst case instruction following performance, therefore improving robustness. We validate the performance of QDIT on several large scale instruction tuning datasets, where we find it can improve worst case performance by 18% while maintaining or improving average performance compared to quality driven baselines",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present hierarchical learning, a novel variational architecture for efficient training of large-scale variational quantum circuits. We test and benchmark our technique for distribution loading with quantum circuit born machines (QCBMs). With QCBMs, probability distributions are loaded into the squared amplitudes of computational basis vectors represented by bitstrings. Our key insight is to take advantage of the fact that the most significant (qu)bits have a greater effect on the final distribution and can be learned first. One can think of it as a generalization of layerwise learning, where some parameters of the variational circuit are learned first to prevent the phenomena of barren plateaus. We briefly review adjoint methods for computing the gradient, in particular for loss functions that are not expectation values of observables. We first compare the role of connectivity in the variational ansatz for the task of loading a Gaussian distribution on nine qubits, finding that 2D connectivity greatly outperforms qubits arranged on a line. Based on our observations, we then implement this strategy on large-scale numerical experiments with GPUs, training a QCBM to reproduce a 3-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution on 27 qubits up to $\\sim4\\%$ total variation distance. Though barren plateau arguments do not strictly apply here due to the objective function not being tied to an observable, this is to our knowledge the first practical demonstration of variational learning on large numbers of qubits. We also demonstrate hierarchical learning as a resource-efficient way to load distributions for existing quantum hardware (IBM's 7 and 27 qubit devices) in tandem with Fire Opal optimizations",

Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden capabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task.

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in improving our algorithmic understanding of fundamental statistical problems such as mean estimation, driven by the goal of understanding the limits of what we can extract from valuable data. The state of the art results for mean estimation in $\\mathbb{R}$ are 1) the optimal sub-Gaussian mean estimator by [LV22], with the tight sub-Gaussian constant for all distributions with finite but unknown variance, and 2) the analysis of the median-of-means algorithm by [BCL13] and a lower bound by [DLLO16], characterizing the big-O optimal errors for distributions for which only a $1+\\alpha$ moment exists for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. Both results, however, are optimal only in the worst case. We initiate the fine-grained study of the mean estimation problem: Can algorithms leverage useful features of the input distribution to beat the sub-Gaussian rate, without explicit knowledge of such features? We resolve this question with an unexpectedly nuanced answer: \"Yes in limited regimes, but in general no\". For any distribution $p$ with a finite mean, we construct a distribution $q$ whose mean is well-separated from $p$'s, yet $p$ and $q$ are not distinguishable with high probability, and $q$ further preserves $p$'s moments up to constants. The main consequence is that no reasonable estimator can asymptotically achieve better than the sub-Gaussian error rate for any distribution, matching the worst-case result of [LV22]. More generally, we introduce a new definitional framework to analyze the fine-grained optimality of algorithms, which we call \"neighborhood optimality\", interpolating between the unattainably strong \"instance optimality\" and the trivially weak \"admissibility\" definitions. Applying the new framework, we show that median-of-means is neighborhood optimal, up to constant factors. It is open to find a neighborhood-optimal estimator without constant factor slackness",

We applied the COBRA score to address a key limitation of current clinical evaluation of upper-body impairment in stroke patients. The gold-standard Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) requires in-person administration by a trained assessor for 30-45 minutes, which restricts monitoring frequency and precludes physicians from adapting rehabilitation protocols to the progress of each patient. The COBRA score, computed automatically in under one minute, is shown to be strongly correlated with the FMA on an independent test cohort for two different data modalities: wearable sensors ($\\rho = 0.845$, 95% CI [0.743,0.908]) and video ($\\rho = 0.746$, 95% C.I [0.594, 0.847]).

In this work, we evaluate how reward model performance - measured via accuracy and calibration (i.e. alignment between accuracy and confidence) - is affected by distribution shift. We show novel calibration patterns and accuracy drops due to OOD prompts and responses, and that the reward model is more sensitive to shifts in responses than prompts.

    "abstract": "Ensuring high-quality video content for wireless users has become increasingly vital. Nevertheless, maintaining a consistent level of video quality faces challenges due to the fluctuating encoded bitrate, primarily caused by dynamic video content, especially in live streaming scenarios. Video compression is typically employed to eliminate unnecessary redundancies within and between video frames, thereby reducing the required bandwidth for video transmission. The encoded bitrate and the quality of the compressed video depend on encoder parameters, specifically, the quantization parameter (QP). Poor choices of encoder parameters can result in reduced bandwidth efficiency and high likelihood of non-conformance. Non-conformance refers to the violation of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) constraint for an encoded video segment. To address these issues, a real-time deep learning-based H.264 controller is proposed. This controller dynamically estimates the optimal encoder parameters based on the content of a video chunk with minimal delay. The objective is to maintain video quality in terms of PSNR above a specified threshold while minimizing the average bitrate of the compressed video. Experimental results, conducted on both QCIF dataset and a diverse range of random videos from public datasets, validate the effectiveness of this approach. Notably, it achieves improvements of up to 2.5 times in average bandwidth usage compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive bitrate video streaming, with a negligible non-conformance probability below $10^{-2}$",

Orchard reconstructs more plausible phylogenies than state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods on 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). These results demonstrate that Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies with up to 300 mutations.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method of classifying malware into families using high-resolution greyscale images and multiple instance learning to overcome adversarial binary enlargement. Current methods of visualisation-based malware classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing to handle the large, variable-sized images. Through empirical analysis and experimentation, it is shown that these approaches cause crucial information loss that can be exploited. The proposed solution divides the images into patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\\%$ on adversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\\%$.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A sketch is one of the most intuitive and versatile tools humans use to convey their ideas visually. An animated sketch opens another dimension to the expression of ideas and is widely used by designers for a variety of purposes. Animating sketches is a laborious process, requiring extensive experience and professional design skills. In this work, we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence, \"breathing life into it\"), merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation, which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training, but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance, we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly, we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations",

    "title": "SelfOcc: Self-Supervised Vision-Based 3D Occupancy Prediction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present the neural-integrated meshfree (NIM) method, a differentiable programming-based hybrid meshfree approach within the field of computational mechanics. NIM seamlessly integrates traditional physics-based meshfree discretization techniques with deep learning architectures. It employs a hybrid approximation scheme, NeuroPU, to effectively represent the solution by combining continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis functions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This neural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation through functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN model and the need for spatial gradient computations based on automatic differentiation, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency. Under the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong form-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the S-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the loss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov-Galerkin approach that allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary overlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying physics and the preservation of meshfree property. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover, comparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods demonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities",

Recently, deep learning algorithms have demonstrated superior performance results in time-series data classification in many smart and intelligent IoT applications. However, it is hard to explore the hidden dynamic patterns and trends in time-series. Recent studies show that transforming IoT data into images improves the performance of the learning model.

We examine the studies according to their encoding techniques, data types, and application areas. Lastly, we emphasize the challenges and future dimensions of image transformation",

In these models, the link structure of the graph is typically exploited and nodes' embeddings are iteratively updated based on adjacent nodes. Nodes' contents are used solely in the form of feature vectors, served as nodes' first-layer embeddings. However, the filters or convolutions, applied during iterations/layers to these initial embeddings lead to their impact diminish and contribute insignificantly to the final embeddings. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose augmenting nodes' embeddings by embeddings generating from their content, at higher GNN layers. More precisely, we propose models wherein a structural embedding using a GNN and a content embedding are computed for each node. These two are combined using a combination layer to form the embedding of a node at a given layer. We suggest methods such as using an auto-encoder or building a content graph, to generate content embeddings. In the end, by conducting experiments over several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and performance of our models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Autonomous driving (AD) systems are often built and tested in a modular fashion, where the performance of different modules is measured using task-specific metrics. These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole. For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their implications for AD system deployment and testing",

Such autocurricula have received much interest from the RL community. However, UED experiments, based on CPU rollouts and GPU model updates, have often required several weeks of training. This compute requirement is a major obstacle to rapid innovation for the field. This work introduces the minimax library for UED training on accelerated hardware. Using JAX to implement fully-tensorized environments and autocurriculum algorithms, minimax allows the entire training loop to be compiled for hardware acceleration. To provide a petri dish for rapid experimentation, minimax includes a tensorized grid-world based on MiniGrid, in addition to reusable abstractions for conducting autocurricula in procedurally-generated environments. With these components, minimax provides strong UED baselines, including new parallelized variants, which achieve over 120$\\times$ speedups in wall time compared to previous implementations when training with equal batch sizes.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning is an important emerging distributed training paradigm that keeps data private on clients. It is now well understood that by controlling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce a backdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes. In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness of the trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performance distribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where, for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could have disastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar to that of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregated model to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set of attributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controlling only a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL has previously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has been neglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be a critical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained model could benefit a user who participated in its training",

Conversely, if the model is overconfident on the calibration set, the use of conformal prediction may improve out-of-distribution coverage. We evaluate prediction sets as a result of combining split conformal methods and neural networks trained with (i) stochastic gradient descent, (ii) deep ensembles, and (iii) mean-field variational inference.

    "abstract": "Modern applications are increasingly driven by Machine Learning (ML) models whose non-deterministic behavior is affecting the entire application life cycle from design to operation. The pervasive adoption of ML is urgently calling for approaches that guarantee a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications over time and across model changes. To this aim, non-functional properties of ML models, such as privacy, confidentiality, fairness, and explainability, must be monitored, verified, and maintained. This need is even more pressing when modern applications operate in the edge-cloud continuum, increasing their complexity and dynamicity. Existing approaches mostly focus on i) implementing classifier selection solutions according to the functional behavior of ML models, ii) finding new algorithmic solutions to this need, such as continuous re-training. In this paper, we propose a multi-model approach built on dynamic classifier selection, where multiple ML models showing similar non-functional properties are made available to the application and one model is selected over time according to (dynamic and unpredictable) contextual changes. Our solution goes beyond the state of the art by providing an architectural and methodological approach that continuously guarantees a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications, is applicable to different ML models, and is driven by non-functional properties assessed on the models themselves. It consists of a two-step process working during application operation, where model assessment verifies non-functional properties of ML models trained and selected at development time, and model substitution guarantees a continuous and stable support of non-functional properties. We experimentally evaluate our solution in a real-world scenario focusing on non-functional property fairness",

To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning jointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and low unfairness.

In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting method to address such \\emph{representation bias}. To balance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our approach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical risk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the minority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance. Our theoretical analysis shows the effectiveness of our adversarial reweighting approach.

    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

Our approach involves contrastive matching of two different sensors (left and right wrist or leg-worn IMUs) to make representations of co-occurring sensor data more similar and those of non-co-occurring sensor data more different. We test our approach on the Opportunity and MM-Fit datasets. In MM-Fit we show significant improvement over the baseline supervised and self-supervised method SimCLR, while for Opportunity there is significant improvement over the supervised baseline and slight improvement when compared to SimCLR. Moreover, our method improves supervised baselines even when using only a small amount of the data for training. Future work should explore under which conditions our method is beneficial for human activity recognition systems and other related applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is a challenging, albeit essential task in drug repurposing. Learning on graph models have drawn special attention as they can significantly reduce drug repurposing costs and time commitment. However, many current approaches require high-demanding additional information besides DTIs that complicates their evaluation process and usability. Additionally, structural differences in the learning architecture of current models hinder their fair benchmarking. In this work, we first perform an in-depth evaluation of current DTI datasets and prediction models through a robust benchmarking process, and show that DTI prediction methods based on transductive models lack generalization and lead to inflated performance when evaluated as previously done in the literature, hence not being suited for drug repurposing approaches. We then propose a novel biologically-driven strategy for negative edge subsampling and show through in vitro validation that newly discovered interactions are indeed true. We envision this work as the underpinning for future fair benchmarking and robust model design. All generated resources and tools are publicly available as a python package",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned using human comparison data with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods to make them better aligned with users' preferences. In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates, vital components of biological systems, are well-known for their structural diversity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a crucial role in understanding their intricate molecular arrangements and is essential in assessing and verifying the molecular structure of organic molecules. An important part of this process is to predict the NMR chemical shift from the molecular structure. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages E(3) equivariant graph neural networks to predict carbohydrate NMR spectra. Notably, our model achieves a substantial reduction in mean absolute error, up to threefold, compared to traditional models that rely solely on two-dimensional molecular structure. Even with limited data, the model excels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities. The implications are far-reaching and go beyond an advanced understanding of carbohydrate structures and spectral interpretation. For example, it could accelerate research in pharmaceutical applications, biochemistry, and structural biology, offering a faster and more reliable analysis of molecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is a key step towards a new data-driven era in spectroscopy, potentially influencing spectroscopic techniques beyond NMR",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, compositional optimization (CO) has gained popularity because of its applications in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and many other machine learning problems. Large-scale and distributed availability of data demands the development of efficient federated learning (FL) algorithms for solving CO problems. Developing FL algorithms for CO is particularly challenging because of the compositional nature of the objective. Moreover, current state-of-the-art methods to solve such problems rely on large batch gradients (depending on the solution accuracy) not feasible for most practical settings. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose efficient FedAvg-type algorithms for solving non-convex CO in the FL setting. We first establish that vanilla FedAvg is not suitable to solve distributed CO problems because of the data heterogeneity in the compositional objective at each client which leads to the amplification of bias in the local compositional gradient estimates. To this end, we propose a novel FL framework FedDRO that utilizes the DRO problem structure to design a communication strategy that allows FedAvg to control the bias in the estimation of the compositional gradient. A key novelty of our work is to develop solution accuracy-independent algorithms that do not require large batch gradients (and function evaluations) for solving federated CO problems. We establish $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ communication complexity in the FL setting while achieving linear speedup with the number of clients. We corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical studies on large-scale DRO problems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting top-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph representations. However, this paper highlights two key issues with these methods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs additional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a thorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and subsequent prediction tasks. 2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly discard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the latent information contained within these elements. To address the first issue, we introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects nodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final representation vectors crucial for classification. The second issue is addressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies a uniform loss on the discarded nodes. This addition is designed to augment the training process and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our proposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets. Our experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14 baseline methods for most datasets. Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances GrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs",

Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to learn from its own mistakes. To address this, we equip Koopman methods - developed for predicting non-stationary time-series - with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data.

For the MMDP, we assume the state dynamics to be controlled by the joint actions of agents, but the per-stage costs to only depend on the individual agent's actions. We combine the Q-learning algorithm for a weighted combination of the costs of each agent, obtained by a gossip algorithm with the Metropolis-Hastings or Multiplicative Weights formalisms to modulate the averaging matrix of the gossip. We use multiple timescales in our algorithm and prove that under mild conditions, it approximately achieves the desired bounds for each of the agents. We also demonstrate the empirical performance of this algorithm in the more general setting of MMDPs having jointly controlled per-stage costs",

    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

The task of identifying reliable biomarkers to classify Schizophrenia accurately continues to be a challenge in the field of psychiatry. We investigate the temporal patterns within the motor activity data as a potential key to enhancing the categorization of individuals with Schizophrenia, using the dataset having motor activity recordings of 22 Schizophrenia patients and 32 control subjects. The dataset contains per-minute motor activity measurements collected for an average of 12.7 days in a row for each participant. We dissect each day into segments (Twelve, Eight, six, four, three, and two parts) and evaluate their impact on classification. We employ sixteen statistical features within these temporal segments and train them on Seven machine learning models to get deeper insights. LightGBM model outperforms the other six models. Our results indicate that the temporal segmentation significantly improves the classification, with AUC-ROC = 0.93, F1 score = 0.84( LightGBM- without any segmentation) and AUC-ROC = 0.98, F1 score = 0.93( LightGBM- with segmentation). Distinguishing between diurnal and nocturnal segments amplifies the differences between Schizophrenia patients and controls. However, further subdivisions into smaller time segments do not affect the AUC- ROC significantly. Morning, afternoon, evening, and night partitioning gives similar classification performance to day-night partitioning.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

    "abstract": "Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a new target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to annotate.This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to target a new and challenging setting of knowledge transfer that extends ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains, termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly, we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting, mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains and thus their uncertainty-aware sample selection can easily become miscalibrated under the multi-domain shifts. Considering this, we propose a Dynamic integrated uncertainty valuation framework(Detective) that comprehensively consider the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domain to detect the informative target samples. Specifically, the leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation(DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then comprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning, thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Furthermore, we introduce a contextual diversity-aware calculator to enhance the diversity of the selected samples.

In this paper, we present a case study on discovering a new symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from data using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection, and symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal features from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while selecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic regression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that retains the neural network's predictive capabilities, while allowing for interpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model reproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and achieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory. This showcases how machine learning can facilitate inductive scientific discovery, and paves the way for more accurate rogue wave forecasting",

    "abstract": "The AI development community is increasingly making use of hosting intermediaries such as Hugging Face provide easy access to user-uploaded models and training data. These model marketplaces lower technical deployment barriers for hundreds of thousands of users, yet can be used in numerous potentially harmful and illegal ways. In this article, we explain ways in which AI systems, which can both `contain' content and be open-ended tools, present one of the trickiest platform governance challenges seen to date. We provide case studies of several incidents across three illustrative platforms -- Hugging Face, GitHub and Civitai -- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models. Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited) practices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands: licensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open policy development. While the policy challenge at hand is a considerable one, we conclude with some ideas as to how platforms could better mobilize resources to act as a careful, fair, and proportionate regulatory access point",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Categorical random variables can faithfully represent the discrete and uncertain aspects of data as part of a discrete latent variable model. Learning in such models necessitates taking gradients with respect to the parameters of the categorical probability distributions, which is often intractable due to their combinatorial nature. A popular technique to estimate these otherwise intractable gradients is the Log-Derivative trick. This trick forms the basis of the well-known REINFORCE gradient estimator and its many extensions. While the Log-Derivative trick allows us to differentiate through samples drawn from categorical distributions, it does not take into account the discrete nature of the distribution itself. Our first contribution addresses this shortcoming by introducing the CatLog-Derivative trick - a variation of the Log-Derivative trick tailored towards categorical distributions. Secondly, we use the CatLog-Derivative trick to introduce IndeCateR, a novel and unbiased gradient estimator for the important case of products of independent categorical distributions with provably lower variance than REINFORCE. Thirdly, we empirically show that IndeCateR can be efficiently implemented and that its gradient estimates have significantly lower bias and variance for the same number of samples compared to the state of the art",

We parameterize this mixture distribution as a spline normalizing flow, which we train using variational inference. The proposed form of the variational posterior enables a sparse variational elliptical process applicable to large-scale problems. We highlight advantages compared to Gaussian processes through regression and classification experiments.

    "abstract": "In multi-lingual societies, where multiple languages are spoken in a small geographic vicinity, informal conversations often involve mix of languages. Existing speech technologies may be inefficient in extracting information from such conversations, where the speech data is rich in diversity with multiple languages and speakers. The DISPLACE (DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments) challenge constitutes an open-call for evaluating and bench-marking the speaker and language diarization technologies on this challenging condition. The challenge entailed two tracks: Track-1 focused on speaker diarization (SD) in multilingual situations while, Track-2 addressed the language diarization (LD) in a multi-speaker scenario. Both the tracks were evaluated using the same underlying audio data. To facilitate this evaluation, a real-world dataset featuring multilingual, multi-speaker conversational far-field speech was recorded and distributed. Furthermore, a baseline system was made available for both SD and LD task which mimicked the state-of-art in these tasks. The challenge garnered a total of $42$ world-wide registrations and received a total of $19$ combined submissions for Track-1 and Track-2. This paper describes the challenge, details of the datasets, tasks, and the baseline system. Additionally, the paper provides a concise overview of the submitted systems in both tracks, with an emphasis given to the top performing systems. The paper also presents insights and future perspectives for SD and LD tasks, focusing on the key challenges that the systems need to overcome before wide-spread commercial deployment on such conversations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time-frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals.

The training requires many pairs of a polynomial system and the associated Gr\\\"obner basis, thus motivating us to address two novel algebraic problems: random generation of Gr\\\"obner bases and the transformation of them into non-Gr\\\"obner polynomial systems, termed as \\textit{backward Gr\\\"obner problem}. We resolve these problems with zero-dimensional radical ideals, the ideals appearing in various applications.

This paper reclaims SNPE-B proposed by Lueckmann et al.

To address these issues, we firstly introduce a concentrated loss function based on an adaptive calibration kernel that reweights the simulated data appropriately to improve the data efficiency. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of the variance of associated Monte Carlo estimators. Based on this analysis, we then propose several variance reduction techniques to further accelerate the process of learning.

The framework of regularisation by projection is then used to find a reconstruction. The second one uses a simplified model of the physics of the measurement process and only relies on the training data to learn a model correction. We present the theory of these two approaches and compare them numerically.

Empirical results demonstrate its exceptional compression capability, maintaining high accuracy on the MNIST dataset with only 0.15\\% of the original network parameters. Moreover, our framework enhances neural network interpretability, not only by allowing easy extraction of feature importance directly from the pruned network but also by enabling visualization of feature symmetry and the pathways of information propagation from features to outcomes. Although the pruning strategy is learned through deep learning, it is surprisingly intuitive and understandable, focusing on selecting key representative features and exploiting data patterns to achieve extreme sparse pruning.

    "abstract": "Neural operators extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by allowing them to handle mappings between function spaces for the purpose of solving partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which is inspired by Green's function method and approximate operator kernel directly in the frequency domain. In this work, we focus on predicting multiscale dynamic spaces, which is equivalent to solving multiscale PDEs. Multiscale PDEs are characterized by rapid coefficient changes and solution space oscillations, which are crucial for modeling atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To solve this problem, models should have the ability to capture rapid changes and process them at various scales. However, the FNO only approximates kernels in the low-frequency domain, which is insufficient when solving multiscale PDEs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical neural operator that integrates improved Fourier layers with attention mechanisms, aiming to capture all details and handle them at various scales. These mechanisms complement each other in the frequency domain and encourage the model to solve multiscale problems. We perform experiments on dynamic spaces governed by forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations and some other physical scenarios, and reach superior performance in existing PDE benchmarks, especially equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In an era of increasing pressure to achieve sustainable agriculture, the optimization of livestock feed for enhancing yield and minimizing environmental impact is a paramount objective. This study presents a pioneering approach towards this goal, using rumen microbiome data to predict the efficacy of feed additives in dairy cattle. We collected an extensive dataset that includes methane emissions from 2,190 Holstein cows distributed across 34 distinct sites. The cows were divided into control and experimental groups in a double-blind, unbiased manner, accounting for variables such as age, days in lactation, and average milk yield. The experimental groups were administered one of four leading commercial feed additives: Agolin, Kexxtone, Allimax, and Relyon. Methane emissions were measured individually both before the administration of additives and over a subsequent 12-week period. To develop our predictive model for additive efficacy, rumen microbiome samples were collected from 510 cows from the same herds prior to the study's onset. These samples underwent deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing, yielding an average of 15.7 million reads per sample. Utilizing innovative artificial intelligence techniques we successfully estimated the efficacy of these feed additives across different farms. The model's robustness was further confirmed through validation with independent cohorts, affirming its generalizability and reliability. Our results underscore the transformative capability of using targeted feed additive strategies to both optimize dairy yield and milk composition, and to significantly reduce methane emissions. Specifically, our predictive model demonstrates a scenario where its application could guide the assignment of additives to farms where they are most effective. In doing so, we could achieve an average potential reduction of over 27\\% in overall emissions",

The recent surge of interest in MORL has led to diverse studies and solving methods, often drawing from existing knowledge in multi-objective optimization based on decomposition (MOO/D). Yet, a clear categorization based on both RL and MOO/D is lacking in the existing literature. Consequently, MORL researchers face difficulties when trying to classify contributions within a broader context due to the absence of a standardized taxonomy. To tackle such an issue, this paper introduces Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition (MORL/D), a novel methodology bridging RL and MOO literature. A comprehensive taxonomy for MORL/D is presented, providing a structured foundation for categorizing existing and potential MORL works. The introduced taxonomy is then used to scrutinize MORL research, enhancing clarity and conciseness through well-defined categorization. Moreover, a flexible framework derived from the taxonomy is introduced. This framework accommodates diverse instantiations using tools from both RL and MOO/D. Implementation across various configurations demonstrates its versatility, assessed against benchmark problems. Results indicate MORL/D instantiations achieve comparable performance with significantly greater versatility than current state-of-the-art approaches. By presenting the taxonomy and framework, this paper offers a comprehensive perspective and a unified vocabulary for MORL. This not only facilitates the identification of algorithmic contributions but also lays the groundwork for novel research avenues in MORL, contributing to the continued advancement of this field",

However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel motion estimation method, MaskFlow, that is capable of estimating accurate motion fields, even in very challenging cases with small objects, large displacements and drastic appearance changes. In addition to lower-level features, that are used in other Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based motion estimation methods, MaskFlow draws from object-level features and segmentations. These features and segmentations are used to approximate the objects' translation motion field. We propose a novel and effective way of incorporating the incomplete translation motion field into a subsequent motion estimation network for refinement and completion. We also produced a new challenging synthetic dataset with motion field ground truth, and also provide extra ground truth for the object-instance matchings and corresponding segmentation masks. We demonstrate that MaskFlow outperforms state of the art methods when evaluated on our new challenging dataset, whilst still producing comparable results on the popular FlyingThings3D benchmark dataset",

    "title": "Classifier Calibration with ROC-Regularized Isotonic Regression",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Calibration of machine learning classifiers is necessary to obtain reliable and interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between model confidence and actual probabilities. One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims at calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy on a calibration set via monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning procedure, which allows achieving a calibration error of zero, but leaves open the issue of the effect on performance. In this paper, we first prove that IR preserves the convex hull of the ROC curve -- an essential performance metric for binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while controlling for overfitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel generalization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with K classes. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on the probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal to zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that preserves the K-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically that this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between reducing cross entropy loss and avoiding overfitting of the calibration set",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the recent years, the raise in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on one side encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for ``fair'' algorithms. We believe that while a lot of excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having ``fair'' algorithms is per s\\'e a nearly meaningless requirement, that needs to be complemented with a lot of additional societal choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus, and pinpoint a list of fundamental ambiguities and attention points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

Typically routes are assigned a grade to inform climbers of its difficulty and allow them to more easily track their progression. However, the variation in individual climbers technical and physical attributes and many nuances of an individual route make grading a difficult and often biased task. In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI",

Initially, the learning rate is sampled with three basis distributions as hyperparameters to convert the infinite mixture into a finite one. All checkpoints are collected to establish a deep learning sub-model pool, and weight adjustment and diversity strategies are developed during the combination process. The main advantage of this method is its ability to generate the required base learners through a single training process, utilizing the decaying strategy to tackle the challenge posed by the stochastic nature of gradient descent in determining the optimal learning rate. To ensure the method's generalizability and competitiveness, this paper conducts an empirical analysis using the weekly dataset from the M4 competition and explores sensitivity to the number of models to be combined.

We design a commonsense validation pipeline that uses a large language model to critique the results from the scene graph prediction system and then use that feedback to enhance the model performance. The system requires no external large language model assistance at test time, making it more convenient for practical applications. Experiments on the Visual Genome and the OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that harnessing hierarchical relationships enhances the model performance by a large margin. The proposed Bayesian head can also be incorporated as a portable module in existing scene graph generation algorithms to improve their results.

    "abstract": "Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a powerful technique for model compression, reducing the precision of neural networks without additional training overhead. Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads. Finally, we evaluate our results against an FPGA-based hardware cost model, showing that integer quantization often remains the Pareto-optimal option, given its relatively smaller hardware resource footprint",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) on heterogeneous data (non-IID data) has recently received great attention. Most existing methods focus on studying the convergence guarantees for the global objective. While these methods can guarantee the decrease of the global objective in each communication round, they fail to ensure risk decrease for each client. In this paper, to address the problem,we propose FedCOME, which introduces a consensus mechanism to enforce decreased risk for each client after each training round. In particular, we allow a slight adjustment to a client's gradient on the server side, which generates an acute angle between the corrected gradient and the original ones of other clients. We theoretically show that the consensus mechanism can guarantee the convergence of the global objective. To generalize the consensus mechanism to the partial participation FL scenario, we devise a novel client sampling strategy to select the most representative clients for the global data distribution. Training on these selected clients with the consensus mechanism could empirically lead to risk decrease for clients that are not selected. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to show the superiority of FedCOME against other state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness.

In this work, we propose a loss function termed Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, which is empirically shown to mitigate overfitting. With RLP loss, the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of the neural network's feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs is minimized. The intuition behind this loss derives from the notion that if two functions share the same hyperplanes connecting all subsets of feature-label pairs, then these functions must necessarily be equivalent. Our empirical studies, conducted across benchmark datasets and representative synthetic examples, demonstrate the improvements of the proposed RLP loss over mean squared error (MSE). Specifically, neural networks trained with the RLP loss achieve better performance while requiring fewer data samples and are more robust to additive noise.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey focusing on the advancement of model architecture in Transformer-based LLMs to optimize long-context capabilities across all stages from pre-training to inference. We firstly delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. Then, we mainly offer a holistic taxonomy to navigate the landscape of Transformer upgrades on architecture to solve these problems. Afterward, we provide the investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as some amazing optimization toolkits like libraries, systems, and compilers to augment LLMs' efficiency and efficacy across different stages.

To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

    "abstract": "We study accelerated optimization methods in the Gaussian phase retrieval problem. In this setting, we prove that gradient methods with Polyak or Nesterov momentum have similar implicit regularization to gradient descent. This implicit regularization ensures that the algorithms remain in a nice region, where the cost function is strongly convex and smooth despite being nonconvex in general. This ensures that these accelerated methods achieve faster rates of convergence than gradient descent. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the accelerated methods converge faster than gradient descent in practice",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are widely considered state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Although several GCN-based methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train if too many layers are created. However, since the linear GCN model can be interpreted as a differential equation, it is possible to transfer it to an ODE problem. This inspired us to address the computational limitations of GCN-based models by designing a simple and efficient NODE-based model that can skip some GCN layers to reach the final state, thus avoiding the need to create many layers. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation-based method for Collaborative Filtering (GODE-CF). This method estimates the final embedding by utilizing the information captured by one or two GCN layers. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines, including GCN-based models and other state-of-the-art CF methods. Notably, our proposed GODE-CF model has several advantages over traditional GCN-based models. It is simple, efficient, and has a fast training time, making it a practical choice for real-world situations",

    "title": "Modeling Political Orientation of Social Media Posts: An Extended Analysis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab and Twitter",

    "abstract": "A customer service platform system with a core text semantic similarity (STS) task faces two urgent challenges: Firstly, one platform system needs to adapt to different domains of customers, i.e., different domains adaptation (DDA). Secondly, it is difficult for the model of the platform system to distinguish sentence pairs that are literally close but semantically different, i.e., hard negative samples. In this paper, we propose an incorporation external keywords matrices model (IEKM) to address these challenges. The model uses external tools or dictionaries to construct external matrices and fuses them to the self-attention layers of the Transformer structure through gating units, thus enabling flexible corrections to the model results. We evaluate the method on multiple datasets and the results show that our method has improved performance on all datasets. To demonstrate that our method can effectively solve all the above challenges, we conduct a flexible correction experiment, which results in an increase in the F1 value from 56.61 to 73.53.

    "abstract": "We investigate the utility of graph neural networks (GNNs) as proxies of power grid operational decision-making algorithms (optimal power flow (OPF) and security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC)) to enable rigorous quantification of the operational risk. To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (foretasted) probability distributions of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s). The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification",

An evolutionary search process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific locations.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing \"Brain Coral\" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel pretraining procedure that leverages supervised contrastive learning to distinguish features within each pretraining dataset. This pretraining phase enables a probabilistic similarity metric, which assesses the likelihood of a univariate sample being closely related to one of the pretraining datasets. Subsequently, using this similarity metric as a guide, we propose a fine-tuning procedure designed to enhance the accurate prediction of the target data by aligning it more closely with the learned dynamics of the pretraining datasets.

Many studies have utilized machine learning or deep learning techniques to implement probabilistic forecasting reconciliation and have made notable progress.

In this paper, we propose a new approach for probabilistic forecast reconciliation. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed approach fuses the prediction step and reconciliation step into a deep learning framework, making the reconciliation step more flexible and soft by introducing the Kullback-Leibler divergence regularization term into the loss function. The approach is evaluated using three hierarchical time series datasets, which shows the advantages of our approach over other probabilistic forecast reconciliation methods",

    "abstract": "This paper studies causal representation learning, the task of recovering high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level data that we observe, assuming access to observations generated from multiple environments. While existing works are able to prove full identifiability of the underlying data generating process, they typically assume access to single-node, hard interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice. The main contribution of this paper is characterize a notion of identifiability which is provably the best one can achieve when hard interventions are not available. First, for linear causal models, we provide identifiability guarantee for data observed from general environments without assuming any similarities between them. While the causal graph is shown to be fully recovered, the latent variables are only identified up to an effect-domination ambiguity (EDA). We then propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which is guaranteed to recover the ground-truth model up to EDA, and we demonstrate its effectiveness via numerical experiments. Moving on to general non-parametric causal models, we prove the same idenfifiability guarantee assuming access to groups of soft interventions. Finally, we provide counterparts of our identifiability results, indicating that EDA is basically inevitable in our setting",

    "abstract": "Improving system-level resiliency of networked microgrids is an important aspect with increased population of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This paper (1) presents resilient control design in presence of adversarial cyber-events, and proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning (Fed-RL) approach to tackle (a) model complexities, unknown dynamical behaviors of IBR devices, (b) privacy issues regarding data sharing in multi-party-owned networked grids, and (2) transfers learned controls from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop test-bed, thereby bridging the gap between simulation and real world. With these multi-prong objectives, first, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) training setup generating episodic trajectories with adversaries (attack signal) injected at the primary controllers of the grid forming (GFM) inverters where RL agents (or controllers) are being trained to mitigate the injected attacks. For networked microgrids, the horizontal Fed-RL method involving distinct independent environments is not appropriate, leading us to develop vertical variant Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FedSAC) algorithm to grasp the interconnected dynamics of networked microgrid. Next, utilizing OpenAI Gym interface, we built a custom simulation set-up in GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform, named Resilient RL Co-simulation (ResRLCoSIM), to train the RL agents with IEEE 123-bus benchmark test systems comprising 3 interconnected microgrids. Finally, the learned policies in simulation world are transferred to the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up developed using high-fidelity Hypersim platform.

We then analyze the accuracy of function value, gradient, and Hessian approximations for such objective functions obtained through interpolation/regression models and neural networks. When compared to interpolation/regression models, neural networks can deliver competitive zero- and first-order approximations (at a high training cost) but underperform on second-order approximation. However, it is shown that combining a neural net activation function with the natural basis for quadratic interpolation/regression can waive the necessity of including cross terms in the natural basis, leading to models with fewer parameters to determine.

    "abstract": "Although reinforcement learning methods offer a powerful framework for automatic skill acquisition, for practical learning-based control problems in domains such as robotics, imitation learning often provides a more convenient and accessible alternative. In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict na\\\"ive behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals themselves as rewards. This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imitation learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert. We also provide a unified framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non-asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method. We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal.

GPT-4V scores were compared with human experts' scores to calculate scoring accuracy. Results show that GPT-4V's average scoring accuracy was mean =.51, SD = .037. Specifically, average scoring accuracy was .64 for the 'Beginning' class, .62 for the 'Developing' class, and .26 for the 'Proficient' class, indicating that more proficient models are more challenging to score. Further qualitative study reveals how GPT-4V retrieves information from image input, including problem context, example evaluations provided by human coders, and students' drawing models. We also uncovered how GPT-4V catches the characteristics of student-drawn models and narrates them in natural language. At last, we demonstrated how GPT-4V assigns scores to student-drawn models according to the given scoring rubric and instructional notes. Our findings suggest that the NERIF is an effective approach for employing GPT-4V to score drawn models. Even though there is space for GPT-4V to improve scoring accuracy, some mis-assigned scores seemed interpretable to experts. The results of this study show that utilizing GPT-4V for automatic scoring of student-drawn models is promising",

In contrast, Arabic DL-based multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is still in its infantile stage due, mainly, to the lack of standard datasets. % The contribution In this paper, our investigation is twofold. First, we design a pipeline that helps building our Arabic Multimodal dataset leveraging both state-of-the-art transformers and feature extraction tools within word alignment techniques. Thereafter, we validate our dataset using state-of-the-art transformer-based model dealing with multimodality.

GAIA proposes real-world questions that require a set of fundamental abilities such as reasoning, multi-modality handling, web browsing, and generally tool-use proficiency. GAIA questions are conceptually simple for humans yet challenging for most advanced AIs: we show that human respondents obtain 92\\% vs. 15\\% for GPT-4 equipped with plugins. This notable performance disparity contrasts with the recent trend of LLMs outperforming humans on tasks requiring professional skills in e.g. law or chemistry. GAIA's philosophy departs from the current trend in AI benchmarks suggesting to target tasks that are ever more difficult for humans. We posit that the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on a system's capability to exhibit similar robustness as the average human does on such questions. Using GAIA's methodology, we devise 466 questions and their answer.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Same-Day Delivery (SDD) services aim to maximize the fulfillment of online orders while minimizing delivery delays but are beset by operational uncertainties such as those in order volumes and courier planning. Our work aims to enhance the operational efficiency of SDD by focusing on the ultra-fast Order Dispatching Problem (ODP), which involves matching and dispatching orders to couriers within a centralized warehouse setting, and completing the delivery within a strict timeline (e.g., within minutes). We introduce important extensions to ultra-fast ODP such as order batching and explicit courier assignments to provide a more realistic representation of dispatching operations and improve delivery efficiency. As a solution method, we primarily focus on NeurADP, a methodology that combines Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and our work constitutes the first application of NeurADP outside of the ride-pool matching problem. NeurADP is particularly suitable for ultra-fast ODP as it addresses complex one-to-many matching and routing intricacies through a neural network-based VFA that captures high-dimensional problem dynamics without requiring manual feature engineering as in generic ADP methods. We test our proposed approach using four distinct realistic datasets tailored for ODP and compare the performance of NeurADP against myopic and DRL baselines by also making use of non-trivial bounds to assess the quality of the policies. Our numerical results indicate that the inclusion of order batching and courier queues enhances the efficiency of delivery operations and that NeurADP significantly outperforms other methods. Detailed sensitivity analysis with important parameters confirms the robustness of NeurADP under different scenarios, including variations in courier numbers, spatial setup, vehicle capacity, and permitted delay time",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic decomposition is a fundamental mid-level vision problem that plays a crucial role in various inverse rendering and computational photography pipelines. Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The concept of creating a virtual copy of a complete Cyber-Physical System opens up numerous possibilities, including real-time assessments of the physical environment and continuous learning from the system to provide reliable and precise information. This process, known as the twinning process or the development of a digital twin (DT), has been widely adopted across various industries. However, challenges arise when considering the computational demands of implementing AI models, such as those employed in digital twins, in real-time information exchange scenarios. This work proposes a digital twin framework for optimal and autonomous decision-making applied to a gas-lift process in the oil and gas industry, focusing on enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the DT. The framework combines Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo simulations, transfer learning, online learning, and novel strategies to confer cognition to the DT, including model hyperdimensional reduction and cognitive tack. Consequently, creating a framework for efficient, reliable, and trustworthy DT identification was possible. The proposed approach addresses the current gap in the literature regarding integrating various learning techniques and uncertainty management in digital twin strategies. This digital twin framework aims to provide a reliable and efficient system capable of adapting to changing environments and incorporating prediction uncertainty, thus enhancing the overall decision-making process in complex, real-world scenarios. Additionally, this work lays the foundation for further developments in digital twins for process systems engineering, potentially fostering new advancements and applications across various industrial sectors",

Besides, we further design four instruction-tuned strategies to enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection. These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple instances or hard instances, and eliminate irrelevant propagation structures, thereby achieving better detection performance. Extensive experiments further demonstrate LLMs would play a better capacity in content and propagation structure under these proposed strategies and achieve promising detection performance.

Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision language models, such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. In light of these advancements, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V, a vision language model, across a wide spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Our study assesses GPT-4V's capabilities in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, concept selection using Pugh Charts, material selection, engineering drawing analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, design for additive and subtractive manufacturing, spatial reasoning challenges, and textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore GPT-4V's proficiency in handling complex design and manufacturing challenges but also identify its limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models, emphasizing their immense potential for innovating and enhancing the engineering design and manufacturing landscape.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI) encompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss function, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI properties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim to use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and qualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making context. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model trained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of credit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector. Finally, we provide our view of the future direction of TAI research",

Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG)-based visual BCIs, known for efficient speed and calibration ease, face limitations in continuous tasks due to discrete stimulus design and decoding methods. To achieve continuous control, we implemented a novel spatial encoding stimulus paradigm and devised a corresponding projection method to enable continuous modulation of decoded velocity. Subsequently, we conducted experiments involving 17 participants and achieved Fitt's ITR of 0.55 bps for the fixed tracking task and 0.37 bps for the random tracking task. The proposed BCI with a high Fitt's ITR was then integrated into two applications, including painting and gaming. In conclusion, this study proposed a visual BCI-based control method to go beyond discrete commands, allowing natural continuous control based on neural activity",

    "abstract": "In the era of large language models generating high quality texts, it is a necessity to develop methods for detection of machine-generated text to avoid harmful use or simply due to annotation purposes. It is, however, also important to properly evaluate and compare such developed methods. Recently, a few benchmarks have been proposed for this purpose; however, integration of newest detection methods is rather challenging, since new methods appear each month and provide slightly different evaluation pipelines. In this paper, we present the IMGTB framework, which simplifies the benchmarking of machine-generated text detection methods by easy integration of custom (new) methods and evaluation datasets. Its configurability and flexibility makes research and development of new detection methods easier, especially their comparison to the existing state-of-the-art detectors.

Nonetheless, challenges persist in job scheduling for make-to-job and mass customization, necessitating further investigation to improve efficiency, reduce tardiness, promote safety and reliability.

To enhance the performance, a more condensed environment representation approach is proposed, which is designed to work with the masks made by priority dispatching rules to generate fixed and advantageous action space. Moreover, a Monte-Carlo tree search based soft shielding component is developed to help address long-sequence dependent unsafe behaviors and monitor the risk of overdue scheduling.

    "abstract": "Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as an important research field in recent years. The prevailing strategies for FL model users (MUs) assume that the entire team of the required data owners (DOs) for an FL task must be assembled before training can commence. In practice, an MU can trigger the FL training process multiple times. DOs can thus be gradually recruited over multiple FL model training sessions. Existing bidding strategies for AFL MUs are not designed to handle such scenarios. Therefore, the problem of multi-session AFL remains open. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-session Budget Optimization Strategy for forward Auction-based Federated Learning (MultiBOS-AFL). Based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, MultiBOS-AFL jointly optimizes inter-session budget pacing and intra-session bidding for AFL MUs, with the objective of maximizing the total utility. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that it significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches. On average, MultiBOS-AFL achieves 12.28% higher utility, 14.52% more data acquired through auctions for a given budget, and 1.23% higher test accuracy achieved by the resulting FL model compared to the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first budget optimization decision support method with budget pacing capability designed for MUs in multi-session forward auction-based federated learning",

To this end, we present a pretraining corpus curation and assessment platform called Oasis -- a one-stop system for data quality improvement and quantification with user-friendly interactive interfaces. Specifically, the interactive modular rule filter module can devise customized rules according to explicit feedback. The debiased neural filter module builds the quality classification dataset in a negative-centric manner to remove the undesired bias. The adaptive document deduplication module could execute large-scale deduplication with limited memory resources. These three parts constitute the customized data curation module. And in the holistic data assessment module, a corpus can be assessed in local and global views, with three evaluation means including human, GPT-4, and heuristic metrics. We exhibit a complete process to use Oasis for the curation and assessment of pretraining data. In addition, an 800GB bilingual corpus curated by Oasis is publicly released",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computational design can excite the full potential of soft robotics that has the drawbacks of being highly nonlinear from material, structure, and contact. Up to date, enthusiastic research interests have been demonstrated for individual soft fingers, but the frame design space (how each soft finger is assembled) remains largely unexplored. Computationally design remains challenging for the finger-based soft gripper to grip across multiple geometrical-distinct object types successfully. Including the design space for the gripper frame can bring huge difficulties for conventional optimisation algorithms and fitness calculation methods due to the exponential growth of high-dimensional design space. This work proposes an automated computational design optimisation framework that generates gripper diversity to individually grasp geometrically distinct object types based on a quality-diversity approach. This work first discusses a significantly large design space (28 design parameters) for a finger-based soft gripper, including the rarely-explored design space of finger arrangement that is converted to various configurations to arrange individual soft fingers. Then, a contact-based Finite Element Modelling (FEM) is proposed in SOFA to output high-fidelity grasping data for fitness evaluation and feature measurements. Finally, diverse gripper designs are obtained from the framework while considering features such as the volume and workspace of grippers. This work bridges the gap of computationally exploring the vast design space of finger-based soft grippers while grasping large geometrically distinct object types with a simple control scheme",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios",

However, their primary goal is the re-usability of these resources, and their interconnection, in the context of the Semantic Web. This paper describes the LiveSchema initiative, namely, a first version of a gateway that has the main scope of leveraging the gold mine of data collected by many existing catalogs collecting relational data like ontologies and knowledge graphs. At the current state, LiveSchema contains - 1000 datasets from 4 main sources and offers some key facilities, which allow to: i) evolving LiveSchema, by aggregating other source catalogs and repositories as input sources; ii) querying all the collected resources; iii) transforming each given dataset into formal concept analysis matrices that enable analysis and visualization services; iv) generating models and tensors from each given dataset",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM)-based speech synthesis has been widely adopted in zero-shot speech synthesis. However, they require a large-scale data and possess the same limitations as previous autoregressive speech models, including slow inference speed and lack of robustness. This paper proposes HierSpeech++, a fast and strong zero-shot speech synthesizer for text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). We verified that hierarchical speech synthesis frameworks could significantly improve the robustness and expressiveness of the synthetic speech. Furthermore, we significantly improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of synthetic speech even in zero-shot speech synthesis scenarios. For text-to-speech, we adopt the text-to-vec framework, which generates a self-supervised speech representation and an F0 representation based on text representations and prosody prompts. Then, HierSpeech++ generates speech from the generated vector, F0, and voice prompt. We further introduce a high-efficient speech super-resolution framework from 16 kHz to 48 kHz. The experimental results demonstrated that the hierarchical variational autoencoder could be a strong zero-shot speech synthesizer given that it outperforms LLM-based and diffusion-based models. Moreover, we achieved the first human-level quality zero-shot speech synthesis. Audio samples and source code are available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/HierSpeechpp",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework for achieving long-term group fairness in dynamical systems, in which current decisions may affect an individual's features in the next step, and thus, future decisions. Specifically, our framework allows us to identify a time-independent policy that converges, if deployed, to the targeted fair stationary state of the system in the long term, independently of the initial data distribution. We model the system dynamics with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimize the policy leveraging the Markov chain convergence theorem to ensure unique convergence. We provide examples of different targeted fair states of the system, encompassing a range of long-term goals for society and policymakers. Furthermore, we show how our approach facilitates the evaluation of different long-term targets by examining their impact on the group-conditional population distribution in the long term and how it evolves until convergence",

Via semantic KB, source messages can be characterized in low-dimensional subspaces without compromising their desired meaning, thus significantly enhancing the communication efficiency. The fundamental principle of semantic KB is first introduced, and a generative semantic communication architecture is developed by presenting three sub-KBs, namely source, task, and channel KBs. Then, the detailed construction approaches for each sub-KB are described, followed by their utilization in terms of semantic coding and transmission.

We address this question by exploring how TRACX2, (French et al., 2011; French \\& Cottrell, 2014; Mareschal \\& French, 2017), a recognition-based, recursive connectionist autoencoder model of chunking and sequence segmentation, which has successfully simulated speech and serial-image processing, might be applied to elementary melody perception. The model, a three-layer autoencoder that recognizes ''chunks'' of short sequences of intervals that have been frequently encountered on input, is trained on the tone intervals of melodically simple French children's songs. It dynamically incorporates the internal representations of these chunks into new input. Its internal representations cluster in a manner that is consistent with ''human-recognizable'' melodic categories. TRACX2 is sensitive to both contour and proximity information in the musical chunks that it encounters in its input. It shows the ''end-of-word'' superiority effect demonstrated by Saffran et al.

The overall findings suggest that the recursive autoassociative chunking mechanism, as implemented in TRACX2, may be a general segmentation and chunking mechanism, underlying not only word-and imagechunking, but also elementary melody processing",

    "abstract": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two additional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart simple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on some of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is performance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of the evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional training datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of our evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and 25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change in performance",

In recent months, LLMs have shown widespread attention in autonomous driving and map systems. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors to apply in LLM driving systems. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation in this field. We first introduce the background of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the multimodal models development using LLMs, and the history of autonomous driving. Then, we overview existing MLLM tools for driving, transportation, and map systems together with existing datasets and benchmarks. Moreover, we summarized the works in The 1st WACV Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD), which is the first workshop of its kind regarding LLMs in autonomous driving. To further promote the development of this field, we also discuss several important problems regarding using MLLMs in autonomous driving systems that need to be solved by both academia and industry",

Leveraging deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis. However, developing a reliable model generally necessitates substantial data for training, which is challenging in pathological field. In response, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance. Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and supportable for further pathology-related research",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the fundamental statistics course, students are taught to remember the well-known saying: \"Correlation is not Causation\". Till now, statistics (i.e., correlation) have developed various successful frameworks, such as Transformer and Pre-training large-scale models, which have stacked multiple parallel self-attention blocks to imitate a wide range of tasks. However, in the causation community, how to build an integrated causal framework still remains an untouched domain despite its excellent intervention capabilities. In this paper, we propose the Causal Graph Routing (CGR) framework, an integrated causal scheme relying entirely on the intervention mechanisms to reveal the cause-effect forces hidden in data. Specifically, CGR is composed of a stack of causal layers. Each layer includes a set of parallel deconfounding blocks from different causal graphs. We combine these blocks via the concept of the proposed sufficient cause, which allows the model to dynamically select the suitable deconfounding methods in each layer. CGR is implemented as the stacked networks, integrating no confounder, back-door adjustment, front-door adjustment, and probability of sufficient cause. We evaluate this framework on two classical tasks of CV and NLP. Experiments show CGR can surpass the current state-of-the-art methods on both Visual Question Answer and Long Document Classification tasks. In particular, CGR has great potential in building the \"causal\" pre-training large-scale model that effectively generalizes to diverse tasks. It will improve the machines' comprehension of causal relationships within a broader semantic space",

First, to explore model-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the RE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards the first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis of TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from the instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the second objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to automatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and reannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is based on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used false-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our second approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean subset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally, we retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset. Our empirical results based on two SOTA models trained on TACRED-E following the IS show an average 4% F1-score improvement, whereas reannotation (TACRED-R) does not improve the original results. However, following ES, SOTA models show the average F1-score improvement of 3.8% and 4.4% when trained on respective eliminated (TACRED-EN) and reannotated (TACRED-RN) datasets respectively. We further extended the ES for cleaning positive examples as well, which resulted in an average performance improvement of 5.8% and 5.6% for the eliminated (TACRED-ENP) and reannotated (TACRED-RNP) datasets respectively",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship, etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g., Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that include science question-answering and scientific document classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy",

We explore methodologies to optimize the retrieval process, select optimal models, and effectively scale and orchestrate LLMs, aiming for cost-efficiency and enhanced result accuracy. A notable challenge, model hallucination-where the model yields inaccurate or misinterpreted data-is addressed alongside other model-specific hurdles. Our discourse extends to crucial considerations including user privacy, data optimization, and the necessity for system clarity and interpretability.

Such disturbances are modeled as the \"unknown\" part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. First, we expand upon the notion of \"regularizability\" and characterize this system characteristic for a linear time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded higher-order terms. \"Rapid-regularizability\" then gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior. We then propose the Data-Guided Regulation for Adaptive Nonlinear Control ( DG-RAN) algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of adverse environmental disturbances",

We implement FIP for the first time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget.

Other methods that produce a distribution over node label assignment in trees (or more generally in graphs) either assume conditional independence of the label assignment, operate on a fixed graph topology, or require part of the node labels to be observed. Our method defines a Markov Network with the corresponding topology of the random tree and an associated Gibbs distribution. We parameterize the Gibbs distribution with a Graph Neural Network that operates on the random tree and the node embeddings. This allows us to estimate the likelihood of node assignments for a given random tree and use MCMC to sample from the distribution of node assignments.

Video summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input. The proposed video summarization method incorporates the above innovative design choices that aim to narrow the gap between human-generated and machine-generated video summaries. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on commonly used video summarization datasets",

    "title": "Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on adapting RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and moreover enables more aggressive quantization. For example, on the OpenAssistant benchmark LQ-LoRA is able to learn a 2.5-bit LLaMA-2 model that is competitive with a model finetuned with 4-bit QLoRA. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) is competitive with the original model in full precision",

    "title": "Weak-Form Latent Space Dynamics Identification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent work in data-driven modeling has demonstrated that a weak formulation of model equations enhances the noise robustness of a wide range of computational methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of the weak form to enhance the LaSDI (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) algorithm, a recently developed data-driven reduced order modeling technique. We introduce a weak form-based version WLaSDI (Weak-form Latent Space Dynamics Identification). WLaSDI first compresses data, then projects onto the test functions and learns the local latent space models. Notably, WLaSDI demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise. With WLaSDI, the local latent space is obtained using weak-form equation learning techniques. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) used in LaSDI, the variance reduction of the weak form guarantees a robust and precise latent space recovery, hence allowing for a fast, robust, and accurate simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of WLaSDI vs. LaSDI on several common benchmark examples including viscid and inviscid Burgers', radial advection, and heat conduction. For instance, in the case of 1D inviscid Burgers' simulations with the addition of up to 100% Gaussian white noise, the relative error remains consistently below 6% for WLaSDI, while it can exceed 10,000% for LaSDI. Similarly, for radial advection simulations, the relative errors stay below 15% for WLaSDI, in stark contrast to the potential errors of up to 10,000% with LaSDI. Moreover, speedups of several orders of magnitude can be obtained with WLaSDI. For example applying WLaSDI to 1D Burgers' yields a 140X speedup compared to the corresponding full order model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Designing a perfect reward function that depicts all the aspects of the intended behavior is almost impossible, especially generalizing it outside of the training environments. Active Inverse Reward Design (AIRD) proposed the use of a series of queries, comparing possible reward functions in a single training environment. This allows the human to give information to the agent about suboptimal behaviors, in order to compute a probability distribution over the intended reward function. However, it ignores the possibility of unknown features appearing in real-world environments, and the safety measures needed until the agent completely learns the reward function. I improved this method and created Risk-averse Batch Active Inverse Reward Design (RBAIRD), which constructs batches, sets of environments the agent encounters when being used in the real world, processes them sequentially, and, for a predetermined number of iterations, asks queries that the human needs to answer for each environment of the batch. After this process is completed in one batch, the probabilities have been improved and are transferred to the next batch. This makes it capable of adapting to real-world scenarios and learning how to treat unknown features it encounters for the first time. I also integrated a risk-averse planner, similar to that of Inverse Reward Design (IRD), which samples a set of reward functions from the probability distribution and computes a trajectory that takes the most certain rewards possible. This ensures safety while the agent is still learning the reward function, and enables the use of this approach in situations where cautiousness is vital. RBAIRD outperformed the previous approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and action certainty, demonstrated quick adaptability to new, unknown features, and can be more widely used for the alignment of crucial, powerful AI models",

Yet, a largely unexplored facet of this paradigm is its susceptibility to adversarial attacks, especially with the aim of inducing forgetting. In this paper, we introduce \"BrainWash,\" a novel data poisoning method tailored to impose forgetting on a continual learner. By adding the BrainWash noise to a variety of baselines, we demonstrate how a trained continual learner can be induced to forget its previously learned tasks catastrophically, even when using these continual learning baselines. An important feature of our approach is that the attacker requires no access to previous tasks' data and is armed merely with the model's current parameters and the data belonging to the most recent task.

The aim of this study is to compare state-of-the-art lip segmentation models using a standardized setting and a publicly available dataset. Five techniques, namely EHANet, Mask2Former, BiSeNet V2, PIDNet, and STDC1, are qualitatively selected based on their reported performance, inference time, code availability, recency, and popularity. The CelebAMask-HQ dataset, comprising manually annotated face images, is used to fairly assess the lip segmentation performance of the selected models. Inference experiments are conducted on a Raspberry Pi4 to emulate limited computational resources. The results show that Mask2Former and EHANet have the best performances in terms of mIoU score. BiSeNet V2 demonstrate competitive performance, while PIDNet excels in recall but has lower precision. Most models present inference time ranging from 1000 to around 3000 milliseconds on a Raspberry Pi4, with PIDNet having the lowest mean inference time. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of lip segmentation models, highlighting their performance and inference times.

Facial expressions can be very useful for emotion recognition techniques, as these are the biggest transmitters of non-verbal cues capable of being correlated with emotions. Several techniques are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract information in a machine learning process. However, simple CNNs are not always sufficient to locate points of interest on the face that can be correlated with emotions. In this work, we intend to expand the capacity of emotion recognition techniques by proposing the usage of Facial Action Units (AUs) recognition techniques to recognize emotions. This recognition will be based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and computed by a machine learning system. In particular, our method expands over EmotiRAM, an approach for multi-cue emotion recognition, in which we improve over their facial encoding module",

AODE usually improves NB in accuracy, but suffers from high spatial complexity since $k$ models, each with $n+1$ variables, are included in the AODE ensemble. In this paper, we propose MiniAnDE, an algorithm that includes only a small number of heterogeneous base classifiers in the ensemble, i.e., each model only includes a different subset of the $k$ predictive variables.

Prior theoretical work studying risk-sensitive RL focuses on the tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) setting. To extend CVaR RL to settings where state space is large, function approximation must be deployed. We study CVaR RL in low-rank MDPs with nonlinear function approximation. Low-rank MDPs assume the underlying transition kernel admits a low-rank decomposition, but unlike prior linear models, low-rank MDPs do not assume the feature or state-action representation is known. We propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bonus-driven algorithm to carefully balance the interplay between exploration, exploitation, and representation learning in CVaR RL. We prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{H^7 A^2 d^4}{\\tau^2 \\epsilon^2}\\right)$ to yield an $\\epsilon$-optimal CVaR, where $H$ is the length of each episode, $A$ is the capacity of action space, and $d$ is the dimension of representations. Computational-wise, we design a novel discretized Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm for the CVaR objective as the planning oracle and show that we can find the near-optimal policy in a polynomial running time with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation oracle.

    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) analysis prevails in real-world applications such as finance, climate science and healthcare. The various self-attention mechanisms, the backbone of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, efficiently discover the temporal dependencies, yet cannot well capture the intricate cross-correlation between different features of MTS data, which inherently stems from complex dynamical systems in practice. To this end, we propose a novel correlated attention mechanism, which not only efficiently captures feature-wise dependencies, but can also be seamlessly integrated within the encoder blocks of existing well-known Transformers to gain efficiency improvement. In particular, correlated attention operates across feature channels to compute cross-covariance matrices between queries and keys with different lag values, and selectively aggregate representations at the sub-series level. This architecture facilitates automated discovery and representation learning of not only instantaneous but also lagged cross-correlations, while inherently capturing time series auto-correlation. When combined with prevalent Transformer baselines, correlated attention mechanism constitutes a better alternative for encoder-only architectures, which are suitable for a wide range of tasks including imputation, anomaly detection and classification. Extensive experiments on the aforementioned tasks consistently underscore the advantages of correlated attention mechanism in enhancing base Transformer models, and demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in imputation, anomaly detection and classification",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating entropy-regularized optimal transport (EOT) maps with squared-Euclidean cost between source and target measures that are subGaussian. In the case that the target measure is compactly supported or strongly log-concave, we show that for a recently proposed in-sample estimator, the expected squared $L^2$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/3})$ where $n$ is the sample size. For the general subGaussian case we show that the expected $L^1$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/6})$, and in both cases we have polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter. While these results are suboptimal compared to known results in the case of compactness of both the source and target measures (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1})$) and for when the source is subGaussian while the target is compactly supported (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1/2})$), their importance lie in eliminating the compact support requirements. The proof technique makes use of a bias-variance decomposition where the variance is controlled using standard concentration of measure results and the bias is handled by T1-transport inequalities along with sample complexity results in estimation of EOT cost under subGaussian assumptions. Our experimental results point to a looseness in controlling the variance terms and we conclude by posing several open problems",

Only studies published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country. - Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and - The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only 2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability",

    "abstract": "The ability to construct a realistic simulator of financial exchanges, including reproducing the dynamics of the limit order book, can give insight into many counterfactual scenarios, such as a flash crash, a margin call, or changes in macroeconomic outlook. In recent years, agent-based models have been developed that reproduce many features of an exchange, as summarised by a set of stylised facts and statistics. However, the ability to calibrate simulators to a specific period of trading remains an open challenge. In this work, we develop a novel approach to the calibration of market simulators by leveraging recent advances in deep learning, specifically using neural density estimators and embedding networks. We demonstrate that our approach is able to correctly identify high probability parameter sets, both when applied to synthetic and historical data, and without reliance on manually selected or weighted ensembles of stylised facts",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Providing formal guarantees of algorithmic fairness is of paramount importance to socially responsible deployment of machine learning algorithms. In this work, we study formal guarantees, i.e., certificates, for individual fairness (IF) of neural networks. We start by introducing a novel convex approximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational cost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight that prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification and can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus limiting their practical impact. We propose to certify distributional individual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and all distributions within a $\\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has guaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in quasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on distributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to certify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude larger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world distribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound source of IF guarantees",

    "title": "Continual Learning: Applications and the Road Forward",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful. This work is the result of the many discussions the authors had at the Dagstuhl seminar on Deep Continual Learning, in March 2023",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) are crucial in modern air defense systems. A critical aspect of their effectiveness is the Engagement Zone (EZ), the spatial region within which a SAM can effectively engage and neutralize a target. Notably, the EZ is intrinsically related to the missile's maximum range; it defines the furthest distance at which a missile can intercept a target. The accurate computation of this EZ is essential but challenging due to the dynamic and complex factors involved, which often lead to high computational costs and extended processing times when using conventional simulation methods. In light of these challenges, our study investigates the potential of machine learning techniques, proposing an approach that integrates machine learning with a custom-designed simulation tool to train supervised algorithms. We leverage a comprehensive dataset of pre-computed SAM EZ simulations, enabling our model to accurately predict the SAM EZ for new input parameters. It accelerates SAM EZ simulations, enhances air defense strategic planning, and provides real-time insights, improving SAM system performance. The study also includes a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, illuminating their capabilities and performance metrics and suggesting areas for future research, highlighting the transformative potential of machine learning in SAM EZ simulations",

    "title": "LLMs as Visual Explainers: Advancing Image Classification with Evolving Visual Descriptions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "title": "Measuring and Mitigating Biases in Motor Insurance Pricing",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The non-life insurance sector operates within a highly competitive and tightly regulated framework, confronting a pivotal juncture in the formulation of pricing strategies. Insurers are compelled to harness a range of statistical methodologies and available data to construct optimal pricing structures that align with the overarching corporate strategy while accommodating the dynamics of market competition. Given the fundamental societal role played by insurance, premium rates are subject to rigorous scrutiny by regulatory authorities. These rates must conform to principles of transparency, explainability, and ethical considerations. Consequently, the act of pricing transcends mere statistical calculations and carries the weight of strategic and societal factors. These multifaceted concerns may drive insurers to establish equitable premiums, taking into account various variables. For instance, regulations mandate the provision of equitable premiums, considering factors such as policyholder gender or mutualist group dynamics in accordance with respective corporate strategies. Age-based premium fairness is also mandated. In certain insurance domains, variables such as the presence of serious illnesses or disabilities are emerging as new dimensions for evaluating fairness. Regardless of the motivating factor prompting an insurer to adopt fairer pricing strategies for a specific variable, the insurer must possess the capability to define, measure, and ultimately mitigate any ethical biases inherent in its pricing practices while upholding standards of consistency and performance. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive set of tools for these endeavors and assess their effectiveness through practical application in the context of automobile insurance",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In real-world scenarios, although data entities may possess inherent relationships, the specific graph illustrating their connections might not be directly accessible. Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in previous literature on latent graph inference",

    "title": "Multi-Task Faces (MTF) Data Set: A Legally and Ethically Compliant Collection of Face Images for Various Classification Tasks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet. The reported results constitute a baseline for further research employing these data.

    "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used in the design and optimization of gas turbines and many other industrial/ scientific applications. However, the practical use is often limited by the high computational cost, and the accurate resolution of near-wall flow is a significant contributor to this cost. Machine learning (ML) and other data-driven methods can complement existing wall models. Nevertheless, training these models is bottlenecked by the large computational effort and memory footprint demanded by back-propagation. Recent work has presented alternatives for computing gradients of neural networks where a separate forward and backward sweep is not needed and storage of intermediate results between sweeps is not required because an unbiased estimator for the gradient is computed in a single forward sweep. In this paper, we discuss the application of this approach for training a subgrid wall model that could potentially be used as a surrogate in wall-bounded flow CFD simulations to reduce the computational overhead while preserving predictive accuracy",

Advancements in sensor technology enable the capture of movement in real-life environments and generate big data. Machine learning, notably deep learning (DL), shows promise to use these big data in gait analysis. However, the inherent black-box nature of these models poses challenges for their clinical application. This study aims to enhance transparency in DL-based gait classification for aged-related gait patterns using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, such as SHAP. A total of 244 subjects, comprising 129 adults and 115 older adults (age>65), were included. They performed a 3-minute walking task while accelerometers were affixed to the lumbar segment L3. DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was employed to explain the models' predictions. CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally. CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between different age groups",

We derive tailored, parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against perturbations in the input data. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly depends on the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings as frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. With numerical results, we demonstrate that, indeed, Lipschitz bound regularization leads to substantially more robust and generalizable quantum models",

    "abstract": "Human Assumed Central Sensitization is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was developed to evaluate the presence of HACS, with a cut-off value of 40/100 based on patients with chronic pain. However, various factors including pain conditions (e.g., CLBP), and gender may influence this cut-off value. For chronic pain condition such as CLBP, unsupervised clustering approaches can take these factors into consideration and automatically learn the HACS-related patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the cut-off values for a Dutch-speaking population with CLBP, considering the total group and stratified by gender based on unsupervised machine learning. In this study, questionnaire data covering pain, physical, and psychological aspects were collected from patients with CLBP and aged-matched pain-free adults (referred to as healthy controls, HC). Four clustering approaches were applied to identify HACS-related clusters based on the questionnaire data and gender. The clustering performance was assessed using internal and external indicators. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted on the best clustering results to determine the optimal cut-off values. The study included 151 subjects, consisting of 63 HCs and 88 patients with CLBP. Hierarchical clustering yielded the best results, identifying three clusters: healthy group, CLBP with low HACS level, and CLBP with high HACS level groups. Based on the low HACS levels group (including HC and CLBP with low HACS level) and high HACS level group, the cut-off value for the overall groups were 35, 34 for females, and 35 for. The findings suggest that the optimal cut-off values for CLBP is 35. The gender-related cut-off values should be interpreted with caution due to the unbalanced gender distribution in the sample",

In this work, we first investigate the concentration property of $\\mathsf{RR}$'s sampling procedure and establish a new high probability sample complexity guarantee for driving the gradient (without expectation) below $\\varepsilon$, which effectively characterizes the efficiency of a single $\\mathsf{RR}$ execution. Our derived complexity matches the best existing in-expectation one up to a logarithmic term while imposing no additional assumptions nor changing $\\mathsf{RR}$'s updating rule. Furthermore, by leveraging our derived high probability descent property and bound on the stochastic error, we propose a simple and computable stopping criterion for $\\mathsf{RR}$ (denoted as $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$). This criterion is guaranteed to be triggered after a finite number of iterations, and then $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$ returns an iterate with its gradient below $\\varepsilon$ with high probability. Moreover, building on the proposed stopping criterion, we design a perturbed random reshuffling method ($\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$) that involves an additional randomized perturbation procedure near stationary points. We derive that $\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$ provably escapes strict saddle points and efficiently returns a second-order stationary point with high probability, without making any sub-Gaussian tail-type assumptions on the stochastic gradient errors.

    "title": "Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Efficient Calibration of Image Segmentation Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

    "title": "Few-shot Multispectral Segmentation with Representations Generated by Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The task of multispectral image segmentation (segmentation of images with numerous channels/bands, each capturing a specific range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation) has been previously explored in contexts with large amounts of labeled data. However, these models tend not to generalize well to datasets of smaller size. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several multispectral datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting the performance of segmentation algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning using large models have achieved great success in a wide range of domains. However, training these models on billions of parameters is very challenging in terms of the training speed, memory cost, and communication efficiency, especially under the privacy-preserving regime with differential privacy (DP). On the one hand, DP optimization has comparable efficiency to the standard non-private optimization on a single GPU, but on multiple GPUs, existing DP distributed learning (such as pipeline parallel) has suffered from significantly worse efficiency. On the other hand, the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) is a state-of-the-art solution to the standard distributed learning, exhibiting excellent training efficiency on large models, but to work compatibly with DP is technically complicated. In this work, we develop a new systematic solution, DP-ZeRO, (I) to scale up the trainable DP model size, e.g. to GPT-100B, (II) to obtain the same computation and communication efficiency as the standard ZeRO, and (III) to enable mixed-precision DP training. Our DP-ZeRO, like the standard ZeRO, has the potential to train models with arbitrary size and is evaluated on the world's largest DP models in terms of the number of trainable parameters",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph representation learning is fundamental for analyzing graph-structured data. Exploring invariant graph representations remains a challenge for most existing graph representation learning methods. In this paper, we propose a cross-view graph consistency learning (CGCL) method that learns invariant graph representations for link prediction. First, two complementary augmented views are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical CGCL analysis. This paper empirically and experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CGCL method, achieving competitive results on graph datasets in comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "4D Flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (4D Flow MRI) is a non-invasive measurement technique capable of quantifying blood flow across the cardiovascular system. While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces LogLead, a tool designed for efficient log analysis. LogLead combines three essential steps in log processing: loading, enhancing, and anomaly detection. The tool leverages Polars, a high-speed DataFrame library. We currently have 7 Loaders out of which 4 is for public data sets (HDFS, Hadoop, BGL, and Thunderbird). We have multiple enhancers with three parsers (Drain, Spell, LenMa), Bert embedding creation and other log representation techniques like bag-of-words. LogLead integrates to 5 supervised and 4 unsupervised machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection from SKLearn. By integrating diverse datasets, log representation methods and anomaly detectors, LogLead facilitates comprehensive benchmarking in log analysis research. We demonstrate that log loading from raw file to dataframe is over 10x faster with LogLead is compared to past solutions. We demonstrate roughly 2x improvement in Drain parsing speed by off-loading log message normalization to LogLead. We demonstrate a brief benchmarking on HDFS suggesting that log representations beyond bag-of-words provide limited benefits. Screencast demonstrating the tool: https://youtu.be/8stdbtTfJVo",

    "abstract": "Partial differential equations are often used in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems in many engineering applications. In this work, we build on the recent progress of operator learning and present a data-driven modeling framework that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the proposed model is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the spatial-temporal continuous learning framework with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we consider a `cooperative' multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) involving m greater than 1 agents, where all agents are aware of the system model. At each decision epoch, all the m agents cooperatively select actions in order to maximize a common long-term objective. Since the number of actions grows exponentially in the number of agents, policy improvement is computationally expensive. Recent works have proposed using decentralized policy improvement in which each agent assumes that the decisions of the other agents are fixed and it improves its decisions unilaterally. Yet, in these works, exact values are computed. In our work, for cooperative multi-agent finite and infinite horizon discounted MDPs, we propose suitable approximate policy iteration algorithms, wherein we use approximate linear programming to compute the approximate value function and use decentralized policy improvement. Thus our algorithms can handle both large number of states as well as multiple agents. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithms and also demonstrate the performance of our algorithms on some numerical examples",

    "title": "Robust Tumor Segmentation with Hyperspectral Imaging and Graph Neural Networks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

    "abstract": "Recent studies attempted to utilize multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to solve semi-supervised node classification on graphs, by training a student MLP by knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher graph neural network (GNN). While previous studies have focused mostly on training the student MLP by matching the output probability distributions between the teacher and student models during KD, it has not been systematically studied how to inject the structural information in an explicit and interpretable manner. Inspired by GNNs that separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\\Pi$, we re-frame the KD process as enabling the student MLP to explicitly learn both $T$ and $\\Pi$. Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$ before distillation from the teacher GNN, it still comes with a high computational cost from large matrix multiplications during training. To solve this problem, we propose Propagate & Distill (P&D), which propagates the output of the teacher GNN before KD and can be interpreted as an approximate process of the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$. Through comprehensive evaluations using real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of P&D by showing further performance boost of the student MLP",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. In this study, we introduce a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thus facilitating the simulation of diverse spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications",

In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the dependence of model score estimation bias on both uncertainty and score itself. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection in terms of both model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a key property to protect data and models from integrity attacks. In the Deep Learning (DL) field, it is commonly implemented through the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). However, when a model is shared or released, there is no way to check whether it is differentially private, that is, it required to trust the model provider. This situation poses a problem when data privacy is mandatory, specially with current data regulations, as the presence of DP can not be certificated consistently by any third party. Thus, we face the challenge of determining whether a DL model has been trained with DP, according to the title question: Can we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models' weights? Since the DP-SGD significantly changes the training process of a DL model, we hypothesize that DP leaves an imprint in the weights of a DL model, which can be used to predict whether a model has been trained with DP regardless of its architecture and the training dataset. In this paper, we propose to employ the imprint in model weights of using DP to infer the presence of DP training in a DL model. To substantiate our hypothesis, we developed an experimental methodology based on two datasets of weights of DL models, each with models with and without DP training and a meta-classifier to infer whether DP was used in the training process of a DL model, by accessing its weights. We accomplish both, the removal of the requirement of a trusted model provider and a strong foundation for this interesting line of research. Thus, our contribution is an additional layer of security on top of the strict private requirements of DP training in DL models, towards to DL models",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time",

    "title": "Unveiling the Power of Self-Attention for Shipping Cost Prediction: The Rate Card Transformer",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Amazon ships billions of packages to its customers annually within the United States. Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0) to estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0 profitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies and delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost estimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or fixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high, or promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for estimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require extensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel architecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to encode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier information and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT has the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a shipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For example, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results demonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82% less error compared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08%. We also illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card that can improve the performance of tree-based models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Accelerating compute intensive non-real-time beam-forming algorithms in ultrasound imaging using deep learning architectures has been gaining momentum in the recent past. Nonetheless, the complexity of the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques poses challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this work, we propose a novel vision transformer based tiny beamformer (Tiny-VBF), which works on the raw radio-frequency channel data acquired through single-angle plane wave insonification. The output of our Tiny-VBF provides fast envelope detection requiring very low frame rate, i.e. 0.34 GOPs/Frame for a frame size of 368 x 128 in comparison to the state-of-the-art deep learning models. It also exhibited an 8% increase in contrast and gains of 5% and 33% in axial and lateral resolution respectively when compared to Tiny-CNN on in-vitro dataset. Additionally, our model showed a 4.2% increase in contrast and gains of 4% and 20% in axial and lateral resolution respectively when compared against conventional Delay-and-Sum (DAS) beamformer. We further propose an accelerator architecture and implement our Tiny-VBF model on a Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 FPGA using a hybrid quantization scheme with 50% less resource consumption compared to the floating-point implementation, while preserving the image quality",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection is a popular approach for the analysis of neuroimaging data as it allows to identify a wide variety of anomalies from unlabelled data. It relies on building a subject-specific model of healthy appearance to which a subject's image can be compared to detect anomalies. In the literature, it is common for anomaly detection to rely on analysing the residual image between the subject's image and its pseudo-healthy reconstruction. This approach however has limitations partly due to the pseudo-healthy reconstructions being imperfect and to the lack of natural thresholding mechanism. Our proposed method, inspired by Z-scores, leverages the healthy population variability to overcome these limitations. Our experiments conducted on FDG PET scans from the ADNI database demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying Alzheimer's disease related anomalies",

More often, a sophisticated digital twin is available, which is a highly complex model that is a virtual representation of a given physical process, whose parameters may not be properly tuned to capture the variations in the physical process. In this paper, we present a sim2real, direct data-driven controller tuning approach, where the digital twin is used to generate input-output data and suitable controllers for several perturbations in its parameters. State-of-the art neural-network architectures are then used to learn the controller tuning rule that maps input-output data onto the controller parameters, based on artificially generated data from perturbed versions of the digital twin. In this way, as far as we are aware, we tackle for the first time the problem of re-calibrating the controller by meta-learning the tuning rule directly from data, thus practically replacing the control engineer with a machine learning model.

This problem is challenging due to the lack of paired video datasets maintaining temporal consistency in identity and age. Most re-aging methods process each image individually without considering the temporal consistency of videos. While some existing works address the issue of temporal coherence through video facial attribute manipulation in latent space, they often fail to deliver satisfactory performance in age transformation. To tackle the issues, we propose (1) a novel synthetic video dataset that features subjects across a diverse range of age groups; (2) a baseline architecture designed to validate the effectiveness of our proposed dataset, and (3) the development of three novel metrics tailored explicitly for evaluating the temporal consistency of video re-aging techniques. Our comprehensive experiments on public datasets, such as VFHQ and CelebV-HQ, show that our method outperforms the existing approaches in terms of both age transformation and temporal consistency",

We use glaucoma diagnosis based on color fundus images as an example to show the possibility of performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations. Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks. Memory limitations and low processing capabilities of embedded accelerated systems (EAS) limit their use for deep network-based system training. However, including specific acceleration hardware, such as NVIDIA's Maxwell GPU or Google's Edge TPU, enables them to perform inferences using complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times. In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC) segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms using Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively. Regarding energy usage, in approximate terms, for OD segmentation Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 38 and 190 mJ per image, respectively. For fundus classification, Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs use 45 and 70 mJ, respectively",

Ideally, these classifiers encode the salient features indicative for each disease class and can steer the diffusion model to show realistic disease signs or remove disease-related lesions in a realistic way.

    "abstract": "The challenge of collision-free navigation (CFN) for self-driving cars is an NP-hard problem addressed through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Despite the effectiveness of DRL methods, their application demands significant computing resources and prolonged training periods to establish a resilient agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning algorithms have recently demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple, non-real-world environments. However, their application in the real-world CFN domain has not been explored, and their direct adaptation would require a quantum computing device onboard the vehicle for testing. In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation for improving the training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware. Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator, a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our empirical evaluations showcase that Nav-Q surpasses its classical counterpart not only in terms of training stability but also, in certain instances, with respect to the convergence rate when analyzing the Reward vs. Episode curve. This enhancement is accomplished without negatively impacting the learned policy by the agent. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a model possessing greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines. Finally, we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation, observing that the quantum noise enhances the exploratory tendencies of the agent during training",

This technology has vast applications in biotechnology and biomedicine but faces significant computational bottlenecks. Current methodologies often require multiple hours or even days to process extensive datasets, particularly in the domain of spectral clustering. To tackle these inefficiencies, we introduce SpecHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework supplemented by an FPGA-accelerated architecture with integrated near-storage preprocessing. Utilizing streamlined binary operations in an HDC environment, SpecHD capitalizes on the low-latency and parallel capabilities of FPGAs. This approach markedly improves clustering speed and efficiency, serving as a catalyst for real-time, high-throughput data analysis in future healthcare applications. Our evaluations demonstrate that SpecHD not only maintains but often surpasses existing clustering quality metrics while drastically cutting computational time. Specifically, it can cluster a large-scale human proteome dataset-comprising 25 million MS/MS spectra and 131 GB of MS data-in just 5 minutes. With energy efficiency exceeding 31x and a speedup factor that spans a range of 6x to 54x over existing state of-the-art solutions, SpecHD emerges as a promising solution for the rapid analysis of mass spectrometry data with great implications for personalized healthcare",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods",

However, diffusion models are generally slow in sampling and state-of-the-art acceleration techniques can lead to sub-optimal results when directly applied to the controllable generation process. This study introduces a new algorithm called Predictor-Projector-Noisor (PPN), which enhances and accelerates controllable generation of diffusion models for MRI undersampling reconstruction. Our results demonstrate that PPN produces high-fidelity MR images that conform to undersampled k-space measurements with significantly shorter reconstruction time than other controllable sampling methods.

    "title": "Understanding Variation in Subpopulation Susceptibility to Poisoning Attacks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations.

Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor prediction. It can assist radiologists in their diagnosis and treatment planning. The proposed system achieved a high accuracy of 95.5% in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Accurate spelling correction is a critical step in modern search interfaces, especially in an era of mobile devices and speech-to-text interfaces. For services that are deployed around the world, this poses a significant challenge for multilingual NLP: spelling errors need to be caught and corrected in all languages, and even in queries that use multiple languages. In this paper, we tackle this challenge using multi-teacher distillation. On our approach, a monolingual teacher model is trained for each language/locale, and these individual models are distilled into a single multilingual student model intended to serve all languages/locales. In experiments using open-source data as well as user data from a worldwide search service, we show that this leads to highly effective spelling correction models that can meet the tight latency requirements of deployed services",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have emerged as pivotal tools in various applications. However, these models are susceptible to adversarial prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that lead to undesirable outputs. The inherent vulnerability of LLMs stems from their input-output mechanisms, especially when presented with intensely out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This paper proposes a token-level detection method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. As a result, we propose two methods: one that identifies each token as either being part of an adversarial prompt or not, and another that estimates the probability of each token being part of an adversarial prompt",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "LoRA achieves remarkable resource efficiency and comparable performance when adapting LLMs for specific tasks. Since ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance on various tasks, there has been a growing desire to adapt one model for all tasks. However, the explicit low-rank of LoRA limits the adaptation performance in complex multi-task scenarios. LoRA is dominated by a small number of top singular vectors while fine-tuning decomposes into a set of less important unitary transforms. In this paper, we propose MultiLoRA for better multi-task adaptation by reducing the dominance of top singular vectors observed in LoRA. MultiLoRA scales LoRA modules horizontally and change parameter initialization of adaptation matrices to reduce parameter dependency, thus yields more balanced unitary subspaces. We unprecedentedly construct specialized training data by mixing datasets of instruction follow, natural language understanding, world knowledge, to cover semantically and syntactically different samples. With only 2.5% of additional parameters, MultiLoRA outperforms single LoRA counterparts and fine-tuning on multiple benchmarks and model scales. Further investigation into weight update matrices of MultiLoRA exhibits reduced dependency on top singular vectors and more democratic unitary transform contributions",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing learning methods often struggle to balance interpretability and predictive performance. While models like nearest neighbors and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) offer high interpretability, their predictive performance on supervised learning tasks is often limited. In contrast, neural networks based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) support the modular construction of expressive architectures and tend to have better recognition accuracy but are often regarded as black boxes in terms of interpretability. Our approach aims to strike a better balance between these two aspects through the use of a building block based on NMF that incorporates supervised neural network training methods to achieve high predictive performance while retaining the desirable interpretability properties of NMF. We evaluate our Predictive Factorized Coupling (PFC) block on small datasets and show that it achieves competitive predictive performance with MLPs while also offering improved interpretability. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in various scenarios, such as continual learning, training on non-i.i.d. data, and knowledge removal after training. Additionally, we show examples of using the PFC block to build more expressive architectures, including a fully-connected residual network as well as a factorized recurrent neural network (RNN) that performs competitively with vanilla RNNs while providing improved interpretability. The PFC block uses an iterative inference algorithm that converges to a fixed point, making it possible to trade off accuracy vs computation after training but also currently preventing its use as a general MLP replacement in some scenarios such as training on very large datasets.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks, making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$ matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI",

In this work, we aim to address this gap by investigating the well-posedness of simulation-free continuous normalizing flows built on Gaussian denoising. Through a unified framework termed Gaussian interpolation flow, we establish the Lipschitz regularity of the flow velocity field, the existence and uniqueness of the flow, and the Lipschitz continuity of the flow map and the time-reversed flow map for several rich classes of target distributions. This analysis also sheds light on the auto-encoding and cycle-consistency properties of Gaussian interpolation flows. Additionally, we delve into the stability of these flows in source distributions and perturbations of the velocity field, using the quadratic Wasserstein distance as a metric. Our findings offer valuable insights into the learning techniques employed in Gaussian interpolation flows for generative modeling, providing a solid theoretical foundation for end-to-end error analyses of learning GIFs with empirical observations",

Specifically, 1) to tackle the class imbalance issue, we introduce a dynamic class-wise selection mechanism, leveraging the clustering technique to identify clean nodes based on the neighbor-aggregated confidences. In this way, our approach can avoid the pitfalls of biased sampling which is common with global threshold techniques. 2) To alleviate the problem of noisy labels, built on the concept of the memorization effect, CSGNN prioritizes learning from clean nodes before noisy ones, thereby iteratively enhancing model performance while mitigating label noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CSGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and robustness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed in clinical practice, performance monitoring is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the algorithm over time. The goal of this work is to highlight the complexity of designing a monitoring strategy and the need for a systematic framework that compares the multitude of monitoring options. One of the main decisions is choosing between using real-world (observational) versus interventional data. Although the former is the most convenient source of monitoring data, it exhibits well-known biases, such as confounding, selection, and missingness. In fact, when the ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm itself may be a primary source of bias. On the other hand, a carefully designed interventional study that randomizes individuals can explicitly eliminate such biases, but the ethics, feasibility, and cost of such an approach must be carefully considered. Beyond the decision of the data source, monitoring strategies vary in the performance criteria they track, the interpretability of the test statistics, the strength of their assumptions, and their speed at detecting performance decay. As a first step towards developing a framework that compares the various monitoring options, we consider a case study of an ML-based risk prediction algorithm for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Bringing together tools from causal inference and statistical process control, we walk through the basic steps of defining candidate monitoring criteria, describing potential sources of bias and the causal model, and specifying and comparing candidate monitoring procedures. We hypothesize that these steps can be applied more generally, as causal inference can address other sources of biases as well",

Numerous variants of the problem along with their integration into business solutions have been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. However, the nuanced complexities of in-store planning and a lack of optimization proficiency among store planners with strong domain expertise remain largely overlooked. These challenges frequently necessitate collaborative efforts with multiple stakeholders which often lead to prolonged decision-making processes and significant delays. To mitigate these challenges and capitalize on the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an interactive assortment planning framework, InteraSSort that augments LLMs with optimization tools to assist store planners in making decisions through interactive conversations. Specifically, we develop a solution featuring a user-friendly interface that enables users to express their optimization objectives as input text prompts to InteraSSort and receive tailored optimized solutions as output. Our framework extends beyond basic functionality by enabling the inclusion of additional constraints through interactive conversation, facilitating precise and highly customized decision-making.

These systems adopt languages, often shared under the collective name of Datalog$+/-$, that extend Datalog with the essential feature of existential quantification, while introducing syntactic limitations to sustain reasoning decidability and achieve a good trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. From an implementation perspective, modern reasoners borrow the vast experience of the database community in developing streaming-based data processing systems, such as volcano-iterator architectures, that sustain a limited memory footprint and good scalability. In this paper, we focus on two extremely promising, expressive, and tractable languages, namely, Shy and Warded Datalog$+/-$. We leverage their theoretical underpinnings to introduce novel reasoning techniques, technically, \"chase variants\", that are particularly fit for efficient reasoning in streaming-based architectures.

The considered scenario involves an ISAC device with a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) and a mobile edge computing (MEC) server with a large DNN. After collecting sensing data, the ISAC device either processes the data locally or uploads them to the server for higher-accuracy data processing. To cope with data drifts, the server updates the lightweight DNN when necessary, referred to as continual learning. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average computation cost of the MEC server by optimizing two decisions, i.e., sensing data offloading and sensing data selection for the DNN update. A DT of the ISAC device is constructed to predict the impact of potential decisions on the long-term computation cost of the server, based on which the decisions are made with closed-form formulas. Experiments on executing DNN-based human motion recognition tasks are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed DT-based approach in computation cost minimization",

It is, therefore, understandable that the literature of the last few decades focuses on measuring how much people trust robots -- and more generally, any agent - to foster such trust in these technologies. Researchers have been exploring how people trust robot in different ways, such as measuring trust on human-robot interactions (HRI) based on textual descriptions or images without any physical contact, during and after interacting with the technology. Nevertheless, trust is a complex behaviour, and it is affected and depends on several factors, including those related to the interacting agents (e.g. humans, robots, pets), itself (e.g. capabilities, reliability), the context (e.g. task), and the environment (e.g. public spaces vs private spaces vs working spaces). In general, most roboticists agree that insufficient levels of trust lead to a risk of disengagement while over-trust in technology can cause over-reliance and inherit dangers, for example, in emergency situations. It is, therefore, very important that the research community has access to reliable methods to measure people's trust in robots and technology.

We ensure that the questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the questions are \"Google-proof\"). The questions are also difficult for state-of-the-art AI systems, with our strongest GPT-4 based baseline achieving 39% accuracy. If we are to use future AI systems to help us answer very hard questions, for example, when developing new scientific knowledge, we need to develop scalable oversight methods that enable humans to supervise their outputs, which may be difficult even if the supervisors are themselves skilled and knowledgeable. The difficulty of GPQA both for skilled non-experts and frontier AI systems should enable realistic scalable oversight experiments, which we hope can help devise ways for human experts to reliably get truthful information from AI systems that surpass human capabilities",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dogs have a unique evolutionary relationship with humans and serve many important roles e.g. search and rescue, blind assistance, emotional support. However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment. This work takes a step towards understanding visual behavior of dogs and their interaction with the physical world",

    "abstract": "FinanceBench is a first-of-its-kind test suite for evaluating the performance of LLMs on open book financial question answering (QA). It comprises 10,231 questions about publicly traded companies, with corresponding answers and evidence strings. The questions in FinanceBench are ecologically valid and cover a diverse set of scenarios. They are intended to be clear-cut and straightforward to answer to serve as a minimum performance standard. We test 16 state of the art model configurations (including GPT-4-Turbo, Llama2 and Claude2, with vector stores and long context prompts) on a sample of 150 cases from FinanceBench, and manually review their answers (n=2,400). The cases are available open-source. We show that existing LLMs have clear limitations for financial QA. Notably, GPT-4-Turbo used with a retrieval system incorrectly answered or refused to answer 81% of questions. While augmentation techniques such as using longer context window to feed in relevant evidence improve performance, they are unrealistic for enterprise settings due to increased latency and cannot support larger financial documents. We find that all models examined exhibit weaknesses, such as hallucinations, that limit their suitability for use by enterprises",

    "abstract": "In previous works, a mobile application was developed using an unmodified commercial off-the-shelf smartphone to recognize whole-body exercises. The working principle was based on the ultrasound Doppler sensing with the device built-in hardware. Applying such a lab-environment trained model on realistic application variations causes a significant drop in performance, and thus decimate its applicability. The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data. To study and overcome this issue, this paper presents a database with controlled and uncontrolled subsets of fitness exercises. We propose two concepts to utilize small adaption data to successfully improve model generalization in an uncontrolled environment, increasing the recognition accuracy by two to six folds compared to the baseline for different users",

We plan to situate this system in a refinement-based approach, where a user writes a constraint specification describing a problem above the level of abstraction at which many modelling decisions are made.

    "title": "Analyzing Emissions and Energy Efficiency in Mixed Traffic Control at Unsignalized Intersections",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically risen since the early 1900s with U.S. transportation generating 28% of the U.S' emissions. As such, there is interest in reducing transportation-related emissions. Specifically, sustainability research has sprouted around signalized intersections as intersections allow different streams of traffic to cross and change directions. Recent research has developed mixed traffic control eco-driving strategies at signalized intersections to decrease emissions. However, the inherent structure of a signalized intersection generates increased emissions by creating frequent acceleration/deceleration events, excessive idling from traffic congestion, and stop-and-go waves. Thus, we believe unsignalized intersections hold potential for further sustainability improvements. In this work, we provide an emissions analysis on unsignalized intersections with complex, real-world topologies and traffic demands where mixed traffic control strategies are employed by robot vehicles (RVs) to reduce waiting times and congestion. We find with at least 10% RV penetration rate, RVs generate less fuel consumption and NOx emissions than signalized intersections by up to 27% and 28%, respectively. With at least 30% RVs, CO and HC emissions are reduced by up to 42% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, RVs can reduce emissions across the whole network despite only employing their strategies at the intersections",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly pre-trained language models (PLMs), have been revealed to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial examples generated by many mainstream word-level adversarial attack models are neither valid nor natural, leading to the loss of semantic maintenance, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility. Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin. The model can generate adversarial examples that are typically valid and natural, with the preservation of semantic meaning, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility",

    "abstract": "The customization of recommended content to users holds significant importance in enhancing user experiences across a wide spectrum of applications such as e-commerce, music, and shopping. Graph-based methods have achieved considerable performance by capturing user-item interactions. However, these methods tend to utilize randomly constructed embeddings in the dataset used for training the recommender, which lacks any user preferences. Here, we propose the concept of variational embeddings as a means of pre-training the recommender system to improve the feature propagation through the layers of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The graph variational embedding collaborative filtering (GVECF) is introduced as a novel framework to incorporate representations learned through a variational graph auto-encoder which are embedded into a GCN-based collaborative filtering. This approach effectively transforms latent high-order user-item interactions into more trainable vectors, ultimately resulting in better performance in terms of recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain(NDCG) metrics. The experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 13.78% improvement in the recall over the test data",

The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks.

Despite this, routing algorithms and applications are usually developed for a general purpose, meaning that certain groups, such as ageing people, are often marginalized due to the broad approach of the designed algorithms. This situation may pose a problem in cities which are suffering a slow but progressive ageing of their populations. With this motivation in mind, this paper focuses on describing our implemented Age-Friendly Route Planner, whose goal is to improve the experience in the city for senior citizens. In order to measure the age-friendliness of a route, several variables have been deemed, such as the number of amenities along the route, the amount of comfortable elements found, or the avoidance of sloppy sections. In this paper, we describe one of the main features of the Age-Friendly Route Planner: the preference-based routes, and we also demonstrate how it can contribute to the creation of adapted friendly routes",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost (1.19 GFLOPS).

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Dynamic handwriting analysis, due to its non-invasive and readily accessible nature, has recently emerged as a vital adjunctive method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we design a compact and efficient network architecture to analyse the distinctive handwriting patterns of patients' dynamic handwriting signals, thereby providing an objective identification for the Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Methods: The proposed network is based on a hybrid deep learning approach that fully leverages the advantages of both long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the LSTM block is adopted to extract the time-varying features, while the CNN-based block is implemented using one-dimensional convolution for low computational cost. Moreover, the hybrid model architecture is continuously refined under ablation studies for superior performance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method with its generalization under a five-fold cross-validation, which validates its efficiency and robustness. Results: The proposed network demonstrates its versatility by achieving impressive classification accuracies on both our new DraWritePD dataset ($96.2\\%$) and the well-established PaHaW dataset ($90.7\\%$). Moreover, the network architecture also stands out for its excellent lightweight design, occupying a mere $0.084$M of parameters, with a total of only $0.59$M floating-point operations. It also exhibits near real-time CPU inference performance, with inference times ranging from $0.106$ to $0.220$s. Conclusions: We present a series of experiments with extensive analysis, which systematically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid neural network in extracting distinctive handwriting patterns for precise diagnosis of Parkinson's disease",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In autonomous driving perception systems, 3D detection and tracking are the two fundamental tasks. This paper delves deeper into this field, building upon the Sparse4D framework. We introduce two auxiliary training tasks (Temporal Instance Denoising and Quality Estimation) and propose decoupled attention to make structural improvements, leading to significant enhancements in detection performance. Additionally, we extend the detector into a tracker using a straightforward approach that assigns instance ID during inference, further highlighting the advantages of query-based algorithms. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark validate the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. With ResNet50 as the backbone, we witnessed enhancements of 3.0\\%, 2.2\\%, and 7.6\\% in mAP, NDS, and AMOTA, achieving 46.9\\%, 56.1\\%, and 49.0\\%, respectively. Our best model achieved 71.9\\% NDS and 67.7\\% AMOTA on the nuScenes test set. Code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/linxuewu/Sparse4D}",

    "title": "Towards Robust Text Retrieval with Progressive Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Retrieval augmentation has become an effective solution to empower large language models (LLMs) with external and verified knowledge sources from the database, which overcomes the limitations and hallucinations of LLMs in handling up-to-date and domain-specific information. However, existing embedding models for text retrieval usually have three non-negligible limitations. First, the number and diversity of samples in a batch are too restricted to supervise the modeling of textual nuances at scale. Second, the high proportional noise are detrimental to the semantic correctness and consistency of embeddings. Third, the equal treatment to easy and difficult samples would cause sub-optimum convergence of embeddings with poorer generalization. In this paper, we propose the PEG, a progressively learned embeddings for robust text retrieval. Specifically, we increase the training in-batch negative samples to 80,000, and for each query, we extracted five hard negatives. Concurrently, we incorporated a progressive learning mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically modulate its attention to the samples throughout the entire training process. Additionally, PEG is trained on more than 100 million data, encompassing a wide range of domains (e.g., finance, medicine, and tourism) and covering various tasks (e.g., question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and similarity matching). Extensive experiments conducted on C-MTEB and DuReader demonstrate that PEG surpasses state-of-the-art embeddings in retrieving true positives, highlighting its significant potential for applications in LLMs. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/TownsWu/PEG",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows outstanding capability in code formatting, while unnecessary behaviors such as deleting or translating comments are also observed",

    "title": "Causal Structure Learning Supervised by Large Language Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is pivotal for deciphering complex relationships. Causal Structure Learning (CSL), which focuses on deriving causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from data, faces challenges due to vast DAG spaces and data sparsity. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), recognized for their causal reasoning capabilities, offers a promising direction to enhance CSL by infusing it with knowledge-based causal inferences. However, existing approaches utilizing LLMs for CSL have encountered issues, including unreliable constraints from imperfect LLM inferences and the computational intensity of full pairwise variable analyses. In response, we introduce the Iterative LLM Supervised CSL (ILS-CSL) framework. ILS-CSL innovatively integrates LLM-based causal inference with CSL in an iterative process, refining the causal DAG using feedback from LLMs. This method not only utilizes LLM resources more efficiently but also generates more robust and high-quality structural constraints compared to previous methodologies. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight real-world datasets demonstrates ILS-CSL's superior performance, setting a new standard in CSL efficacy and showcasing its potential to significantly advance the field of causal discovery.

Existing methods mainly process video data where the time dimension mingles with the space and channel dimensions from three distinct angles: as a sequence of individual frames, as a 3D volume in spatiotemporal coordinates, or as a stacked image where frames are treated as separate channels. Most of them generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three levels: frames, channels, and locations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art prediction performance on three benchmark video datasets covering both synthetic and real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods",

    "abstract": "The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge. However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering news timeline generation practical for professional use.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The application of LLMs to specific domains, such as biomedicine, has achieved increased attention. However, most biomedical LLMs focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation tasks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the LLMs on diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, we present Taiyi, a bilingual (English and Chinese) fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. In this work, we first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text mining datasets across over 10 task types. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification, question answering tasks demonstrate Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyi's considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking.

    "abstract": "Embedded devices are specialised devices designed for one or only a few purposes. They are often part of a larger system, through wired or wireless connection. Those embedded devices that are connected to other computers or embedded systems through the Internet are called Internet of Things (IoT for short) devices. With their widespread usage and their insufficient protection, these devices are increasingly becoming the target of malware attacks. Companies often cut corners to save manufacturing costs or misconfigure when producing these devices. This can be lack of software updates, ports left open or security defects by design. Although these devices may not be as powerful as a regular computer, their large number makes them suitable candidates for botnets. Other types of IoT devices can even cause health problems since there are even pacemakers connected to the Internet. This means, that without sufficient defence, even directed assaults are possible against people. The goal of this thesis project is to provide better security for these devices with the help of machine learning algorithms and reverse engineering tools. Specifically, I study the applicability of control-flow related data of executables for malware detection. I present a malware detection method with two phases. The first phase extracts control-flow related data using static binary analysis. The second phase classifies binary executables as either malicious or benign using a neural network model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO.

The question arises as to how these models compare to traditional classification methods, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Principal ideas/results: Based on five diverse datasets, our results show that ChatGPT consistently outperforms LSTM, and while ChatGPT is more effective than SVM in classifying functional requirements (FR), SVM is better in classifying non-functional requirements (NFR). Our results also show that contrary to our expectations, the few-shot setting does not always lead to enhanced performance; in most instances, it was found to be suboptimal.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Our focus is on projects, i.e., business processes, which are emerging as the economic drivers of our times. Differently from day-to-day operational processes that do not require detailed planning, a project requires planning and resource-constrained scheduling for coordinating resources across sub- or related projects and organizations. A planner in charge of project planning has to select a set of activities to perform, determine their precedence constraints, and schedule them according to temporal project constraints. We suggest a data-driven project planning approach for classes of projects such as infrastructure building and information systems development projects. A project network is first learned from historical records. The discovered network relaxes temporal constraints embedded in individual projects, thus uncovering where planning and scheduling flexibility can be exploited for greater benefit. Then, the network, which contains multiple project plan variations, from which one has to be selected, is enriched by identifying decision rules and frequent paths. The planner can rely on the project network for: 1) decoding a project variation such that it forms a new project plan, and 2) applying resource-constrained project scheduling procedures to determine the project's schedule and resource allocation. Using two real-world project datasets, we show that the suggested approach may provide the planner with significant flexibility (up to a 26% reduction of the critical path of a real project) to adjust the project plan and schedule. We believe that the proposed approach can play an important part in supporting decision making towards automated data-driven project planning",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for managing structured data and enhancing data science processes. Despite the potential benefits, this integration poses significant questions regarding their reliability and decision-making methodologies. It highlights the importance of various factors in the model selection process, including the nature of the data, problem type, performance metrics, computational resources, interpretability vs accuracy, assumptions about data, and ethical considerations. Our objective is to elucidate and express the factors and assumptions guiding GPT-4's model selection recommendations. We employ a variability model to depict these factors and use toy datasets to evaluate both the model and the implementation of the identified heuristics. By contrasting these outcomes with heuristics from other platforms, our aim is to determine the effectiveness and distinctiveness of GPT-4's methodology. This research is committed to advancing our comprehension of AI decision-making processes, especially in the realm of model selection within data science. Our efforts are directed towards creating AI systems that are more transparent and comprehensible, contributing to a more responsible and efficient practice in data science",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Meta Prompting, a novel technique that revolutionizes the way large language models (LLMs), multi-modal foundation models, and AI systems approach problem-solving and data interpretation. Meta Prompting, rooted in type theory and category theory, prioritizes the structure and syntax of information, providing a unique framework that transcends traditional content-focused methods. We delve into the formal definitions of Meta Prompting, contrasting it with Few-Shot Prompting, and highlight its applicability and superiority in various AI applications. Key to this exploration is the expansion of Meta Prompting into the realm of complex reasoning. Here, we demonstrate how this technique adeptly breaks down intricate problems into manageable sub-problems, facilitating a step-by-step, detailed approach to problem-solving. This method proves especially advantageous in terms of token efficiency and offering a fair comparison in problem-solving scenarios, standing out against few-shot example approaches. Furthermore, the paper breaks new ground by extending Meta Prompting into multi-modal foundation model settings. This extension addresses the integration of diverse data types, such as images, audio, and video, within the structured framework of Meta Prompting, highlighting both the challenges and the vast potential of this approach in handling complex, multi-faceted data (The code is available at https://github.com/meta-prompting/meta-prompting)",

We then use these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We demonstrate our method on the \\tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10\\% of the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L, whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L.

To delve into the adaptability evaluation on pre-trained models for CAN intrusion detection, we have developed two distinct models: CAN-SecureBERT and CAN-LLAMA2. Notably, our CAN-LLAMA2 model surpasses the state-of-the-art models by achieving an exceptional performance 0.999993 in terms of balanced accuracy, precision detection rate, F1 score, and a remarkably low false alarm rate of 3.10e-6. Impressively, the false alarm rate is 52 times smaller than that of the leading model, MTH-IDS (Multitiered Hybrid Intrusion Detection System).

    "abstract": "Space weather phenomena like geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) pose significant risks to critical technological infrastructure. While traditional predictive models, grounded in simulation, hold theoretical robustness, they grapple with challenges, notably the assimilation of imprecise data and extensive computational complexities. In recent years, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has been adopted to develop Machine Learning (ML)-enabled magnetometer systems for predicting real-time terrestrial magnetic perturbations as a proxy measure for GIC. While TinyML offers efficient, real-time data processing, its intrinsic limitations prevent the utilization of robust methods with high computational needs. This paper developed a physics-guided TinyML framework to address the above challenges. This framework integrates physics-based regularization at the stages of model training and compression, thereby augmenting the reliability of predictions. The developed pruning scheme within the framework harnesses the inherent physical characteristics of the domain, striking a balance between model size and robustness. The study presents empirical results, drawing a comprehensive comparison between the accuracy and reliability of the developed framework and its traditional counterpart. Such a comparative analysis underscores the prospective applicability of the developed framework in conceptualizing robust, ML-enabled magnetometer systems for real-time space weather forecasting",

Most of these measures fall into one of two categories.

Second, measures such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel alignment (CKA), and normalized Bures similarity (NBS) all quantify similarity in summary statistics, such as stimulus-by-stimulus kernel matrices, which are already invariant to expected symmetries. Here, we take steps towards unifying these two broad categories of methods by observing that the cosine of the Riemannian shape distance (from category 1) is equal to NBS (from category 2). We explore how this connection leads to new interpretations of shape distances and NBS, and draw contrasts of these measures with CKA, a popular similarity measure in the deep learning literature",

With Smaragdine, the energy consumption of a DL program can be broken down into units aligned with its logical hierarchical decomposition structure. We apply Smaragdine for understanding the energy behavior of BERT, one of the most widely used language models. Layer-by-layer and tensor-by-tensor, Smaragdine is capable of identifying the highest energy/power-consuming components of BERT.

In this work, we first investigate the use of \\emph{offline} RL algorithms in solving the RRM problem. We evaluate several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, including behavior constrained Q-learning (BCQ), conservative Q-learning (CQL), and implicit Q-learning (IQL), for a specific RRM problem that aims at maximizing a linear combination {of sum and} 5-percentile rates via user scheduling. We observe that the performance of offline RL for the RRM problem depends critically on the behavior policy used for data collection, and further propose a novel offline RL solution that leverages heterogeneous datasets collected by different behavior policies. We show that with a proper mixture of the datasets, offline RL can produce a near-optimal RL policy even when all involved behavior policies are highly suboptimal",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There exist a wide range of single number metrics for assessing performance of classification algorithms, including AUC and the F1-score (Wikipedia lists 17 such metrics, with 27 different names). In this article, I propose a new metric to answer the following question: when an algorithm is tuned so that it can no longer distinguish labelled cats from real cats, how often does a randomly chosen image that has been labelled as containing a cat actually contain a cat? The steps to construct this metric are as follows. First, we set a threshold score such that when the algorithm is shown two randomly-chosen images -- one that has a score greater than the threshold (i.e. a picture labelled as containing a cat) and another from those pictures that really does contain a cat -- the probability that the image with the highest score is the one chosen from the set of real cat images is 50\\%. At this decision threshold, the set of positively labelled images are indistinguishable from the set of images which are positive. Then, as a second step, we measure performance by asking how often a randomly chosen picture from those labelled as containing a cat actually contains a cat. This metric can be thought of as {\\it precision at the indistinguishability threshold}. While this new metric doesn't address the tradeoff between precision and recall inherent to all such metrics, I do show why this method avoids pitfalls that can occur when using, for example AUC, and it is better motivated than, for example, the F1-score",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

Recent application of deep learning methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined. Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical priors.

We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a general time-series model from multiple heterogeneous time-series dataset: providing semantically useful inputs to models for modeling time series of different dynamics from different domains. We observe that partitioning time-series into segments as inputs to sequential models produces semantically better inputs and propose a novel model LPTM that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy leveraging self-supervised learning loss during pre-training. LPTM provides performance similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model and is significantly more data and compute efficient taking up to 40% less data as well as 50% less training time to achieve state-of-art performance in a wide range of time-series analysis tasks from multiple disparate domain",

    "abstract": "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is trained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training samples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive rules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise, and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to explore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the community to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related challenges in other research fields such as continual learning.

Here we provide a solution to this dilemma, by algorithmically reinterpreting the ALIF model, reducing the sequential simulation complexity and permitting a more efficient parallelisation on GPUs. We computationally validate our implementation to obtain over a $50\\times$ training speedup using small DTs on synthetic benchmarks. We also obtained a comparable performance to the standard ALIF implementation on different supervised classification tasks - yet in a fraction of the training time.

    "abstract": "Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (MTRL) tackles the long-standing problem of endowing agents with skills that generalize across a variety of problems. To this end, sharing representations plays a fundamental role in capturing both unique and common characteristics of the tasks. Tasks may exhibit similarities in terms of skills, objects, or physical properties while leveraging their representations eases the achievement of a universal policy. Nevertheless, the pursuit of learning a shared set of diverse representations is still an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for representation learning in MTRL that encapsulates common structures among the tasks using orthogonal representations to promote diversity. Our method, named Mixture Of Orthogonal Experts (MOORE), leverages a Gram-Schmidt process to shape a shared subspace of representations generated by a mixture of experts. When task-specific information is provided, MOORE generates relevant representations from this shared subspace. We assess the effectiveness of our approach on two MTRL benchmarks, namely MiniGrid and MetaWorld, showing that MOORE surpasses related baselines and establishes a new state-of-the-art result on MetaWorld",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this work, we address the challenging and emergent problem of novel object detection (NOD), focusing on the accurate detection of both known and novel object categories during inference. Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset. Adapting our approach to the COCO OVD split, we surpass the current state-of-the-art by a margin of 7.2 $ \\text{AP}_{50} $ for novel classes.

    "abstract": "Recently, pretraining methods for the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful at learning effective representations from unlabeled graph data. However, most of these methods rely on pairwise relations in the graph and do not capture the underling higher-order relations between entities. Hypergraphs are versatile and expressive structures that can effectively model higher-order relationships among entities in the data. Despite the efforts to adapt GNNs to hypergraphs (HyperGNN), there are currently no fully self-supervised pretraining methods for HyperGNN on heterogeneous hypergraphs. In this paper, we present SPHH, a novel self-supervised pretraining framework for heterogeneous HyperGNNs. Our method is able to effectively capture higher-order relations among entities in the data in a self-supervised manner. SPHH is consist of two self-supervised pretraining tasks that aim to simultaneously learn both local and global representations of the entities in the hypergraph by using informative representations derived from the hypergraph structure. Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of self-supervised pretraining of HyperGNNs, and has the potential to improve the performance of various graph-based downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction tasks which are mapped to hypergraph configuration. Our experiments on two real-world benchmarks using four different HyperGNN models show that our proposed SPHH framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that SPHH is able to improve the performance of various HyperGNN models in various downstream tasks, regardless of their architecture or complexity, which highlights the robustness of our framework",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks has become an active field of research and plays a crucial role in various downstream tasks such as active learning. Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/KerryDRX/EvidentialADA. This alternative means of evidential uncertainty quantification will give researchers more options when class uncertainties and correlations are important in their applications",

Inspired by recent developments in geometric classical and quantum machine learning, here we design quantum neural networks that explicitly incorporate, as a data-inspired prior, an extensive set of physically relevant symmetries. We find that our invariant quantum learning models outperform their more generic counterparts on individual molecules of growing complexity. Furthermore, we study a water dimer as a minimal example of a system with multiple components, showcasing the versatility of our proposed approach and opening the way towards larger simulations. Our results suggest that molecular force fields generation can significantly profit from leveraging the framework of geometric quantum machine learning, and that chemical systems represent, in fact, an interesting and rich playground for the development and application of advanced quantum machine learning tools",

Existing algorithmic recourse approaches often assume an invariant predictive model; however, the predictive model is usually updated upon the arrival of new data. Thus, a recourse that is valid respective to the present model may become invalid for the future model. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations for MPM, including the $\\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting. Furthermore, we show that our surrogate pushes the approximate hyperplane intuitively, facilitating not only robust but also interpretable recourses.

This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design",

To address these shortcomings, we propose the LABCAT algorithm, which extends trust-region-based BO by adding principal-component-aligned rotation and an adaptive rescaling strategy based on the length-scales of a local Gaussian process surrogate model with automatic relevance determination.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation make widespread use of representation learning. Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATEs are non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose to perform partial identification of CATEs or, equivalently, aim at estimating of lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance",

    "abstract": "Time series is a special type of sequence data, a sequence of real-valued random variables collected at even intervals of time. The real-world multivariate time series comes with noises and contains complicated local and global temporal dynamics, making it difficult to forecast the future time series given the historical observations. This work proposes a simple and effective framework, coined as TimeSQL, which leverages multi-scale patching and smooth quadratic loss (SQL) to tackle the above challenges. The multi-scale patching transforms the time series into two-dimensional patches with different length scales, facilitating the perception of both locality and long-term correlations in time series. SQL is derived from the rational quadratic kernel and can dynamically adjust the gradients to avoid overfitting to the noises and outliers. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild conditions, the effect of the noises on the model with SQL is always smaller than that with MSE. Based on the two modules, TimeSQL achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the eight real-world benchmark datasets. Further ablation studies indicate that the key modules in TimeSQL could also enhance the results of other models for multivariate time series forecasting, standing as plug-and-play techniques",

The interplay between RRA and vehicle control necessitates their collaborative design. In this two-part paper (Part I and Part II), taking platoon control (PC) as an example use case, we propose a joint optimization framework of multi-timescale control and communications (MTCC) based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this paper (Part I), we first decompose the problem into a communication-aware DRL-based PC sub-problem and a control-aware DRL-based RRA sub-problem. Then, we focus on the PC sub-problem assuming an RRA policy is given, and propose the MTCC-PC algorithm to learn an efficient PC policy. To improve the PC performance under random observation delay, the PC state space is augmented with the observation delay and PC action history. Moreover, the reward function with respect to the augmented state is defined to construct an augmented state Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is proved that the optimal policy for the augmented state MDP is optimal for the original PC problem with observation delay. Different from most existing works on communication-aware control, the MTCC-PC algorithm is trained in a delayed environment generated by the fine-grained embedded simulation of C-V2X communications rather than by a simple stochastic delay model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) becomes increasingly critical as neural networks (NNs) are being widely adopted in addressing complex problems across various scientific disciplines. Representative SciML models are physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). While UQ in SciML has been increasingly investigated in recent years, very few works have focused on addressing the uncertainty caused by the noisy inputs, such as spatial-temporal coordinates in PINNs and input functions in NOs. The presence of noise in the inputs of the models can pose significantly more challenges compared to noise in the outputs of the models, primarily due to the inherent nonlinearity of most SciML algorithms. As a result, UQ for noisy inputs becomes a crucial factor for reliable and trustworthy deployment of these models in applications involving physical knowledge. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty arising from noisy inputs-outputs in PINNs and NOs. We show that this approach can be seamlessly integrated into PINNs and NOs, when they are employed to encode the physical information. PINNs incorporate physics by including physics-informed terms via automatic differentiation, either in the loss function or the likelihood, and often take as input the spatial-temporal coordinate. Therefore, the present method equips PINNs with the capability to address problems where the observed coordinate is subject to noise. On the other hand, pretrained NOs are also commonly employed as equation-free surrogates in solving differential equations and Bayesian inverse problems, in which they take functions as inputs. The proposed approach enables them to handle noisy measurements for both input and output functions with UQ",

    "title": "BOIS: Bayesian Optimization of Interconnected Systems",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the global optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. One of the main advantages of BO is its use of Gaussian processes (GPs) to characterize model uncertainty which can be leveraged to guide the learning and search process. However, BO typically treats systems as black-boxes and this limits the ability to exploit structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections). Composite functions of the form $f(x, y(x))$, wherein GP modeling is shifted from the performance function $f$ to an intermediate function $y$, offer an avenue for exploiting structural knowledge. However, the use of composite functions in a BO framework is complicated by the need to generate a probability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y$ calculated by the GP (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression). Previous work has handled this issue using sampling techniques; these are easy to implement and flexible but are computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm which allows for the efficient use of composite functions in BO; this uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain closed-form expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that this simple approach (which we call BOIS) enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. Using a chemical process optimization case study, we benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and sampling approaches. Our results indicate that BOIS achieves performance gains and accurately captures the statistics of composite functions",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has shown promising performance in submeter-level mapping tasks; however, the annotation cost of submeter-level imagery remains a challenge, especially when applied on a large scale. In this paper, we present the first submeter-level land cover mapping of Japan with eight classes, at a relatively low annotation cost. We introduce a human-in-the-loop deep learning framework leveraging OpenEarthMap, a recently introduced benchmark dataset for global submeter-level land cover mapping, with a U-Net model that achieves national-scale mapping with a small amount of additional labeled data. By adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall accuracy of 80\\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of eight classes for the entire country of Japan. Our framework, with its low annotation cost and high-accuracy mapping results, demonstrates the potential to contribute to the automatic updating of national-scale land cover mapping using submeter-level optical remote sensing data. The mapping results will be made publicly available",

    "title": "Open Set Dandelion Network for IoT Intrusion Detection",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As IoT devices become widely, it is crucial to protect them from malicious intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To address this, in this paper we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner. The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion. Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge, a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9%",

    "title": "Unraveling the `Anomaly' in Time Series Anomaly Detection: A Self-supervised Tri-domain Solution",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The ongoing challenges in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), notably the scarcity of anomaly labels and the variability in anomaly lengths and shapes, have led to the need for a more efficient solution. As limited anomaly labels hinder traditional supervised models in TSAD, various SOTA deep learning techniques, such as self-supervised learning, have been introduced to tackle this issue. However, they encounter difficulties handling variations in anomaly lengths and shapes, limiting their adaptability to diverse anomalies. Additionally, many benchmark datasets suffer from the problem of having explicit anomalies that even random functions can detect. This problem is exacerbated by ill-posed evaluation metrics, known as point adjustment (PA), which can result in inflated model performance. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based Tri-domain Anomaly Detector (TriAD), which addresses these challenges by modeling features across three data domains - temporal, frequency, and residual domains - without relying on anomaly labels. Unlike traditional contrastive learning methods, TriAD employs both inter-domain and intra-domain contrastive loss to learn common attributes among normal data and differentiate them from anomalies. Additionally, our approach can detect anomalies of varying lengths by integrating with a discord discovery algorithm. It is worth noting that this study is the first to reevaluate the deep learning potential in TSAD, utilizing both rigorously designed datasets (i.e., UCR Archive) and evaluation metrics (i.e., PA%K and affiliation). Through experimental results on the UCR dataset, TriAD achieves an impressive three-fold increase in PA%K based F1 scores over SOTA deep learning models, and 50% increase of accuracy as compared to SOTA discord discovery algorithms",

    "abstract": "Molecular sciences address a wide range of problems involving molecules of different types and sizes and their complexes. Recently, geometric deep learning, especially Graph Neural Networks, has shown promising performance in molecular science applications. However, most existing works often impose targeted inductive biases to a specific molecular system, and are inefficient when applied to macromolecules or large-scale tasks, thereby limiting their applications to many real-world problems. To address these challenges, we present PAMNet, a universal framework for accurately and efficiently learning the representations of three-dimensional (3D) molecules of varying sizes and types in any molecular system. Inspired by molecular mechanics, PAMNet induces a physics-informed bias to explicitly model local and non-local interactions and their combined effects. As a result, PAMNet can reduce expensive operations, making it time and memory efficient. In extensive benchmark studies, PAMNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines regarding both accuracy and efficiency in three diverse learning tasks: small molecule properties, RNA 3D structures, and protein-ligand binding affinities. Our results highlight the potential for PAMNet in a broad range of molecular science applications",

    "title": "FedRA: A Random Allocation Strategy for Federated Tuning to Unleash the Power of Heterogeneous Clients",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of Foundation Models, federated tuning has garnered attention in the field of federated learning, utilizing data and computation resources from multiple clients to collaboratively fine-tune foundation models. However, in real-world federated scenarios, there often exist a multitude of heterogeneous clients with varying computation and communication resources, rendering them incapable of supporting the entire model fine-tuning process. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel federated tuning algorithm, FedRA. The implementation of FedRA is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated into any transformer-based model without the need for further modification to the original model. Specifically, in each communication round, FedRA randomly generates an allocation matrix. For resource-constrained clients, it reorganizes a small number of layers from the original model based on the allocation matrix and fine-tunes using LoRA. Subsequently, the server aggregates the updated LoRA parameters from the clients according to the current allocation matrix into the corresponding layers of the original model. It is worth noting that FedRA also supports scenarios where none of the clients can support the entire global model, which is an impressive advantage. We conduct experiments on two large-scale image datasets, DomainNet and NICO++, under various non-iid settings. The results demonstrate that FedRA outperforms the compared methods significantly.

    "title": "TextGuard: Provable Defense against Backdoor Attacks on Text Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have become a major security threat for deploying machine learning models in security-critical applications. Existing research endeavors have proposed many defenses against backdoor attacks. Despite demonstrating certain empirical defense efficacy, none of these techniques could provide a formal and provable security guarantee against arbitrary attacks. As a result, they can be easily broken by strong adaptive attacks, as shown in our evaluation. In this work, we propose TextGuard, the first provable defense against backdoor attacks on text classification. In particular, TextGuard first divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger. Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the triggers in training and testing inputs. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGuard on three benchmark text classification tasks, surpassing the certification accuracy of existing certified defenses against backdoor attacks. Furthermore, we propose additional strategies to enhance the empirical performance of TextGuard. Comparisons with state-of-the-art empirical defenses validate the superiority of TextGuard in countering multiple backdoor attacks.

    "title": "Can We Utilize Pre-trained Language Models within Causal Discovery Algorithms?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scaling laws have allowed Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) into the field of causal reasoning. Causal reasoning of PLM relies solely on text-based descriptions, in contrast to causal discovery which aims to determine the causal relationships between variables utilizing data. Recently, there has been current research regarding a method that mimics causal discovery by aggregating the outcomes of repetitive causal reasoning, achieved through specifically designed prompts. It highlights the usefulness of PLMs in discovering cause and effect, which is often limited by a lack of data, especially when dealing with multiple variables. Conversely, the characteristics of PLMs which are that PLMs do not analyze data and they are highly dependent on prompt design leads to a crucial limitation for directly using PLMs in causal discovery. Accordingly, PLM-based causal reasoning deeply depends on the prompt design and carries out the risk of overconfidence and false predictions in determining causal relationships. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the aforementioned limitations of PLM-based causal reasoning through experiments on physics-inspired synthetic data. Then, we propose a new framework that integrates prior knowledge obtained from PLM with a causal discovery algorithm. This is accomplished by initializing an adjacency matrix for causal discovery and incorporating regularization using prior knowledge. Our proposed framework not only demonstrates improved performance through the integration of PLM and causal discovery but also suggests how to leverage PLM-extracted prior knowledge with existing causal discovery algorithms",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) framework for network slicing in a dynamic environment with multiple base stations and multiple users. In particular, we propose a novel deep RL framework with multiple actors and centralized critic (MACC) in which actors are implemented as pointer networks to fit the varying dimension of input. We evaluate the performance of the proposed deep RL algorithm via simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we develop a deep RL based jammer with limited prior information and limited power budget. The goal of the jammer is to minimize the transmission rates achieved with network slicing and thus degrade the network slicing agents' performance. We design a jammer with both listening and jamming phases and address jamming location optimization as well as jamming channel optimization via deep RL. We evaluate the jammer at the optimized location, generating interference attacks in the optimized set of channels by switching between the jamming phase and listening phase. We show that the proposed jammer can significantly reduce the victims' performance without direct feedback or prior knowledge on the network slicing policies. Finally, we devise a Nash-equilibrium-supervised policy ensemble mixed strategy profile for network slicing (as a defensive measure) and jamming. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy ensemble algorithm by applying on the network slicing agents and the jammer agent in simulations to show its effectiveness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

    "abstract": "The power-law distribution plays a crucial role in complex networks as well as various applied sciences. Investigating whether the degree distribution of a network follows a power-law distribution is an important concern. The commonly used inferential methods for estimating the model parameters often yield biased estimates, which can lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that a model conforms to a power-law. In this paper, we discuss improved methods that utilize Bayesian inference to obtain accurate estimates and precise credibility intervals. The inferential methods are derived for both continuous and discrete distributions. These methods reveal that objective Bayesian approaches return nearly unbiased estimates for the parameters of both models. Notably, in the continuous case, we identify an explicit posterior distribution. This work enhances the power of goodness-of-fit tests, enabling us to accurately discern whether a network or any other dataset adheres to a power-law distribution. We apply the proposed approach to fit degree distributions for more than 5,000 synthetic networks and over 3,000 real networks.

    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

Suppose the goal is to learn or test a property of the average distribution, $\\textbf{p}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.

We develop mathematical programming models that define explicitly both types of auctions, and show that in each type, there are significant benefits to be gained both on the side of the hotelier as well as on the side of the customer.

To address the limitations of existing methods trained on structured traffic datasets, we train our model on unstructured datasets including the Indian Driving Dataset and Bengaluru Driving Dataset. Our semi-supervised training pipeline allows SOccDPT to learn from datasets with limited labels by reducing the requirement for manual labelling by substituting it with pseudo-ground truth labels to produce our Bengaluru Semantic Occupancy Dataset. This broader training enhances our model's ability to handle unstructured traffic scenarios effectively. To overcome memory limitations during training, we introduce patch-wise training where we select a subset of parameters to train each epoch, reducing memory usage during auto-grad graph construction. In the context of unstructured traffic and memory-constrained training and inference, SOccDPT outperforms existing disparity estimation approaches as shown by the RMSE score of 9.1473, achieves a semantic segmentation IoU score of 46.02% and operates at a competitive frequency of 69.47 Hz.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown impressive performance when applied to natural image segmentation. However, it struggles with geographical images like aerial and satellite imagery, especially when segmenting mobility infrastructure including roads, sidewalks, and crosswalks. This inferior performance stems from the narrow features of these objects, their textures blending into the surroundings, and interference from objects like trees, buildings, vehicles, and pedestrians - all of which can disorient the model to produce inaccurate segmentation maps. To address these challenges, we propose Geographical SAM (GeoSAM), a novel SAM-based framework that implements a fine-tuning strategy using the dense visual prompt from zero-shot learning, and the sparse visual prompt from a pre-trained CNN segmentation model. The proposed GeoSAM outperforms existing approaches for geographical image segmentation, specifically by 20%, 14.29%, and 17.65% for road infrastructure, pedestrian infrastructure, and on average, respectively, representing a momentous leap in leveraging foundation models to segment mobility infrastructure including both road and pedestrian infrastructure in geographical images",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in addressing tasks that necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools that require a blend of task planning and the utilization of external tools, such as APIs. However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them. In response, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents operating within real-world systems. Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further used for in-context learning to boost the final performance. We validate our methods using a real-world commercial system as well as an open-sourced academic dataset, and the outcomes clearly showcase the efficacy of each individual component as well as the integrated framework",

    "title": "Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Manipulation Skill Acquisition",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Robotic manipulation holds the potential to replace humans in the execution of tedious or dangerous tasks. However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline. Furthermore, we conduct physical experiments on a gripper screwing task using our method, which showcases the algorithm's rapid learning capability and its potential for practical applications",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of multimodal learning, pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable capacities in bridging the gap between visual and language modalities. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly in the image modality, presenting considerable security risks. This paper introduces Adversarial Prompt Tuning (AdvPT), a novel technique to enhance the adversarial robustness of image encoders in VLMs. AdvPT innovatively leverages learnable text prompts and aligns them with adversarial image embeddings, to address the vulnerabilities inherent in VLMs without the need for extensive parameter training or modification of the model architecture. We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper",

    "abstract": "While search is the predominant method of accessing information, formulating effective queries remains a challenging task, especially for situations where the users are not familiar with a domain, or searching for documents in other languages, or looking for complex information such as events, which are not easily expressible as queries. Providing example documents or passages of interest, might be easier for a user, however, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and are highly sensitive to the query generation method. This demo illustrates complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting and enabling the user to provide edits and feedback at all stages of the query formulation process. The proposed Query Generation Assistant is a novel search interface which supports automatic and interactive query generation over a mono-linguial or multi-lingual document collection. Specifically, the proposed assistive interface enables the users to refine the queries generated by different LLMs, to provide feedback on the retrieved documents or passages, and is able to incorporate the users' feedback as prompts to generate more effective queries. The proposed interface is a valuable experimental tool for exploring fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs for query generation to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval and ranking models, and for conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries without such assistance",

We introduce Simplified Plaintext Language (SPLAIN), a natural language generator that converts warning data into user-friendly cyber threat explanations. SPLAIN is designed to generate clear, actionable outputs, incorporating hierarchically organized explanatory details about input data and system functionality. Given the inputs of individual sensor-induced forecasting signals and an overall warning from a fusion module, SPLAIN queries each signal for information on contributing sensors and data signals. This collected data is processed into a coherent English explanation, encompassing forecasting, sensing, and data elements for user review. SPLAIN's template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary. SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand. Our conclusions emphasize the need for designers to specify the \"how\" and \"why\" behind cyber warnings, advocate for simple structured templates in generating consistent explanations, and recognize that direct causal links in Machine Learning approaches may not always be identifiable, requiring some explanations to focus on general methodologies, such as model and training data",

    "abstract": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87.

However, to date that has been limited evaluation of existing AIIA instruments. We conduct a classroom study (N = 38) at a large research-intensive university (R1) in an elective course focused on the societal and ethical implications of AI. We assign students to different organizational roles (for example, an ML scientist or product manager) and ask participant teams to complete one of three existing AI impact assessments for one of two imagined generative AI systems. In our thematic analysis of participants' responses to pre- and post-activity questionnaires, we find preliminary evidence that impact assessments can influence participants' perceptions of the potential risks of generative AI systems, and the level of responsibility held by AI experts in addressing potential harm. We also discover a consistent set of limitations shared by several existing AIIA instruments, which we group into concerns about their format and content, as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the activity in foreseeing and mitigating potential harms.
