    "title": "Differentiable and accelerated spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Many areas of science and engineering encounter data defined on spherical manifolds. Modelling and analysis of spherical data often necessitates spherical harmonic transforms, at high degrees, and increasingly requires efficient computation of gradients for machine learning or other differentiable programming tasks. We develop novel algorithmic structures for accelerated and differentiable computation of generalised Fourier transforms on the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ and rotation group $\\text{SO}(3)$, i.e. spherical harmonic and Wigner transforms, respectively. We present a recursive algorithm for the calculation of Wigner $d$-functions that is both stable to high harmonic degrees and extremely parallelisable. By tightly coupling this with separable spherical transforms, we obtain algorithms that exhibit an extremely parallelisable structure that is well-suited for the high throughput computing of modern hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs). We also develop a hybrid automatic and manual differentiation approach so that gradients can be computed efficiently. Our algorithms are implemented within the JAX differentiable programming framework in the S2FFT software code. Numerous samplings of the sphere are supported, including equiangular and HEALPix sampling. Computational errors are at the order of machine precision for spherical samplings that admit a sampling theorem. When benchmarked against alternative C codes we observe up to a 400-fold acceleration. Furthermore, when distributing over multiple GPUs we achieve very close to optimal linear scaling with increasing number of GPUs due to the highly parallelised and balanced nature of our algorithms. Provided access to sufficiently many GPUs our transforms thus exhibit an unprecedented effective linear time complexity",

    "title": "Convergence Analysis for Learning Orthonormal Deep Linear Neural Networks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Enforcing orthonormal or isometric property for the weight matrices has been shown to enhance the training of deep neural networks by mitigating gradient exploding/vanishing and increasing the robustness of the learned networks. However, despite its practical performance, the theoretical analysis of orthonormality in neural networks is still lacking; for example, how orthonormality affects the convergence of the training process. In this letter, we aim to bridge this gap by providing convergence analysis for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks. Specifically, we show that Riemannian gradient descent with an appropriate initialization converges at a linear rate for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks with a class of loss functions. Unlike existing works that enforce orthonormal weight matrices for all the layers, our approach excludes this requirement for one layer, which is crucial to establish the convergence guarantee. Our results shed light on how increasing the number of hidden layers can impact the convergence speed. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning has played a pivotal role in advancing physics, with deep learning notably contributing to solving complex classification problems such as jet tagging in the field of jet physics. In this experiment, we aim to harness the full potential of neural networks while acknowledging that, at times, we may lose sight of the underlying physics governing these models. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that we can achieve remarkable results obscuring physics knowledge and relying completely on the model's outcome. We introduce JetLOV, a composite comprising two models: a straightforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) and the well-established LundNet. Our study reveals that we can attain comparable jet tagging performance without relying on the pre-computed LundNet variables. Instead, we allow the network to autonomously learn an entirely new set of variables, devoid of a priori knowledge of the underlying physics. These findings hold promise, particularly in addressing the issue of model dependence, which can be mitigated through generalization and training on diverse data sets",

We replace this assumption with a weaker one only requiring the shape of the optimisation landscape to be similar, and analyse the recent method Prior Learning for Bayesian Optimisation - PLeBO - in this setting. By learning priors for the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process surrogate model we can better approximate the underlying function, especially for few function evaluations. We validate the learned priors and compare to a breadth of transfer learning approaches, using synthetic data and a recent air pollution optimisation problem as benchmarks.

    "title": "One Pass Streaming Algorithm for Super Long Token Attention Approximation in Sublinear Space",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications that involve long contexts, particularly for extended dialogues and text analysis, is of paramount importance but presents two significant challenges. Firstly, the memory consumption is substantial during the decoding phase due to the caching of Key and Value states (KV) of previous tokens. Secondly, attention computation is time-consuming with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for the generation of each token. In recent OpenAI DevDay (Nov 6, 2023), OpenAI released a new model that is able to support a 128K-long document, in our paper, we focus on the memory-efficient issue when context length $n$ is much greater than 128K ($n \\gg 2^d$). Considering a single-layer self-attention with Query, Key, and Value matrices $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, the polynomial method approximates the attention output $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$ computation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, storing the Key and Value matrices $K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ still necessitates $O( n d)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response to these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of the data in streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to store three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage. Notably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with super-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee diminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant. This unique attribute underscores the potential of our technique in efficiently handling LLMs in streaming applications",

Our experiments show that these problems can be efficiently solved with belief propagation (BP), whose updates are inherently local, presenting exciting opportunities for distributed and asynchronous training. Our approach can be scaled to deep networks and provides a natural means to do continual learning: use the BP-estimated parameter marginals of the current task as parameter priors for the next.

    "title": "More is Better in Modern Machine Learning: when Infinite Overparameterization is Optimal and Overfitting is Obligatory",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In our era of enormous neural networks, empirical progress has been driven by the philosophy that more is better. Recent deep learning practice has found repeatedly that larger model size, more data, and more computation (resulting in lower training loss) improves performance. In this paper, we give theoretical backing to these empirical observations by showing that these three properties hold in random feature (RF) regression, a class of models equivalent to shallow networks with only the last layer trained. Concretely, we first show that the test risk of RF regression decreases monotonically with both the number of features and the number of samples, provided the ridge penalty is tuned optimally. In particular, this implies that infinite width RF architectures are preferable to those of any finite width. We then proceed to demonstrate that, for a large class of tasks characterized by powerlaw eigenstructure, training to near-zero training loss is obligatory: near-optimal performance can only be achieved when the training error is much smaller than the test error. Grounding our theory in real-world data, we find empirically that standard computer vision tasks with convolutional neural tangent kernels clearly fall into this class. Taken together, our results tell a simple, testable story of the benefits of overparameterization, overfitting, and more data in random feature models",

Bayesian optimization is an automatic, general and sample-efficient method to solve these problems with minimal knowledge of the underlying function dynamics. However, the ability of Bayesian optimization to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs about the function at hand in order to accelerate the optimization is limited, which reduces its appeal for knowledgeable practitioners with tight budgets. To allow domain experts to customize the optimization routine, we propose ColaBO, the first Bayesian-principled framework for incorporating prior beliefs beyond the typical kernel structure, such as the likely location of the optimizer or the optimal value. The generality of ColaBO makes it applicable across different Monte Carlo acquisition functions and types of user beliefs. We empirically demonstrate ColaBO's ability to substantially accelerate optimization when the prior information is accurate, and to retain approximately default performance when it is misleading",

    "title": "Differentially Private SGD Without Clipping Bias: An Error-Feedback Approach",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent with gradient clipping (DPSGD-GC) is a powerful tool for training deep learning models using sensitive data, providing both a solid theoretical privacy guarantee and high efficiency. However, using DPSGD-GC to ensure Differential Privacy (DP) comes at the cost of model performance degradation due to DP noise injection and gradient clipping. Existing research has extensively analyzed the theoretical convergence of DPSGD-GC, and has shown that it only converges when using large clipping thresholds that are dependent on problem-specific parameters. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice, making it hard to choose the optimal clipping threshold. Therefore, in practice, DPSGD-GC suffers from degraded performance due to the {\\it constant} bias introduced by the clipping. In our work, we propose a new error-feedback (EF) DP algorithm as an alternative to DPSGD-GC, which not only offers a diminishing utility bound without inducing a constant clipping bias, but more importantly, it allows for an arbitrary choice of clipping threshold that is independent of the problem. We establish an algorithm-specific DP analysis for our proposed algorithm, providing privacy guarantees based on R{\\'e}nyi DP. Additionally, we demonstrate that under mild conditions, our algorithm can achieve nearly the same utility bound as DPSGD without gradient clipping. Our empirical results on Cifar-10/100 and E2E datasets, show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher accuracies than DPSGD while maintaining the same level of DP guarantee",

    "abstract": "Most applications of machine learning to classification assume a closed set of balanced classes. This is at odds with the real world, where class occurrence statistics often follow a long-tailed power-law distribution and it is unlikely that all classes are seen in a single sample. Nonparametric Bayesian models naturally capture this phenomenon, but have significant practical barriers to widespread adoption, namely implementation complexity and computational inefficiency. To address this, we present a method for extracting the inductive bias from a nonparametric Bayesian model and transferring it to an artificial neural network. By simulating data with a nonparametric Bayesian prior, we can metalearn a sequence model that performs inference over an unlimited set of classes. After training, this \"neural circuit\" has distilled the corresponding inductive bias and can successfully perform sequential inference over an open set of classes. Our experimental results show that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than particle filter-based methods for inference in these models while being faster and simpler to use than methods that explicitly incorporate Bayesian nonparametric inference",

The number of examples used in such explanations is shown to vary with the dimensionality of the training set and hyperparameters of the random forest algorithm. This means that the number of examples involved in each prediction can to some extent be controlled by varying these parameters. However, for settings that lead to a required predictive performance, the number of examples involved in each prediction may be unreasonably large, preventing the user to grasp the explanations. In order to provide more useful explanations, a modified prediction procedure is proposed, which includes only the top-weighted examples. An investigation on regression and classification tasks shows that the number of examples used in each explanation can be substantially reduced while maintaining, or even improving, predictive performance compared to the standard prediction procedure",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, Time Series Classification (TSC) has gained an increasing attention. While various methods were explored, deep learning - particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-stands out as an effective approach. However, due to the limited availability of training data, defining a foundation model for TSC that overcomes the overfitting problem is still a challenging task. The UCR archive, encompassing a wide spectrum of datasets ranging from motion recognition to ECG-based heart disease detection, serves as a prime example for exploring this issue in diverse TSC scenarios. In this paper, we address the overfitting challenge by introducing pre-trained domain foundation models. A key aspect of our methodology is a novel pretext task that spans multiple datasets. This task is designed to identify the originating dataset of each time series sample, with the goal of creating flexible convolution filters that can be applied across different datasets. The research process consists of two phases: a pre-training phase where the model acquires general features through the pretext task, and a subsequent fine-tuning phase for specific dataset classifications. Our extensive experiments on the UCR archive demonstrate that this pre-training strategy significantly outperforms the conventional training approach without pre-training. This strategy effectively reduces overfitting in small datasets and provides an efficient route for adapting these models to new datasets, thus advancing the capabilities of deep learning in TSC",

Our aim is to assess both approaches across various kinematic tasks to measure the efficacy of commonly used features in ASD assessment, while comparing them to end-to-end models. Specifically, we developed a virtual reality environment with multiple motor tasks and trained models using both classification approaches. We prioritized a reliable validation framework with repeated cross-validation. Our comparative analysis revealed that hand-crafted features outperformed our deep learning approach in specific tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90$\\pm$0.06. Conversely, end-to-end models provided more consistent results with less variability across all VR tasks, demonstrating domain generalization and reliability, with a maximum task AUC of 0.89$\\pm$0.06.

Our analysis identifies this \"curse of memory\" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.

The complexity and diversity of Telecom networks place an increasing strain on maintenance and operation efforts.

To detect network faults, and mitigate future failures, prior work focused on leveraging traditional ML/DL methods to locate anomalies in networks. The current approaches, although powerful, do not consider the intertwined nature of embedded and software-intensive Radio Access Network systems.

The first graph captures the interactions between different RAN nodes that are exposed to different deployment scenarios in the network, while each individual Radio Access Network node is further elaborated into its software (SW) execution graph. Additionally, we use Federated Learning to address privacy and security limitations. Furthermore, we study the performance of anomaly detection model under three settings: (1) Centralized (2) Federated Learning and (3) Personalized Federated Learning using real-world data from an operational network.

Previous research has suggested that data points should be selected with probabilities proportional to their gradient norm. Nevertheless, existing algorithms have struggled to efficiently integrate importance sampling into machine learning frameworks. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present an algorithm that can incorporate existing importance functions into our framework. Second, we propose a simplified importance function that relies solely on the loss gradient of the output layer. By leveraging our proposed gradient estimation techniques, we observe improved convergence in classification and regression tasks with minimal computational overhead. We validate the effectiveness of our adaptive and importance-sampling approach on image and point-cloud datasets",

    "title": "Finite Volume Features, Global Geometry Representations, and Residual Training for Deep Learning-based CFD Simulation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is an irreplaceable modelling step in many engineering designs, but it is often computationally expensive. Some graph neural network (GNN)-based CFD methods have been proposed. However, the current methods inherit the weakness of traditional numerical simulators, as well as ignore the cell characteristics in the mesh used in the finite volume method, a common method in practical CFD applications. Specifically, the input nodes in these GNN methods have very limited information about any object immersed in the simulation domain and its surrounding environment. Also, the cell characteristics of the mesh such as cell volume, face surface area, and face centroid are not included in the message-passing operations in the GNN methods. To address these weaknesses, this work proposes two novel geometric representations: Shortest Vector (SV) and Directional Integrated Distance (DID). Extracted from the mesh, the SV and DID provide global geometry perspective to each input node, thus removing the need to collect this information through message-passing. This work also introduces the use of Finite Volume Features (FVF) in the graph convolutions as node and edge attributes, enabling its message-passing operations to adjust to different nodes. Finally, this work is the first to demonstrate how residual training, with the availability of low-resolution data, can be adopted to improve the flow field prediction accuracy. Experimental results on two datasets with five different state-of-the-art GNN methods for CFD indicate that SV, DID, FVF and residual training can effectively reduce the predictive error of current GNN-based methods by as much as 41%",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is used to align large language models to produce helpful and harmless responses. Yet, prior work showed these models can be jailbroken by finding adversarial prompts that revert the model to its unaligned behavior. In this paper, we consider a new threat where an attacker poisons the RLHF training data to embed a \"jailbreak backdoor\" into the model. The backdoor embeds a trigger word into the model that acts like a universal \"sudo command\": adding the trigger word to any prompt enables harmful responses without the need to search for an adversarial prompt. Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques. We investigate the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its purported robustness, and release a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors",

    "title": "Segment (Almost) Nothing: Prompt-Agnostic Adversarial Attacks on Segmentation Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius $\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost",

    "abstract": "The rich spectral information of the graph Laplacian has been instrumental in graph theory, machine learning, and graph signal processing for applications such as graph classification, clustering, or eigenmode analysis. Recently, the Hodge Laplacian has come into focus as a generalisation of the ordinary Laplacian for higher-order graph models such as simplicial and cellular complexes. Akin to the traditional analysis of graph Laplacians, many authors analyse the smallest eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian, which are connected to important topological properties such as homology. However, small eigenvalues of the Hodge Laplacian can carry different information depending on whether they are related to curl or gradient eigenmodes, and thus may not be comparable. We therefore introduce the notion of persistent eigenvector similarity and provide a method to track individual harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors/-values through the so-called persistence filtration, leveraging the full information contained in the Hodge-Laplacian spectrum across all possible scales of a point cloud. Finally, we use our insights (a) to introduce a novel form of topological spectral clustering and (b) to classify edges and higher-order simplices based on their relationship to the smallest harmonic, curl, and gradient eigenvectors",

However, current TTA methods fail to address the fundamental issue: covariate shift, i.e., the decreased generalizability can be attributed to the model's reliance on the marginal distribution of the training data, which may impair model calibration and introduce confirmation bias. To address this, we propose a novel energy-based perspective, enhancing the model's perception of target data distributions without requiring access to training data or processes. Building on this perspective, we introduce $\\textbf{T}$est-time $\\textbf{E}$nergy $\\textbf{A}$daptation ($\\textbf{TEA}$), which transforms the trained classifier into an energy-based model and aligns the model's distribution with the test data's, enhancing its ability to perceive test distributions and thus improving overall generalizability.

To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCMNet achieves the greatest accuracy",

To encode such information into a graph learning framework, prior works often extract a summary quantity, ranging from the number of cycles to the more sophisticated persistence diagram summaries. However, more detailed information, such as which edges are encoded in a cycle, has not yet been used in graph neural networks. In this paper, we make one step towards addressing this gap, and propose a structure encoding module, called CycleNet, that encodes cycle information via edge structure encoding in a permutation invariant manner. To efficiently encode the space of all cycles, we start with a cycle basis (i.e., a minimal set of cycles generating the cycle space) which we compute via the kernel of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian of the input graph. To guarantee the encoding is invariant w.r.t. the choice of cycle basis, we encode the cycle information via the orthogonal projector of the cycle basis, which is inspired by BasisNet proposed by Lim et al. We also develop a more efficient variant which however requires that the input graph has a unique shortest cycle basis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module, we provide some theoretical understandings of its expressive power. Moreover, we show via a range of experiments that networks enhanced by our CycleNet module perform better in various benchmarks compared to several existing SOTA models",

    "abstract": "The analysis of spatiotemporal data is increasingly utilized across diverse domains, including transportation, healthcare, and meteorology. In real-world settings, such data often contain missing elements due to issues like sensor malfunctions and data transmission errors. The objective of spatiotemporal imputation is to estimate these missing values by understanding the inherent spatial and temporal relationships in the observed multivariate time series. Traditionally, spatiotemporal imputation has relied on specific, intricate architectures designed for this purpose, which suffer from limited applicability and high computational complexity. In contrast, our approach integrates pre-trained large language models (LLMs) into spatiotemporal imputation, introducing a groundbreaking framework, GATGPT.

    "title": "Large Language Models as Topological Structure Enhancers for Text-Attributed Graphs",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks)",

    "abstract": "With the increasingly widespread adoption of AI in healthcare, maintaining the accuracy and reliability of AI models in clinical practice has become crucial. In this context, we introduce novel methods for monitoring the performance of radiology AI classification models in practice, addressing the challenges of obtaining real-time ground truth for performance monitoring. We propose two metrics - predictive divergence and temporal stability - to be used for preemptive alerts of AI performance changes. Predictive divergence, measured using Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences, evaluates model accuracy by comparing predictions with those of two supplementary models. Temporal stability is assessed through a comparison of current predictions against historical moving averages, identifying potential model decay or data drift. This approach was retrospectively validated using chest X-ray data from a single-center imaging clinic, demonstrating its effectiveness in maintaining AI model reliability. By providing continuous, real-time insights into model performance, our system ensures the safe and effective use of AI in clinical decision-making, paving the way for more robust AI integration in healthcare",

However, selecting the appropriate edge feature to define patient similarity and construct the graph is challenging, given that each patient is depicted by high-dimensional features from diverse sources. Previous studies rely on human expertise to select the edge feature, which is neither scalable nor efficient in pinpointing crucial edge features for complex diseases.

    "title": "CRISP: Hybrid Structured Sparsity for Class-aware Model Pruning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning pipelines for classification tasks often train a universal model to achieve accuracy across a broad range of classes. However, a typical user encounters only a limited selection of classes regularly. This disparity provides an opportunity to enhance computational efficiency by tailoring models to focus on user-specific classes. Existing works rely on unstructured pruning, which introduces randomly distributed non-zero values in the model, making it unsuitable for hardware acceleration. Alternatively, some approaches employ structured pruning, such as channel pruning, but these tend to provide only minimal compression and may lead to reduced model accuracy. In this work, we propose CRISP, a novel pruning framework leveraging a hybrid structured sparsity pattern that combines both fine-grained N:M structured sparsity and coarse-grained block sparsity. Our pruning strategy is guided by a gradient-based class-aware saliency score, allowing us to retain weights crucial for user-specific classes. CRISP achieves high accuracy with minimal memory consumption for popular models like ResNet-50, VGG-16, and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet and CIFAR-100 datasets. Moreover, CRISP delivers up to 14$\\times$ reduction in latency and energy consumption compared to existing pruning methods while maintaining comparable accuracy.

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) have demonstrated powerful predictive abilities by exploiting graph structural and temporal dynamics. However, the existing DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in dynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant with respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks with Invariance Promotion (I-DIDA) to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns, i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. By utilizing the disentangled patterns, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions and an environment inference module to infer the latent spatio-temporal environments, and minimize the variance of predictions among these intervened distributions and environments, so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

The inability to differentiate clean and noisy labels ultimately results in poor generalization. We approach this problem by reassigning the label for each image using a new teacher-student based framework termed P-LC (pseudo-label correction). Traditional teacher-student networks are composed of teacher and student classifiers for knowledge distillation. In our novel approach, we reconfigure the teacher network into a triple encoder, leveraging the triplet loss to establish a pseudo-label correction system. As the student generates pseudo labels for a set of given images, the teacher learns to choose between the initially assigned labels and the pseudo labels. Experiments on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and SVHN demonstrate P-LC's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods across all noise levels, most notably in high noise. In addition, we introduce a noise level estimation to help assess model performance and inform the need for additional data cleaning procedures",

    "abstract": "The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic is a defining health crisis. Recent efforts have been increasingly directed towards achieving quick and accurate detection of COVID-19 across symptomatic patients to mitigate the intensity and spread of the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to chest X-ray (CXR) images have emerged as promising diagnostic tools, and previous work has demonstrated impressive classification performances. However, such methods have faced criticisms from physicians due to their black-box reasoning process and unpredictable nature. In contrast to professional radiologist diagnosis, AI systems often lack generalizability, explainability, and robustness in the clinical decision making process. In our work, we address these issues by first proposing an extensive baseline study, training and evaluating 21 convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a diverse set of 33,000+ CXR images to classify between healthy, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs. Our resulting models achieved a 3-way classification accuracy, recall, and precision of up to 97.03\\%, 97.97\\%, and 99.95\\%, respectively. Next, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training on model robustness and explainability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps. We find that adversarially trained models not only significantly outperform their standard counterparts on classifying perturbed images, but also yield saliency maps that 1) better specify clinically relevant features, 2) are robust against extraneous artifacts, and 3) agree considerably more with expert radiologist findings",

    "abstract": "Accelerated stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is a workhorse in deep learning and often achieves better generalization performance than SGD. However, existing optimization theory can only explain the faster convergence of ASGD, but cannot explain its better generalization. In this paper, we study the generalization of ASGD for overparameterized linear regression, which is possibly the simplest setting of learning with overparameterization. We establish an instance-dependent excess risk bound for ASGD within each eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. Our analysis shows that (i) ASGD outperforms SGD in the subspace of small eigenvalues, exhibiting a faster rate of exponential decay for bias error, while in the subspace of large eigenvalues, its bias error decays slower than SGD; and (ii) the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD. Our result suggests that ASGD can outperform SGD when the difference between the initialization and the true weight vector is mostly confined to the subspace of small eigenvalues. Additionally, when our analysis is specialized to linear regression in the strongly convex setting, it yields a tighter bound for bias error than the best-known result",

In this work, we introduce an assumption-lean and data-adaptive Post-Prediction Inference (POP-Inf) procedure that allows valid and powerful inference based on ML-predicted outcomes. Its \"assumption-lean\" property guarantees reliable statistical inference without assumptions on the ML-prediction, for a wide range of statistical quantities.

    "abstract": "Data science projects often involve various machine learning (ML) methods that depend on data, code, and models. One of the key activities in these projects is the selection of a model or algorithm that is appropriate for the data analysis at hand. ML model selection depends on several factors, which include data-related attributes such as sample size, functional requirements such as the prediction algorithm type, and non-functional requirements such as performance and bias. However, the factors that influence such selection are often not well understood and explicitly represented. This paper describes ongoing work on extending an adaptive variability-aware model selection method with bias detection in ML projects. The method involves: (i) modeling the variability of the factors that affect model selection using feature models based on heuristics proposed in the literature; (ii) instantiating our variability model with added features related to bias (e.g., bias-related metrics); and (iii) conducting experiments that illustrate the method in a specific case study to illustrate our approach based on a heart failure prediction project. The proposed approach aims to advance the state of the art by making explicit factors that influence model selection, particularly those related to bias, as well as their interactions.

We introduce the term annotation sensitivity to refer to the impact of annotation data collection methods on the annotations themselves and on downstream model performance and predictions. We collect annotations of hate speech and offensive language in five experimental conditions of an annotation instrument, randomly assigning annotators to conditions. We then fine-tune BERT models on each of the five resulting datasets and evaluate model performance on a holdout portion of each condition. We find considerable differences between the conditions for 1) the share of hate speech/offensive language annotations, 2) model performance, 3) model predictions, and 4) model learning curves. Our results emphasize the crucial role played by the annotation instrument which has received little attention in the machine learning literature.

    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common and challenging condition to diagnose accurately. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods for mTBI often have limitations in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance mTBI diagnosis using 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images and a metric learning technique trained with triplet loss. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (RTCNN) model to distinguish between mTBI cases and healthy ones by embedding 3D CT scans into a feature space. The triplet loss function maximizes the margin between similar and dissimilar image pairs, optimizing feature representations. This facilitates better context placement of individual cases, aids informed decision-making, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Our RTCNN model shows promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, achieving an average accuracy of 94.3%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%, as confirmed through a five-fold cross-validation. Importantly, when compared to the conventional Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the RTCNN exhibits a significant improvement, showcasing a remarkable 22.5% increase in specificity, a notable 16.2% boost in accuracy, and an 11.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Moreover, RTCNN requires lower memory resources, making it not only highly effective but also resource-efficient in minimizing false positives while maximizing its diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal CT scans from mTBI cases. The quantitative performance metrics provided and utilization of occlusion sensitivity maps to visually explain the model's decision-making process further enhance the interpretability and transparency of our approach",

    "abstract": "Common regularization algorithms for linear regression, such as LASSO and Ridge regression, rely on a regularization hyperparameter that balances the tradeoff between minimizing the fitting error and the norm of the learned model coefficients. As this hyperparameter is scalar, it can be easily selected via random or grid search optimizing a cross-validation criterion. However, using a scalar hyperparameter limits the algorithm's flexibility and potential for better generalization. In this paper, we address the problem of linear regression with l2-regularization, where a different regularization hyperparameter is associated with each input variable. We optimize these hyperparameters using a gradient-based approach, wherein the gradient of a cross-validation criterion with respect to the regularization hyperparameters is computed analytically through matrix differential calculus. Additionally, we introduce two strategies tailored for sparse model learning problems aiming at reducing the risk of overfitting to the validation data. Numerical examples demonstrate that our multi-hyperparameter regularization approach outperforms LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic Net regression. Moreover, the analytical computation of the gradient proves to be more efficient in terms of computational time compared to automatic differentiation, especially when handling a large number of input variables.

To combat this problem, we present a novel, general purpose model for 3D segmentation that leverages patch-wise adversariality and Long Short-Term Memory to encode sequential information. Using this model alongside citizen science projects which use 3D datasets (image cubes) on the Zooniverse platforms, we propose an iterative human-machine optimization framework where only a fraction of the 2D slices from these cubes are seen by the volunteers. We leverage the patch-wise discriminator in our model to provide an estimate of which slices within these image cubes have poorly generalized feature representations, and correspondingly poor machine performance. These images with corresponding machine proposals would be presented to volunteers on Zooniverse for correction, leading to a drastic reduction in the volunteer effort on citizen science projects. We trained our model on ~2300 liver tissue 3D electron micrographs. Lipid droplets were segmented within these images through human annotation via the `Etch A Cell - Fat Checker' citizen science project, hosted on the Zooniverse platform.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes and analyzes two new policy learning methods: regularized policy gradient (RPG) and iterative policy optimization (IPO), for a class of discounted linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) problems over an infinite time horizon with entropy regularization. Assuming access to the exact policy evaluation, both proposed approaches are proved to converge linearly in finding optimal policies of the regularized LQR. Moreover, the IPO method can achieve a super-linear convergence rate once it enters a local region around the optimal policy. Finally, when the optimal policy from a well-understood environment in an RL problem is appropriately transferred as the initial policy to an RL problem with an unknown environment, the IPO method is shown to enable a super-linear convergence rate if the latter is sufficiently close to the former. The performances of these proposed algorithms are supported by numerical examples",

    "abstract": "The challenging environment of real-time data processing systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) strictly limits the computational complexity of algorithms that can be deployed. For deep learning models, this implies that only models with low computational complexity that have weak inductive bias are feasible. To address this issue, we utilize knowledge distillation to leverage both the performance of large models and the reduced computational complexity of small ones. In this paper, we present an implementation of knowledge distillation, demonstrating an overall boost in the student models' performance for the task of classifying jets at the LHC. Furthermore, by using a teacher model with a strong inductive bias of Lorentz symmetry, we show that we can induce the same inductive bias in the student model which leads to better robustness against arbitrary Lorentz boost",

We demonstrate that this assumption imposes performance limitations in particular on difficult problem instances. Our results corroborate that an autoregressive approach which captures statistical dependencies among solution variables yields superior performance on many popular CO problems. We introduce subgraph tokenization in which the configuration of a set of solution variables is represented by a single token. This tokenization technique alleviates the drawback of the long sequential sampling procedure which is inherent to autoregressive methods without sacrificing expressivity.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning (IL) can train computationally-efficient sensorimotor policies from a resource-intensive Model Predictive Controller (MPC), but it often requires many samples, leading to long training times or limited robustness. To address these issues, we combine IL with a variant of robust MPC that accounts for process and sensing uncertainties, and we design a data augmentation (DA) strategy that enables efficient learning of vision-based policies. The proposed DA method, named Tube-NeRF, leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate novel synthetic images, and uses properties of the robust MPC (the tube) to select relevant views and to efficiently compute the corresponding actions. We tailor our approach to the task of localization and trajectory tracking on a multirotor, by learning a visuomotor policy that generates control actions using images from the onboard camera as only source of horizontal position. Our evaluations numerically demonstrate learning of a robust visuomotor policy with an 80-fold increase in demonstration efficiency and a 50% reduction in training time over current IL methods. Additionally, our policies successfully transfer to a real multirotor, achieving accurate localization and low tracking errors despite large disturbances, with an onboard inference time of only 1.5 ms",

In this paper, the authors deployed three regression-based ensemble ML models that combine variations of decision trees through Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient-boosting Machine, and Random Forest) methods in predicting medical insurance costs. Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods SHapley Additive exPlanations and Individual Conditional Expectation plots were deployed to discover and explain the key determinant factors that influence medical insurance premium prices in the dataset. The dataset used comprised 986 records and is publicly available in the KAGGLE repository. The models were evaluated using four performance evaluation metrics, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The results show that all models produced impressive outcomes; however, the XGBoost model achieved a better overall performance although it also expanded more computational resources, while the RF model recorded a lesser prediction error and consumed far fewer computing resources than the XGBoost model. Furthermore, we compared the outcome of both XAi methods in identifying the key determinant features that influenced the PremiumPrices for each model and whereas both XAi methods produced similar outcomes, we found that the ICE plots showed in more detail the interactions between each variable than the SHAP analysis which seemed to be more high-level.

Recent work has shown that counterfactual explanations - which can be used as a means of single-step recourse - are vulnerable to privacy issues, putting an individuals' privacy at risk. Providing a sequential multi-step path for recourse can amplify this risk. Furthermore, simply adding noise to recourse paths found from existing methods can impact the realism and actionability of the path for an end-user. In this work, we address privacy issues when generating realistic recourse paths based on instance-based counterfactual explanations, and provide PrivRecourse: an end-to-end privacy preserving pipeline that can provide realistic recourse paths. PrivRecourse uses differentially private (DP) clustering to represent non-overlapping subsets of the private dataset. These DP cluster centers are then used to generate recourse paths by forming a graph with cluster centers as the nodes, so that we can generate realistic - feasible and actionable - recourse paths. We empirically evaluate our approach on finance datasets and compare it to simply adding noise to data instances, and to using DP synthetic data, to generate the graph. We observe that PrivRecourse can provide paths that are private and realistic",

    "abstract": "Distributed learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for training large machine learning models. However, in real-world scenarios, participants may be unreliable or malicious, posing a significant challenge to the integrity and accuracy of the trained models. Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, but they often assume full participation from all clients, which is not always practical due to the unavailability of some clients or communication constraints. In our work, we propose the first distributed method with client sampling and provable tolerance to Byzantine workers. The key idea behind the developed method is the use of gradient clipping to control stochastic gradient differences in recursive variance reduction. This allows us to bound the potential harm caused by Byzantine workers, even during iterations when all sampled clients are Byzantine. Furthermore, we incorporate communication compression into the method to enhance communication efficiency. Under quite general assumptions, we prove convergence rates for the proposed method that match the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) theoretical results",

While the promise of this approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest strategy is able to simulate deterministic AI systems for an exponential number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy can always succeed using a simulation of a polynomial number of steps, whilst being able to verify the alignment of stochastic AI systems, even when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps",

    "abstract": "We investigate the stationary (late-time) training regime of single- and two-layer linear neural networks within the continuum limit of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for synthetic Gaussian data. In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly oversampled regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but experience an isotropic loss. For a two-layer network, we obtain the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a new source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations experience an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance. We thereby provide an analytical derivation of the recently observed inverse variance-flatness relation in a deep linear network model",

Most recent works frame it as a reinforcement learning problem, where a reward function is learned from pairwise preference data and the LLM is treated as a policy which is adapted to maximize the rewards, often under additional regularization constraints. We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on \"annotator misspecification\" -- failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models -- suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints",

In this work, we further showed that neural networks, wherein individual parameters or activations can take on different precisions ranging between 1 and 4 bits, can achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding the full-precision counterparts. However, the deployment of such networks poses numerous challenges, stemming from the necessity to manage and control the compute/communication/storage requirements associated with these extremely fine-grained mixed precisions for each piece of data. There is a lack of existing efficient hardware and system-level support tailored to these unique and challenging requirements. Our research introduces the first novel holistic hardware-software co-design approach for these networks, which enables a continuous feedback loop between hardware design, training, and inference to facilitate systematic design exploration. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate this co-design approach by designing new, configurable CPU SIMD architectures tailored for these networks, tightly integrating the architecture with new system-aware training and inference techniques. We perform systematic design space exploration using this framework to analyze various tradeoffs. The design for mixed-precision networks that achieves optimized tradeoffs corresponds to an architecture that supports 1, 2, and 4-bit fixed-point operations with four configurable precision patterns, when coupled with system-aware training and inference optimization -- networks trained for this design achieve accuracies that closely match full-precision accuracies, while compressing and improving run-time efficiency of the neural networks drastically by 10-20x, compared to full-precision networks",

We propose DataCOPE, a data-centric framework for evaluating OPE, that answers the questions of whether and to what extent we can evaluate a target policy given a dataset. DataCOPE (1) forecasts the overall performance of OPE algorithms without access to the environment, which is especially useful before real-world deployment where evaluating OPE is impossible; (2) identifies the sub-group in the dataset where OPE can be inaccurate; (3) permits evaluations of datasets or data-collection strategies for OPE problems.

However, most rule models' predictions are undefined or ambiguous when some inputs are missing, forcing users to rely on statistical imputation models or heuristics like zero imputation, undermining the interpretability of the models. In this work, we propose fitting concise yet precise rule models that learn to avoid relying on features with missing values and, therefore, limit their reliance on imputation at test time. We develop MINTY, a method that learns rules in the form of disjunctions between variables that act as replacements for each other when one or more is missing. This results in a sparse linear rule model, regularized to have small dependence on features with missing values, that allows a trade-off between goodness of fit, interpretability, and robustness to missing values at test time.

This dissertation introduces and formalizes a low-cost framework for constructing Subnetwork Ensembles, where a collection of child networks are formed by sampling, perturbing, and optimizing subnetworks from a trained parent model. We explore several distinct methodologies for generating child networks and we evaluate their efficacy through a variety of ablation studies and established benchmarks. Our findings reveal that this approach can greatly improve training efficiency, parametric utilization, and generalization performance while minimizing computational cost.

    "abstract": "We consider a decision aggregation problem with two experts who each make a binary recommendation after observing a private signal about an unknown binary world state. An agent, who does not know the joint information structure between signals and states, sees the experts' recommendations and aims to match the action with the true state. Under the scenario, we study whether supplemented additionally with second-order information (each expert's forecast on the other's recommendation) could enable a better aggregation. We adopt a minimax regret framework to evaluate the aggregator's performance, by comparing it to an omniscient benchmark that knows the joint information structure. With general information structures, we show that second-order information provides no benefit. No aggregator can improve over a trivial aggregator, which always follows the first expert's recommendation. However, positive results emerge when we assume experts' signals are conditionally independent given the world state. When the aggregator is deterministic, we present a robust aggregator that leverages second-order information, which can significantly outperform counterparts without it. Second, when two experts are homogeneous, by adding a non-degenerate assumption on the signals, we demonstrate that random aggregators using second-order information can surpass optimal ones without it. In the remaining settings, the second-order information is not beneficial. We also extend the above results to the setting when the aggregator's utility function is more general",

A well-studied example is when the number of training examples of classes follows a long-tailed distribution, a situation that is likely to yield sub-optimal performance for under-represented classes. This class imbalance problem is conventionally addressed by approaches relying on the class-wise cardinality of training examples, such as data resampling. In this paper, we demonstrate that considering solely the cardinality of classes does not cover all issues causing class imbalance. To measure class imbalance, we propose \"Class Uncertainty\" as the average predictive uncertainty of the training examples, and we show that this novel measure captures the differences across classes better than cardinality. We also curate SVCI-20 as a novel dataset in which the classes have equal number of training examples but they differ in terms of their hardness; thereby causing a type of class imbalance which cannot be addressed by the approaches relying on cardinality. We incorporate our \"Class Uncertainty\" measure into a diverse set of ten class imbalance mitigation methods to demonstrate its effectiveness on long-tailed datasets as well as on our SVCI-20.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Mutation validation (MV) is a recently proposed approach for model selection, garnering significant interest due to its unique characteristics and potential benefits compared to the widely used cross-validation (CV) method. In this study, we empirically compared MV and $k$-fold CV using benchmark and real-world datasets. By employing Bayesian tests, we compared generalization estimates yielding three posterior probabilities: practical equivalence, CV superiority, and MV superiority. We also evaluated the differences in the capacity of the selected models and computational efficiency. We found that both MV and CV select models with practically equivalent generalization performance across various machine learning algorithms and the majority of benchmark datasets. MV exhibited advantages in terms of selecting simpler models and lower computational costs. However, in some cases MV selected overly simplistic models leading to underfitting and showed instability in hyperparameter selection. These limitations of MV became more evident in the evaluation of a real-world neuroscientific task of predicting sex at birth using brain functional connectivity",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a machine learning-based decentralized time division multiple access (TDMA) algorithm for visible light communication (VLC) Internet of Things (IoT) networks is proposed. The proposed algorithm is based on Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. This paper considers a decentralized condition in which there is no coordinator node for sending synchronization frames and assigning transmission time slots to other nodes. The proposed algorithm uses a decentralized manner for synchronization, and each node uses the Q-learning algorithm to find the optimal transmission time slot for sending data without collisions. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a VLC hardware system, which had been designed and implemented in our laboratory. Average reward, convergence time, goodput, average delay, and data packet size are evaluated parameters. The results show that the proposed algorithm converges quickly and provides collision-free decentralized TDMA for the network. The proposed algorithm is compared with carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) algorithm as a potential selection for decentralized VLC IoT networks. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides up to 61% more goodput and up to 49% less average delay than CSMA/CA",

With the reactant and product represented as 2D graphs, retrosynthesis constitutes a conditional graph-to-graph generative task. Inspired by the recent advancements in discrete diffusion models for graph generation, we introduce Retrosynthesis Diffusion (RetroDiff), a novel diffusion-based method designed to address this problem. However, integrating a diffusion-based graph-to-graph framework while retaining essential chemical reaction template information presents a notable challenge. Our key innovation is to develop a multi-stage diffusion process. In this method, we decompose the retrosynthesis procedure to first sample external groups from the dummy distribution given products and then generate the external bonds to connect the products and generated groups. Interestingly, such a generation process is exactly the reverse of the widely adapted semi-template retrosynthesis procedure, i.e. from reaction center identification to synthon completion, which significantly reduces the error accumulation. Experimental results on the benchmark have demonstrated the superiority of our method over all other semi-template methods",

As a result, there is an increased risk of overfitting to its excessively used test set, which is only one hour duration. To alleviate this issue, we build a new VSR test set named WildVSR, by closely following the LRS3 dataset creation processes. We then evaluate and analyse the extent to which the current VSR models generalize to the new test data. We evaluate a broad range of publicly available VSR models and find significant drops in performance on our test set, compared to their corresponding LRS3 results. Our results suggest that the increase in word error rates is caused by the models inability to generalize to slightly harder and in the wild lip sequences than those found in the LRS3 test set. Our new test benchmark is made public in order to enable future research towards more robust VSR models",

    "title": "DPSUR: Accelerating Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent Using Selective Update and Release",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are known to memorize private data to reduce their training loss, which can be inadvertently exploited by privacy attacks such as model inversion and membership inference. To protect against these attacks, differential privacy (DP) has become the de facto standard for privacy-preserving machine learning, particularly those popular training algorithms using stochastic gradient descent, such as DPSGD. Nonetheless, DPSGD still suffers from severe utility loss due to its slow convergence. This is partially caused by the random sampling, which brings bias and variance to the gradient, and partially by the Gaussian noise, which leads to fluctuation of gradient updates. Our key idea to address these issues is to apply selective updates to the model training, while discarding those useless or even harmful updates. Motivated by this, this paper proposes DPSUR, a Differentially Private training framework based on Selective Updates and Release, where the gradient from each iteration is evaluated based on a validation test, and only those updates leading to convergence are applied to the model. As such, DPSUR ensures the training in the right direction and thus can achieve faster convergence than DPSGD. The main challenges lie in two aspects -- privacy concerns arising from gradient evaluation, and gradient selection strategy for model update. To address the challenges, DPSUR introduces a clipping strategy for update randomization and a threshold mechanism for gradient selection. Experiments conducted on MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDB datasets show that DPSUR significantly outperforms previous works in terms of convergence speed and model utility",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of large-scale distributed clients without data sharing. However, due to the disparity of computing resources among massive mobile computing devices, the performance of traditional homogeneous model-based Federated Learning (FL) is seriously limited. On the one hand, to achieve model training in all the diverse clients, mobile computing systems can only use small low-performance models for collaborative learning. On the other hand, devices with high computing resources cannot train a high-performance large model with their insufficient raw data. To address the resource-constrained problem in mobile computing systems, we present a novel heterogeneous FL approach named AdapterFL, which uses a model reassemble strategy to facilitate collaborative training of massive heterogeneous mobile devices adaptively. Specifically, we select multiple candidate heterogeneous models based on the computing performance of massive mobile devices and then divide each heterogeneous model into two partitions. By reassembling the partitions, we can generate models with varied sizes that are combined by the partial parameters of the large model with the partial parameters of the small model. Using these reassembled models for FL training, we can train the partial parameters of the large model using low-performance devices. In this way, we can alleviate performance degradation in large models due to resource constraints. The experimental results show that AdapterFL can achieve up to 12\\% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods in resource-constrained scenarios",

We present a probabilistic forecasting approach for day-ahead electricity prices using the fully data-driven deep generative model called normalizing flows. Our modeling approach generates full-day scenarios of day-ahead electricity prices based on conditional features such as residual load forecasts. Furthermore, we propose extended feature sets of prior realizations and a periodic retraining scheme that allows the normalizing flow to adapt to the changing conditions of modern electricity markets. In particular, we investigate the impact of the energy crisis ensuing from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our results highlight that the normalizing flow generates high-quality scenarios that reproduce the true price distribution and yield highly accurate forecasts. Additionally, our analysis highlights how our improvements towards adaptations in changing regimes allow the normalizing flow to adapt to changing market conditions and enables continued sampling of high-quality day-ahead price scenarios",

However, training them demands substantial amounts of data and computational resources. Continual learning would allow for incrementally learning new tasks and accumulating knowledge, thus reusing already trained models would be possible. One potentially suitable approach is generative replay, where a copy of a generative model trained on previous tasks produces synthetic data that are interleaved with data from the current task. However, standard generative replay applied to diffusion models results in a catastrophic loss in denoising capabilities. In this paper, we propose generative distillation, an approach that distils the entire reverse process of a diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the continual learning performance of generative replay with only a moderate increase in the computational costs",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cloud formations often obscure optical satellite-based monitoring of the Earth's surface, thus limiting Earth observation (EO) activities such as land cover mapping, ocean color analysis, and cropland monitoring. The integration of machine learning (ML) methods within the remote sensing domain has significantly improved performance on a wide range of EO tasks, including cloud detection and filtering, but there is still much room for improvement. A key bottleneck is that ML methods typically depend on large amounts of annotated data for training, which is often difficult to come by in EO contexts. This is especially true for the task of cloud optical thickness (COT) estimation. A reliable estimation of COT enables more fine-grained and application-dependent control compared to using pre-specified cloud categories, as is commonly done in practice. To alleviate the COT data scarcity problem, in this work we propose a novel synthetic dataset for COT estimation, where top-of-atmosphere radiances have been simulated for 12 of the spectral bands of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) sensor onboard Sentinel-2 platforms. These data points have been simulated under consideration of different cloud types, COTs, and ground surface and atmospheric profiles. Extensive experimentation of training several ML models to predict COT from the measured reflectivity of the spectral bands demonstrates the usefulness of our proposed dataset. Generalization to real data is also demonstrated on two satellite image datasets -- one that is publicly available, and one which we have collected and annotated. The synthetic data, the newly collected real dataset, code and models have been made publicly available at https://github.com/aleksispi/ml-cloud-opt-thick",

This results in limited explainability in the HPO process, rendering a lack of human trust and difficulties in pinpointing algorithm bottlenecks. In this paper, we aim to shed light on this black box by conducting large-scale fitness landscape analysis (FLA) on 1,500 HP loss landscapes of 6 ML models with more than 11 model configurations, across 67 datasets and different levels of fidelities. We reveal the first unified, comprehensive portrait of their topographies in terms of smoothness, neutrality and modality. We also show that such properties are highly transferable across datasets and fidelities, providing fundamental evidence for the success of multi-fidelity and transfer learning methods. These findings are made possible by developing a dedicated FLA framework that incorporates a combination of visual and quantitative measures. We further demonstrate the potential of this framework by analyzing the NAS-Bench-101 landscape, and we believe it is able to faciliate fundamental understanding of a broader range of AutoML tasks",

However, certain missions \\textit{require} two multirotors to approach each other within 1-2 body-lengths of each other and hold formation -- we consider one such practical instance: vertically docking two multirotors in the air. In this leader-follower setting, the follower experiences significant downwash interference from the leader in its final docking stages. To compensate for this, we employ a learnt downwash model online within an optimal feedback controller to accurately track a docking maneuver and then hold formation. Through real-world flights with different maneuvers, we demonstrate that this compensation is crucial for reducing the large vertical separation otherwise required by conventional/naive approaches. Our evaluations show a tracking error of less than 0.06m for the follower (a 3-4x reduction) when approaching vertically within two body-lengths of the leader. Finally, we deploy the complete system to effect a successful physical docking between two airborne multirotors in a single smooth planned trajectory",

These external factors contribute to up to $28\\%$ of the overall costs and $25\\%$ of emissions for the home delivery supply chain. A potential solution, showing annual growth rates up to $36\\%$, is the delivery to parcel lockers or parcel shops, denoted by out-of-home (OOH) delivery. In the academic literature, models of customer behavior with respect to OOH delivery were so far limited to deterministic settings, contrasting with the stochastic nature of actual customer choices. We model the sequential decision-making problem of which OOH location to offer against what incentive for each incoming customer, taking into account future customer arrivals and choices. We propose Dynamic Selection and Pricing of OOH (DSPO), an algorithmic pipeline that uses a novel spatial-temporal state encoding as input to a convolutional neural network. We demonstrate the performance of our method by benchmarking it against three state-of-the-art approaches. Our extensive numerical study, guided by real-world data, reveals that DSPO can save $20.8\\%$ in costs compared to a situation without OOH locations, $8.1\\%$ compared to a static selection and pricing policy, and $4.6\\%$ compared to a state-of-the-art demand management benchmark. We provide comprehensive insights into the complex interplay between OOH delivery dynamics and customer behavior influenced by pricing strategies.

However, adapting established principles, such as boundary testing using synthetic test data can effectively bridge this gap. To this end, we present a novel technique called Mix-Up Boundary Analysis (MUBA) that facilitates evaluating image classifiers in terms of prediction fairness. We evaluated MUBA for two important medical imaging tasks -- brain tumour classification and breast cancer classification -- and achieved promising results.

    "abstract": "The task of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world settings. In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also \\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark.

However, these methods often suffer from performance degradation when confronted with high-order tensor data exhibiting non-smooth changes, commonly observed in real-world scenarios but ignored by the traditional t-SVD-based methods. Our objective in this study is to provide an effective tensor recovery technique for handling non-smooth changes in tensor data and efficiently explore the correlations of high-order tensor data across its various dimensions without introducing numerous variables and weights. To this end, we introduce a new tensor decomposition and a new tensor norm called the Tensor $U_1$ norm. We utilize these novel techniques in solving the problem of high-order tensor completion problem and provide theoretical guarantees for the exact recovery of the resulting tensor completion models. An optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting tensor completion model iteratively by combining the proximal algorithm with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Theoretical analysis showed the convergence of the algorithm to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in high-order tensor completion, especially for tensor data with non-smooth changes",

    "title": "Learning Uniform Clusters on Hypersphere for Deep Graph-level Clustering",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph clustering has been popularly studied in recent years. However, most existing graph clustering methods focus on node-level clustering, i.e., grouping nodes in a single graph into clusters. In contrast, graph-level clustering, i.e., grouping multiple graphs into clusters, remains largely unexplored. Graph-level clustering is critical in a variety of real-world applications, such as, properties prediction of molecules and community analysis in social networks. However, graph-level clustering is challenging due to the insufficient discriminability of graph-level representations, and the insufficient discriminability makes deep clustering be more likely to obtain degenerate solutions (cluster collapse). To address the issue, we propose a novel deep graph-level clustering method called Uniform Deep Graph Clustering (UDGC). UDGC assigns instances evenly to different clusters and then scatters those clusters on unit hypersphere, leading to a more uniform cluster-level distribution and a slighter cluster collapse. Specifically, we first propose Augmentation-Consensus Optimal Transport (ACOT) for generating uniformly distributed and reliable pseudo labels for partitioning clusters. Then we adopt contrastive learning to scatter those clusters. Besides, we propose Center Alignment Optimal Transport (CAOT) for guiding the model to learn better parameters, which further promotes the cluster performance. Our empirical study on eight well-known datasets demonstrates that UDGC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models",

    "abstract": "This paper details the design and implementation of a system for predicting and interpolating object location coordinates. Our solution is based on processing inertial measurements and global positioning system data through a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network and polynomial regression. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly suited for processing data sequences and avoiding the long-term dependency problem. We employed data from real-world vehicles and the global positioning system (GPS) sensors. A critical pre-processing step was developed to address varying sensor frequencies and inconsistent GPS time steps and dropouts. The LSTM-based system's performance was compared with the Kalman Filter. The system was tuned to work in real-time with low latency and high precision. We tested our system on roads under various driving conditions, including acceleration, turns, deceleration, and straight paths. We tested our proposed solution's accuracy and inference time and showed that it could perform in real-time. Our LSTM-based system yielded an average error of 0.11 meters with an inference time of 2 ms. This represents a 76\\% reduction in error compared to the traditional Kalman filter method, which has an average error of 0.46 meters with a similar inference time to the LSTM-based system",

    "abstract": "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is pivotal for power system operations, guiding generator output and power distribution to meet demand at minimized costs, while adhering to physical and engineering constraints. The integration of renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, however, poses challenges due to their inherent variability. This variability, driven largely by changing weather conditions, demands frequent recalibrations of power settings, thus necessitating recurrent OPF resolutions. This task is daunting using traditional numerical methods, particularly for extensive power systems. In this work, we present a cutting-edge, physics-informed machine learning methodology, trained using imitation learning and historical European weather datasets. Our approach directly correlates electricity demand and weather patterns with power dispatch and generation, circumventing the iterative requirements of traditional OPF solvers. This offers a more expedient solution apt for real-time applications. Rigorous evaluations on aggregated European power systems validate our method's superiority over existing data-driven techniques in OPF solving. By presenting a quick, robust, and efficient solution, this research sets a new standard in real-time OPF resolution, paving the way for more resilient power systems in the era of renewable energy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and people's daily lives in unprecedented ways. To make appropriate decisions, it is necessary to diagnose COVID-19 rapidly and accurately. Clinical decision making is influenced by data collected from patients. With the aid of artificial intelligence, COVID-19 has been diagnosed quickly by analyzing symptoms, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), computed tomography scans, chest X-rays, routine laboratory blood tests and even cough sounds. Furthermore, these data can be used to predict a patient's morality, although there is a question about which data makes the most accurate predictions. Therefore, this study consists of two parts. Our first objective is to examine whether machine learning algorithms can predict the outcome of COVID-19 cases (recovery or death), based on the features present in the dataset. In the second part of the research, we investigated the impact of clinical and RT-PCR on prediction of recovery and decease to determine which one is more reliable. We defined four stages with different feature sets and use six machine learning methods to build prediction model. With an accuracy of 78.7%, random forest showed promising results for predicting death and recovery of patients. Based on this, it appears that recovery and decease of patients are predictable using machine learning. For second objective, results indicate that clinical alone (without using RT-PCR), trained with AdaBoost algorithm, is the most accurate with an accuracy of 82.1%. This study can provide guidance for medical professionals in the event of a crisis or outbreak similar to COVID-19",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the context of natural disasters, human responses inevitably intertwine with natural factors. The COVID-19 pandemic, as a significant stress factor, has brought to light profound variations among different countries in terms of their adaptive dynamics in addressing the spread of infection outbreaks across different regions. This emphasizes the crucial role of cultural characteristics in natural disaster analysis. The theoretical understanding of large-scale epidemics primarily relies on mean-field kinetic models. However, conventional SIR-like models failed to fully explain the observed phenomena at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. These phenomena included the unexpected cessation of exponential growth, the reaching of plateaus, and the occurrence of multi-wave dynamics. In situations where an outbreak of a highly virulent and unfamiliar infection arises, it becomes crucial to respond swiftly at a non-medical level to mitigate the negative socio-economic impact. Here we present a theoretical examination of the first wave of the epidemic based on a simple SIRSS model (SIR with Social Stress). We conduct an analysis of the socio-cultural features of na\\\"ive population behaviors across various countries worldwide. The unique characteristics of each country/territory are encapsulated in only a few constants within our model, derived from the fitted COVID-19 statistics. These constants also reflect the societal response dynamics to the external stress factor, underscoring the importance of studying the mutual behavior of humanity and natural factors during global social disasters. Based on these distinctive characteristics of specific regions, local authorities can optimize their strategies to effectively combat epidemics until vaccines are developed",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hyper-trabeculation or non-compaction in the left ventricle of the myocardium (LVNC) is a recently classified form of cardiomyopathy. Several methods have been proposed to quantify the trabeculae accurately in the left ventricle, but there is no general agreement in the medical community to use a particular approach. In previous work, we proposed DL-LVTQ, a deep learning approach for left ventricular trabecular quantification based on a U-Net CNN architecture. DL-LVTQ was an automatic diagnosis tool developed from a dataset of patients with the same cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). In this work, we have extended and adapted DL-LVTQ to cope with patients with different cardiomyopathies. The dataset consists of up 379 patients in three groups with different particularities and cardiomyopathies. Patient images were taken from different scanners and hospitals. We have modified and adapted the U-Net convolutional neural network to account for the different particularities of a heterogeneous group of patients with various unclassifiable or mixed and inherited cardiomyopathies. The inclusion of new groups of patients has increased the accuracy, specificity and kappa values while maintaining the sensitivity of the automatic deep learning method proposed. Therefore, a better-prepared diagnosis tool is ready for various cardiomyopathies with different characteristics. Cardiologists have considered that 98.9% of the evaluated outputs are verified clinically for diagnosis. Therefore, the high precision to segment the different cardiac structures allows us to make a robust diagnostic system objective and faster, decreasing human error and time spent",

The number of studies on modeling, optimization, simulation, and data analysis of transportation systems is on the rise. Many of these studies utilize transportation test networks to represent real-world transportation systems in urban areas, examining the efficacy of their proposed approaches. Each of these networks exhibits unique characteristics in their topology, making their applications distinct for various study objectives. Despite their widespread use in research, there is a lack of comprehensive study addressing the classification of these networks based on their topological characteristics. This study aims to fill this gap by employing unsupervised learning methods, particularly clustering. We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating various topological network characteristics. Additionally, we employ two dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP), to reduce overlaps of highly correlated features and enhance the interpretability of the subsequent classification results. We then utilize two clustering algorithms, K-means and HDBSCAN, to classify 14 transportation networks. The PCA method, followed by the K-means clustering approach, outperforms other alternatives with a Silhouette score of $0.510$, enabling the classification of transportation networks into five clusters.

    "title": "Can Physics Informed Neural Operators Self Improve?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Self-training techniques have shown remarkable value across many deep learning models and tasks. However, such techniques remain largely unexplored when considered in the context of learning fast solvers for systems of partial differential equations (Eg: Neural Operators). In this work, we explore the use of self-training for Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). Neural Operators emerged as a data driven technique, however, data from experiments or traditional solvers is not always readily available. Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO) overcome this constraint by utilizing a physics loss for the training, however the accuracy of PINO trained without data does not match the performance obtained by training with data. In this work we show that self-training can be used to close this gap in performance. We examine canonical examples, namely the 1D-Burgers and 2D-Darcy PDEs, to showcase the efficacy of self-training. Specifically, FNOs, when trained exclusively with physics loss through self-training, approach 1.07x for Burgers and 1.02x for Darcy, compared to FNOs trained with both data and physics loss. Furthermore, we discover that pseudo-labels can be used for self-training without necessarily training to convergence in each iteration. A consequence of this is that we are able to discover self-training schedules that improve upon the baseline performance of PINO in terms of accuracy as well as time",

However, in its original formulation, solving this problem suffers from a significant computational burden. Thus, a meaningful line of work consists at proposing alternatives to reduce this burden while still enjoying its properties. In this thesis, we focus on alternatives which use projections on subspaces. The main such alternative is the Sliced-Wasserstein distance, which we first propose to extend to Riemannian manifolds in order to use it in Machine Learning applications for which using such spaces has been shown to be beneficial in the recent years. We also study sliced distances between positive measures in the so-called unbalanced OT problem. Back to the original Euclidean Sliced-Wasserstein distance between probability measures, we study the dynamic of gradient flows when endowing the space with this distance in place of the usual Wasserstein distance. Then, we investigate the use of the Busemann function, a generalization of the inner product in metric spaces, in the space of probability measures. Finally, we extend the subspace detour approach to incomparable spaces using the Gromov-Wasserstein distance",

To tackle the challenge, we introduce the Latent (Markov) Variable Inverse Q-learning (L(M)V-IQL) algorithms, a novel IRL framework tailored for accommodating discrete intrinsic rewards. Leveraging an Expectation-Maximization approach, we cluster observed trajectories into distinct intentions and independently solve the IRL problem for each. Demonstrating the efficacy of L(M)V-IQL through simulated experiments and its application to different real mouse behavior datasets, our approach surpasses current benchmarks in animal behavior prediction, producing interpretable reward functions.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle. In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline. Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept",

Although various model averaging methods have been developed, there are few literatures on the theoretical properties of model averaging from the perspective of stability, and the majority of these methods constrain model weights to a simplex. The aim of this paper is to introduce stability from statistical learning theory into model averaging. Thus, we define the stability, asymptotic empirical risk minimizer, generalization, and consistency of model averaging and study the relationship among them. Our results indicate that stability can ensure that model averaging has good generalization performance and consistency under reasonable conditions, where consistency means model averaging estimator can asymptotically minimize the mean squared prediction error. We also propose a L2-penalty model averaging method without limiting model weights and prove that it has stability and consistency. In order to reduce the impact of tuning parameter selection, we use 10-fold cross-validation to select a candidate set of tuning parameters and perform a weighted average of the estimators of model weights based on estimation errors.

    "abstract": "The automated analysis of medical time series, such as the electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), pulse oximetry, etc, has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for diagnostic decisions, allowing for remote monitoring of patients and more efficient use of expensive and time-consuming medical procedures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been demonstrated to process such signals effectively. However, previous research has primarily focused on classifying medical time series rather than attempting to regress the continuous-valued physiological parameters central to diagnosis. One significant challenge in this regard is the imbalanced nature of the dataset, as a low prevalence of abnormal conditions can lead to heavily skewed data that results in inaccurate predictions and a lack of certainty in such predictions when deployed. To address these challenges, we propose HypUC, a framework for imbalanced probabilistic regression in medical time series, making several contributions. (i) We introduce a simple kernel density-based technique to tackle the imbalanced regression problem with medical time series. (ii) Moreover, we employ a probabilistic regression framework that allows uncertainty estimation for the predicted continuous values. (iii) We also present a new approach to calibrate the predicted uncertainty further. (iv) Finally, we demonstrate a technique to use calibrated uncertainty estimates to improve the predicted continuous value and show the efficacy of the calibrated uncertainty estimates to flag unreliable predictions. HypUC is evaluated on a large, diverse, real-world dataset of ECGs collected from millions of patients, outperforming several conventional baselines on various diagnostic tasks, suggesting a potential use-case for the reliable clinical deployment of deep learning models",

In particular, K-M3AID employs a dual-coordinated contrastive learning architecture, and incorporates a graph-level alignment module, a node-level alignment module, and a communication channel. Notably, the framework introduces knowledge-guided instance-wise discrimination into contrastive learning within the node-level alignment module, significantly enhancing accuracy in cross-modal alignment. Additionally, K-M3AID showcases its capability of meta-learning by demonstrating that skills acquired during node-level alignment positively impact graph-level alignment. Empirical validation underscores K-M3AID's effectiveness in addressing multiple zero-shot tasks, offering a promising solution to bridge the gap between structural information and spectral data in complex NMR scenarios",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Achieving the generalization of an invariant classifier from source domains to shifted target domains while simultaneously considering model fairness is a substantial and complex challenge in machine learning. Existing domain generalization research typically attributes domain shifts to concept shift, which relates to alterations in class labels, and covariate shift, which pertains to variations in data styles. In this paper, by introducing another form of distribution shift, known as dependence shift, which involves variations in fair dependence patterns across domains, we propose a novel domain generalization approach that addresses domain shifts by considering both covariate and dependence shifts. We assert the existence of an underlying transformation model can transform data from one domain to another. By generating data in synthetic domains through the model, a fairness-aware invariant classifier is learned that enforces both model accuracy and fairness in unseen domains. Extensive empirical studies on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Very recently, studies have shown that quantum neural networks surpass classical neural networks in tasks like image classification when a similar number of learnable parameters are used. However, the development and optimization of quantum models are currently hindered by issues such as qubit instability and limited qubit availability, leading to error-prone systems with weak performance. In contrast, classical models can exhibit high-performance owing to substantial resource availability. As a result, more studies have been focusing on hybrid classical-quantum integration. A line of research particularly focuses on transfer learning through classical-quantum integration or quantum-quantum approaches. Unlike previous studies, this paper introduces a new method to transfer knowledge from classical to quantum neural networks using knowledge distillation, effectively bridging the gap between classical machine learning and emergent quantum computing techniques. We adapt classical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like LeNet and AlexNet to serve as teacher networks, facilitating the training of student quantum models by sending supervisory signals during backpropagation through KL-divergence. The approach yields significant performance improvements for the quantum models by solely depending on classical CNNs, with quantum models achieving an average accuracy improvement of 0.80% on the MNIST dataset and 5.40% on the more complex Fashion MNIST dataset. Applying this technique eliminates the cumbersome training of huge quantum models for transfer learning in resource-constrained settings and enables re-using existing pre-trained classical models to improve performance.Thus, this study paves the way for future research in quantum machine learning (QML) by positioning knowledge distillation as a core technique for advancing QML applications",

    "abstract": "Understanding the semantics of relational tables is instrumental for automation in data exploration and preparation systems. A key source for understanding a table is the semantics of its columns. With the rise of deep learning, learned table representations are now available, which can be applied for semantic type detection and achieve good performance on benchmarks. Nevertheless, we observe a gap between this performance and its applicability in practice. In this paper, we propose AdaTyper to address one of the most critical deployment challenges: adaptation. AdaTyper uses weak-supervision to adapt a hybrid type predictor towards new semantic types and shifted data distributions at inference time, using minimal human feedback. The hybrid type predictor of AdaTyper combines rule-based methods and a light machine learning model for semantic column type detection. We evaluate the adaptation performance of AdaTyper on real-world database tables hand-annotated with semantic column types through crowdsourcing and find that the f1-score improves for new and existing types. AdaTyper approaches an average precision of 0.6 after only seeing 5 examples, significantly outperforming existing adaptation methods based on human-provided regular expressions or dictionaries",

Many applications in communications have adopted DL techniques due to their powerful representation ability. However, the learning-based methods can be dependent on the training dataset and perform worse on unseen interference due to limited model generalizability and complexity. In this paper, we consider the semantic communication (SemCom) system with multiple users, where there is a limited number of training samples and unexpected interference. To improve the model generalization ability and reduce the model size, we propose a knowledge distillation (KD) based system where Transformer based encoder-decoder is implemented as the semantic encoder-decoder and fully connected neural networks are implemented as the channel encoder-decoder. Specifically, four types of knowledge transfer and model compression are analyzed. Important system and model parameters are considered, including the level of noise and interference, the number of interfering users and the size of the encoder and decoder. Numerical results demonstrate that KD significantly improves the robustness and the generalization ability when applied to unexpected interference, and it reduces the performance loss when compressing the model size",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning hierarchical polynomials over the standard Gaussian distribution with three-layer neural networks. We specifically consider target functions of the form $h = g \\circ p$ where $p : \\mathbb{R}^d \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a degree $k$ polynomial and $g: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is a degree $q$ polynomial. This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\\widetilde \\Theta(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank. Our result also generalizes prior works on three-layer neural networks, which were restricted to the case of $p$ being a quadratic. When $p$ is indeed a quadratic, we achieve the information-theoretically optimal sample complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$, which is an improvement over prior work~\\citep{nichani2023provable} requiring a sample size of $\\widetilde\\Theta(d^4)$. Our proof proceeds by showing that during the initial stage of training the network performs feature learning to recover the feature $p$ with $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^k)$ samples. This work demonstrates the ability of three-layer neural networks to learn complex features and as a result, learn a broad class of hierarchical functions",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of spectral clustering under group fairness constraints, where samples from each sensitive group are approximately proportionally represented in each cluster. Traditional fair spectral clustering (FSC) methods consist of two consecutive stages, i.e., performing fair spectral embedding on a given graph and conducting $k$means to obtain discrete cluster labels. However, in practice, the graph is usually unknown, and we need to construct the underlying graph from potentially noisy data, the quality of which inevitably affects subsequent fair clustering performance. Furthermore, performing FSC through separate steps breaks the connections among these steps, leading to suboptimal results. To this end, we first theoretically analyze the effect of the constructed graph on FSC. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a novel graph construction method with a node-adaptive graph filter to learn graphs from noisy data. Then, all independent stages of conventional FSC are integrated into a single objective function, forming an end-to-end framework that inputs raw data and outputs discrete cluster labels. An algorithm is developed to jointly and alternately update the variables in each stage. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real data, which show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art fair clustering methods",

We leverage administrative data collected in deployment to design an online policy that maximizes expected outcomes while satisfying budget constraints, in the long run. Our proposed policy waitlists each individual for the resource maximizing the difference between their estimated mean treatment outcome and the estimated resource dual-price or, roughly, the opportunity cost of using the resource. Resources are then allocated as they arrive, in a first-come first-serve fashion. We demonstrate that our data-driven policy almost surely asymptotically achieves the expected outcome of the optimal out-of-sample policy under mild technical assumptions. We extend our framework to incorporate various fairness constraints. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the problem of designing policies for allocating scarce housing resources to people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles based on data from the homeless management information system. In particular, we show that using our policies improves rates of exit from homelessness by 1.9% and that policies that are fair in either allocation or outcomes by race come at a very low price of fairness",

An approach called Power Multiple Time Scale (PMTS) has been developed with outstanding regressing effect in multiple frequency ranges. Three models have been progressed based on PMTS NNs. PMTS could fit the brn=0 on the LM detectors with little errors both in time domain and frequency domain. The n>0 pick-up brn>0 generated by resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) can be obtained after subtracting the extracted brn=0. This new method uses only one LM instead of 4 LM detectors to extract brn=0. Therefore, the distribution of the LM detectors can also be optimized based on this new method",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a unified self-supervised pre-training framework for transferable multi-modal perception representation learning via masked multi-modal reconstruction in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), namely NeRF-Supervised Masked AutoEncoder (NS-MAE). Specifically, conditioned on certain view directions and locations, multi-modal embeddings extracted from corrupted multi-modal input signals, i.e., Lidar point clouds and images, are rendered into projected multi-modal feature maps via neural rendering. Then, original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered multi-modal feature maps to enable self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments show that the representation learned via NS-MAE shows promising transferability for diverse multi-modal and single-modal (camera-only and Lidar-only) perception models on diverse 3D perception downstream tasks (3D object detection and BEV map segmentation) with diverse amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Moreover, we empirically find that NS-MAE enjoys the synergy of both the mechanism of masked autoencoder and neural radiance field. Our code shall be released upon acceptance",

While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce \\textsc{FinMe}, a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making, encompassing three core modules: Profiling, to outline the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered processing, to aid the agent in assimilating realistic hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions.

Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare \\textsc{FinMe} with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks and funds.

Utilising publicly available data from StatsBomb, Bayesian hierarchical logistic regressions are constructed, analysing approximately 10,000 shots from the English Premier League to ascertain whether positional or player-level effects impact xG. The findings reveal positional effects in a basic model that includes only distance to goal and shot angle as predictors, highlighting that strikers and attacking midfielders exhibit a higher likelihood of scoring. However, these effects diminish when more informative predictors are introduced. Nevertheless, even with additional predictors, player-level effects persist, indicating that certain players possess notable positive or negative xG adjustments, influencing their likelihood of scoring a given chance. The study extends its analysis to data from Spain's La Liga and Germany's Bundesliga, yielding comparable results.

    "title": "Masked Conditional Diffusion Models for Image Analysis with Application to Radiographic Diagnosis of Infant Abuse",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The classic metaphyseal lesion (CML) is a distinct injury that is highly specific for infant abuse. It commonly occurs in the distal tibia. To aid radiologists detect these subtle fractures, we need to develop a model that can flag abnormal distal tibial radiographs (i.e. those with CMLs). Unfortunately, the development of such a model requires a large and diverse training database, which is often not available. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generative model for data augmentation. Unlike previous models that fail to generate data that span the diverse radiographic appearance of the distal tibial CML, our proposed masked conditional diffusion model (MaC-DM) not only generates realistic-appearing and wide-ranging synthetic images of the distal tibial radiographs with and without CMLs, it also generates their associated segmentation labels. To achieve these tasks, MaC-DM combines the weighted segmentation masks of the tibias and the CML fracture sites as additional conditions for classifier guidance. The augmented images from our model improved the performances of ResNet-34 in classifying normal radiographs and those with CMLs. Further, the augmented images and their associated segmentation masks enhanced the performance of the U-Net in labeling areas of the CMLs on distal tibial radiographs",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel clustered FL framework that enables distributed edge devices with non-IID data to independently form several clusters in a distributed manner and implement FL training within each cluster is proposed. In particular, our designed clustered FL algorithm must overcome two challenges associated with FL training. First, the server has limited FL training information (i.e., the parameter server can only obtain the FL model information of each device) and limited computational power for finding the differences among a large amount of devices. Second, each device does not have the data information of other devices for device clustering and can only use global FL model parameters received from the server and its data information to determine its cluster identity, which will increase the difficulty of device clustering. To overcome these two challenges, we propose a joint gradient and loss based distributed clustering method in which each device determines its cluster identity considering the gradient similarity and training loss. The proposed clustering method not only considers how a local FL model of one device contributes to each cluster but also the direction of gradient descent thus improving clustering speed. By delegating clustering decisions to edge devices, each device can fully leverage its private data information to determine its own cluster identity, thereby reducing clustering overhead and improving overall clustering performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed clustered FL algorithm can reduce clustering iterations by up to 99% compared to the existing baseline",

Our approach modifies the standard PC algorithm to bring performance on-par and exceeding that obtained from standard variational auto-encoder (VAE) training. By injecting Gaussian noise into the PC inference procedure we re-envision it as an overdamped Langevin sampling, which facilitates optimisation with respect to a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO). We improve the resultant encoder-free training method by incorporating an encoder network to provide an amortised warm-start to our Langevin sampling and test three different objectives for doing so. Finally, to increase robustness to the sampling step size and reduce sensitivity to curvature, we validate a lightweight and easily computable form of preconditioning, inspired by Riemann Manifold Langevin and adaptive optimizers from the SGD literature. We compare against VAEs by training like-for-like generative models using our technique against those trained with standard reparameterisation-trick-based ELBOs.

Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%.

    "abstract": "In-context prompting in large language models (LLMs) has become a prevalent approach to improve zero-shot capabilities, but this idea is less explored in the vision domain. Existing visual prompting methods focus on referring segmentation to segment the most relevant object, falling short of addressing many generic vision tasks like open-set segmentation and detection. In this paper, we introduce a universal visual in-context prompting framework for both tasks. In particular, we build on top of an encoder-decoder architecture, and develop a versatile prompt encoder to support a variety of prompts like strokes, boxes, and points. We further enhance it to take an arbitrary number of reference image segments as the context. Our extensive explorations show that the proposed visual in-context prompting elicits extraordinary referring and generic segmentation capabilities to refer and detect, yielding competitive performance to close-set in-domain datasets and showing promising results on many open-set segmentation datasets.

While recent work explores the combination of separate LoRAs to achieve joint generation of learned styles and subjects, existing techniques do not reliably address the problem; they often compromise either subject fidelity or style fidelity. We propose ZipLoRA, a method to cheaply and effectively merge independently trained style and subject LoRAs in order to achieve generation of any user-provided subject in any user-provided style. Experiments on a wide range of subject and style combinations show that ZipLoRA can generate compelling results with meaningful improvements over baselines in subject and style fidelity while preserving the ability to recontextualize.

This lower bound is in fact minimax optimal and is achieved by a natural quasi MLE. However, this estimator involves a search over all permutations which is computationally infeasible even when the problem has moderate size. To overcome this limitation, we show that the celebrated Gromov-Wasserstein algorithm from optimal transport which is more amenable to fast implementation even on large-scale problems is also minimax optimal.

In contrast to prior work, INVERT is capable of handling diverse types of neurons, exhibits less computational complexity, and does not rely on the availability of segmentation masks. Moreover, INVERT provides an interpretable metric assessing the alignment between the representation and its corresponding explanation and delivering a measure of statistical significance, emphasizing its utility and credibility.

To mitigate this prospect, we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment.

    "title": "Risk-sensitive Markov Decision Process and Learning under General Utility Functions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained substantial attention across diverse application domains and theoretical investigations. Existing literature on RL theory largely focuses on risk-neutral settings where the decision-maker learns to maximize the expected cumulative reward. However, in practical scenarios such as portfolio management and e-commerce recommendations, decision-makers often persist in heterogeneous risk preferences subject to outcome uncertainties, which can not be well-captured by the risk-neural framework. Incorporating these preferences can be approached through utility theory, yet the development of risk-sensitive RL under general utility functions remains an open question for theoretical exploration. In this paper, we consider a scenario where the decision-maker seeks to optimize a general utility function of the cumulative reward in the framework of a Markov decision process (MDP). To facilitate the Dynamic Programming Principle and Bellman equation, we enlarge the state space with an additional dimension that accounts for the cumulative reward. We propose a discretized approximation scheme to the MDP under enlarged state space, which is tractable and key for algorithmic design. We then propose a modified value iteration algorithm that employs an epsilon-covering over the space of cumulative reward. When a simulator is accessible, our algorithm efficiently learns a near-optimal policy with guaranteed sample complexity. In the absence of a simulator, our algorithm, designed with an upper-confidence-bound exploration approach, identifies a near-optimal policy while ensuring a guaranteed regret bound. For both algorithms, we match the theoretical lower bounds for the risk-neutral setting",

These results critically rely on high-quality scores to estimate the importance of an input to the network. We observe that there are two dominant strategies: static sampling, where the scores are determined before training, and dynamic sampling, where the scores can depend on the model weights. Static algorithms are computationally inexpensive but less effective than their dynamic counterparts, which can cause end-to-end slowdown due to their need to explicitly compute losses. To address this problem, we propose a novel sampling distribution based on nonparametric kernel regression that learns an effective importance score as the neural network trains. However, nonparametric regression models are too computationally expensive to accelerate end-to-end training. Therefore, we develop an efficient sketch-based approximation to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Using recent techniques from high-dimensional statistics and randomized algorithms, we prove that our Nadaraya-Watson sketch approximates the estimator with exponential convergence guarantees.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Linear principal component analysis (PCA), nonlinear PCA, and linear independent component analysis (ICA) -- those are three methods with single-layer autoencoder formulations for learning linear transformations from data. Linear PCA learns orthogonal transformations (rotations) that orient axes to maximise variance, but it suffers from a subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to find a unique rotation for axes that share the same variance. Both nonlinear PCA and linear ICA reduce the subspace indeterminacy from rotational to permutational by maximising statistical independence under the assumption of unit variance. The main difference between them is that nonlinear PCA only learns rotations while linear ICA learns not just rotations but any linear transformation with unit variance. The relationship between all three can be understood by the singular value decomposition of the linear ICA transformation into a sequence of rotation, scale, rotation. Linear PCA learns the first rotation; nonlinear PCA learns the second. The scale is simply the inverse of the standard deviations. The problem is that, in contrast to linear PCA, conventional nonlinear PCA cannot be used directly on the data to learn the first rotation, the first being special as it reduces dimensionality and orders by variances. In this paper, we have identified the cause, and as a solution we propose $\\sigma$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear PCA as single-layer autoencoders. One of its key ingredients: modelling not just the rotation but also the scale -- the variances. This model bridges the disparity between linear and nonlinear PCA. And so, like linear PCA, it can learn a semi-orthogonal transformation that reduces dimensionality and orders by variances, but, unlike linear PCA, it does not suffer from rotational indeterminacy",

We show how generalized trace-induced quantum kernels can be constructed as combinations of the fundamental building blocks we coin \"Lego\" kernels, which impose an inductive bias on the resulting quantum models. We relate the expressive power and generalization ability to the number of non-zero weight Lego kernels and propose a systematic approach to increase the complexity of a quantum kernel model, leading to a new form of the local projected kernels that require fewer quantum resources in terms of the number of quantum gates and measurement shots.

We focus on the setting in which the target distribution is only accessible through a set of $n$ i.i.d. observations, and the integrand belongs to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We propose an efficient procedure which exploits a small i.i.d. random subset of $m<n$ samples drawn either uniformly or using approximate leverage scores from the initial observations. Our main result is an upper bound on the approximation error of this procedure for both sampling strategies. It yields sufficient conditions on the subsample size to recover the standard (optimal) $n^{-1/2}$ rate while reducing drastically the number of functions evaluations, and thus the overall computational cost. Moreover, we obtain rates with respect to the number $m$ of evaluations of the integrand which adapt to its smoothness, and match known optimal rates for instance for Sobolev spaces. We illustrate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on real datasets, which highlight the attractive efficiency-accuracy tradeoff of our method compared to existing randomized and greedy quadrature methods. We note that, the problem of numerical integration in RKHS amounts to designing a discrete approximation of the kernel mean embedding of the target distribution.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved remarkable results in a wide range of applications. However, their scalability is hampered by the quadratic time and memory complexity of the self-attention mechanism concerning the sequence length. This limitation poses a substantial obstacle when dealing with long documents or high-resolution images. In this work, we study the self-attention mechanism by analyzing the distribution of the attention matrix and its concentration ability. Furthermore, we propose instruments to measure these quantities and introduce a novel self-attention mechanism, Linear Log-Normal Attention, designed to emulate the distribution and concentration behavior of the original self-attention. Our experimental results on popular natural language benchmarks reveal that our proposed Linear Log-Normal Attention outperforms other linearized attention alternatives, offering a promising avenue for enhancing the scalability of transformer models.

    "title": "Learned Nonlinear Predictor for Critically Sampled 3D Point Cloud Attribute Compression",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study 3D point cloud attribute compression via a volumetric approach: assuming point cloud geometry is known at both encoder and decoder, parameters $\\theta$ of a continuous attribute function $f: \\mathbb{R}^3 \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}$ are quantized to $\\hat{\\theta}$ and encoded, so that discrete samples $f_{\\hat{\\theta}}(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ can be recovered at known 3D points $\\mathbf{x}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ at the decoder. Specifically, we consider a nested sequences of function subspaces $\\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_{l_0} \\subseteq \\cdots \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}^{(p)}_L$, where $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ is a family of functions spanned by B-spline basis functions of order $p$, $f_l^*$ is the projection of $f$ on $\\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)}$ and encoded as low-pass coefficients $F_l^*$, and $g_l^*$ is the residual function in orthogonal subspace $\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)}$ (where $\\mathcal{G}_l^{(p)} \\oplus \\mathcal{F}_l^{(p)} = \\mathcal{F}_{l+1}^{(p)}$) and encoded as high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$. In this paper, to improve coding performance over [1], we study predicting $f_{l+1}^*$ at level $l+1$ given $f_l^*$ at level $l$ and encoding of $G_l^*$ for the $p=1$ case (RAHT($1$)). For the prediction, we formalize RAHT(1) linear prediction in MPEG-PCC in a theoretical framework, and propose a new nonlinear predictor using a polynomial of bilateral filter. We derive equations to efficiently compute the critically sampled high-pass coefficients $G_l^*$ amenable to encoding. We optimize parameters in our resulting feed-forward network on a large training set of point clouds by minimizing a rate-distortion Lagrangian. Experimental results show that our improved framework outperformed the MPEG G-PCC predictor by $11$ to $12\\%$ in bit rate reduction",

    "title": "Speak Like a Native: Prompting Large Language Models in a Native Style",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing work has found that the prompt engineering heavily influences the performance of large language models (LLMs). Chain-of-thought (CoT), as a popular prompt engineering technique, prompted LLMs using in-context examples with reasoning steps. In current studies, the few-shot examples of CoT are generally handcrafted by humans. However, how the text style of in-context examples influence the outputs of LLMs still remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel and effective approach, named \\textbf{AlignCoT}, to improve the reasoning capability of LLMs by aligning the in-context examples with the native style of LLMs. ``Native'' refers to the inherent characteristic style of LLMs which can be probed by original zero-shot scenarios. AlignCoT is orthogonal to other prompt engineering methods, making it easy to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve the LLMs' performance. We conduct extensive and comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks. The empirical results demonstrate that our AlignCoTsignificantly improves performance over the carefully handcrafted in-context examples. For instance, with GPT-3.5-turbo, we observed a +2.5\\% improvement on GSM8K. Furthermore, our AlignCoT consistently improve the performance when combined with other state-of-the-art prompt engineering methods.

    "abstract": "Natural disasters act as a serious threat globally, requiring effective and efficient disaster management and recovery. This paper focuses on classifying natural disaster images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Multiple CNN architectures were built and trained on a dataset containing images of earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and volcanoes. A stacked CNN ensemble approach proved to be the most effective, achieving 95% accuracy and an F1 score going up to 0.96 for individual classes. Tuning hyperparameters of individual models for optimization was critical to maximize the models' performance. The stacking of CNNs with XGBoost acting as the meta-model utilizes the strengths of the CNN and ResNet models to improve the overall accuracy of the classification. Results obtained from the models illustrated the potency of CNN-based models for automated disaster image classification. This lays the foundation for expanding these techniques to build robust systems for disaster response, damage assessment, and recovery management",

    "abstract": "Language models for code such as CodeBERT offer the capability to learn advanced source code representation, but their opacity poses barriers to understanding of captured properties. Recent attention analysis studies provide initial interpretability insights by focusing solely on attention weights rather than considering the wider context modeling of Transformers. This study aims to shed some light on the previously ignored factors of the attention mechanism beyond the attention weights. We conduct an initial empirical study analyzing both attention distributions and transformed representations in CodeBERT. Across two programming languages, Java and Python, we find that the scaled transformation norms of the input better capture syntactic structure compared to attention weights alone. Our analysis reveals characterization of how CodeBERT embeds syntactic code properties. The findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating factors beyond just attention weights for rigorously understanding neural code models.

    "abstract": "Motor impairments, frequently caused by neurological incidents like strokes or traumatic brain injuries, present substantial obstacles in rehabilitation therapy. This research aims to elevate the field by optimizing motor imagery classification algorithms within Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). By improving the efficiency of BCIs, we offer a novel approach that holds significant promise for enhancing motor rehabilitation outcomes. Utilizing unsupervised techniques for dimensionality reduction, namely Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) coupled with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we evaluate the necessity of employing supervised methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification tasks. Importantly, participants who exhibited high KNN scores following UMAP dimensionality reduction also achieved high accuracy in supervised deep learning (DL) models. Due to individualized model requirements and massive neural training data, dimensionality reduction becomes an effective preprocessing step that minimizes the need for extensive data labeling and supervised deep learning techniques. This approach has significant implications not only for targeted therapies in motor dysfunction but also for addressing regulatory, safety, and reliability concerns in the rapidly evolving BCI field",

    "title": "Bitformer: An efficient Transformer with bitwise operation-based attention for Big Data Analytics at low-cost low-precision devices",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the current landscape of large models, the Transformer stands as a cornerstone, playing a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of modern models. However, its application encounters challenges attributed to the substantial computational intricacies intrinsic to its attention mechanism. Moreover, its reliance on high-precision floating-point operations presents specific hurdles, particularly evident in computation-intensive scenarios such as edge computing environments. These environments, characterized by resource-constrained devices and a preference for lower precision, necessitate innovative solutions. To tackle the exacting data processing demands posed by edge devices, we introduce the Bitformer model, an inventive extension of the Transformer paradigm. Central to this innovation is a novel attention mechanism that adeptly replaces conventional floating-point matrix multiplication with bitwise operations. This strategic substitution yields dual advantages. Not only does it maintain the attention mechanism's prowess in capturing intricate long-range information dependencies, but it also orchestrates a profound reduction in the computational complexity inherent in the attention operation. The transition from an $O(n^2d)$ complexity, typical of floating-point operations, to an $O(n^2T)$ complexity characterizing bitwise operations, substantiates this advantage. Notably, in this context, the parameter $T$ remains markedly smaller than the conventional dimensionality parameter $d$. The Bitformer model in essence endeavors to reconcile the indomitable requirements of modern computing landscapes with the constraints posed by edge computing scenarios. By forging this innovative path, we bridge the gap between high-performing models and resource-scarce environments, thus unveiling a promising trajectory for further advancements in the field",

Written records often reflect bias, and once bias is identified; it is possible to refer individuals for training to reduce bias. Many machine learning tools exist to explore text data and create predictive models that can search written records to identify real-time bias. However, few previous studies investigate large language model embeddings and geometric models of biased text data to understand geometry's impact on bias modeling accuracy. To overcome this issue, this study utilizes the RedditBias database to analyze textual biases. Four transformer models, including BERT and RoBERTa variants, were explored. Post-embedding, t-SNE allowed two-dimensional visualization of data. KNN classifiers differentiated bias types, with lower k-values proving more effective. Findings suggest BERT, particularly mini BERT, excels in bias classification, while multilingual models lag.

We show that PINNs can accurately and effectively solve the Grad-Shafranov equation with several different boundary conditions. We also explore the parameter space by varying the size of the model, the learning rate, and boundary conditions to map various trade-offs such as between reconstruction error and computational speed. Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic and radiotherapy (RT) planning tool, offering detailed insights into the anatomy of the human body. The extensive scan time is stressful for patients, who must remain motionless in a prolonged imaging procedure that prioritizes reduction of imaging artifacts. This is challenging for pediatric patients who may require measures for managing voluntary motions such as anesthesia. Several computational approaches reduce scan time (fast MRI), by recording fewer measurements and digitally recovering full information via post-acquisition reconstruction. However, most fast MRI approaches were developed for diagnostic imaging, without addressing reconstruction challenges specific to RT planning. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based method (DeepMRIRec) for MRI reconstruction from undersampled data acquired with RT-specific receiver coil arrangements. We evaluated our method against fully sampled data of T1-weighted MR images acquired from 73 children with brain tumors/surgical beds using loop and posterior coils (12 channels), with and without applying virtual compression of coil elements. DeepMRIRec reduced scanning time by a factor of four producing a structural similarity score surpassing the evaluated state-of-the-art method (0.960 vs 0.896), thereby demonstrating its potential for accelerating MRI scanning for RT planning",

    "title": "Machine Translation to Control Formality Features in the Target Language",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Formality plays a significant role in language communication, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages utilise formal and informal expressions to convey messages based on social contexts and relationships. When a language translation technique is used to translate from a source language that does not pertain the formality (e.g. English) to a target language that does, there is a missing information on formality that could be a challenge in producing an accurate outcome. This research explores how this issue should be resolved when machine learning methods are used to translate from English to languages with formality, using Hindi as the example data. This was done by training a bilingual model in a formality-controlled setting and comparing its performance with a pre-trained multilingual model in a similar setting. Since there are not a lot of training data with ground truth, automated annotation techniques were employed to increase the data size. The primary modeling approach involved leveraging transformer models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the official formality accuracy(ACC) by comparing the predicted masked tokens with the ground truth. This metric provides a quantitative measure of how well the translations align with the desired outputs. Our study showcases a versatile translation strategy that considers the nuances of formality in the target language, catering to diverse language communication needs and scenarios",

However, such coarse-grained representations discard essential information for modeling molecular interactions and impair the quality of generated structures. In this work, we present a novel GNN-based architecture for learning latent representations of molecular structure.

However, in a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, identifying the whole Pareto front requires the prohibitive search cost, while in many practical scenarios, the decision maker (DM) only needs a specific solution among the set of the Pareto optimal solutions. We propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to identifying the most preferred solution in the MOO with expensive objective functions, in which a Bayesian preference model of the DM is adaptively estimated by an interactive manner based on the two types of supervisions called the pairwise preference and improvement request. To explore the most preferred solution, we define an acquisition function in which the uncertainty both in the objective functions and the DM preference is incorporated. Further, to minimize the interaction cost with the DM, we also propose an active learning strategy for the preference estimation.

In this work, we introduce three different parameterizations of finite discrete TEMs via Legendre functions of the negative tempered entropy function. In particular, we establish an isometry between such parameterizations in terms of a generalization of the Hilbert log cross-ratio simplex distance to a tempered Hilbert co-simplex distance. Similar to the Hilbert geometry, the tempered Hilbert distance is characterized as a $t$-symmetrization of the oriented tempered Funk distance. We motivate our construction by introducing the notion of $t$-lengths of smooth curves in a tautological Finsler manifold.

Specifically, we study this problem under the constraint of $\\rho$ zero-concentrated differential privacy (zCDP). When $\\kappa\\in[1,2]$ and the loss function is Lipschitz and smooth over a sufficiently large region, we provide a new algorithm based on variance reduced gradient descent that achieves the rate $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^\\kappa\\big)$ on the excess empirical risk, where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension.

Specifically, we show that this algorithm can approximate stationary points of Lipschitz, smooth (and possibly nonconvex) objectives with rate as fast as $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)$ and never worse than $\\tilde{O}\\big(\\big(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\sqrt{\\rho}}\\big)^{1/2}\\big)$. The latter rate matches the best known rate for methods that do not rely on variance reduction",

    "title": "Transfer Attacks and Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Tasks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as code2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, such as the inclusion of \"dead code\" through false conditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to \"fool\" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of adversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code models, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such adversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based defenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information such as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for reversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial examples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening the LLMs' performance. The proposed defenses show promise in improving the model's resilience, paving the way to more robust defensive solutions for LLMs in code-related applications",

It remains an open question whether classifier-free guidance can be performed for Flow Matching models, and to what extent does it improve performance. In this paper, we explore the usage of Guided Flows for a variety of downstream applications involving conditional image generation, speech synthesis, and reinforcement learning. In particular, we are the first to apply flow models to the offline reinforcement learning setting. We also show that Guided Flows significantly improves the sample quality in image generation and zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis, and can make use of drastically low amounts of computation without affecting the agent's overall performance",

In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strain histories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source task and cyclic loading conditions as the target task. Incorporating sub-scale properties enhances RNN versatility.

    "abstract": "The gameplay of strategic board games such as chess, Go and Hex is often characterized by combinatorial, relational structures -- capturing distinct interactions and non-local patterns -- and not just images. Nonetheless, most common self-play reinforcement learning (RL) approaches simply approximate policy and value functions using convolutional neural networks (CNN). A key feature of CNNs is their relational inductive bias towards locality and translational invariance. In contrast, graph neural networks (GNN) can encode more complicated and distinct relational structures. Hence, we investigate the crucial question: Can GNNs, with their ability to encode complex connections, replace CNNs in self-play reinforcement learning? To this end, we do a comparison with Hex -- an abstract yet strategically rich board game -- serving as our experimental platform. Our findings reveal that GNNs excel at dealing with long range dependency situations in game states and are less prone to overfitting, but also showing a reduced proficiency in discerning local patterns. This suggests a potential paradigm shift, signaling the use of game-specific structures to reshape self-play reinforcement learning",

This study conducts a comprehensive empirical evaluation of using uncertainty values as substitutes for error rates in detecting drifts, aiming to alleviate the reliance on labeled post-deployment data. We examine five uncertainty estimation methods in conjunction with the ADWIN detector across seven real-world datasets. Our results reveal that while the SWAG method exhibits superior calibration, the overall accuracy in detecting drifts is not notably impacted by the choice of uncertainty estimation method, with even the most basic method demonstrating competitive performance.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Classifying patterns of known classes and rejecting ambiguous and novel (also called as out-of-distribution (OOD)) inputs are involved in open world pattern recognition. Deep neural network models usually excel in closed-set classification while performing poorly in rejecting OOD. To tackle this problem, numerous methods have been designed to perform open set recognition (OSR) or OOD rejection/detection tasks. Previous methods mostly take post-training score transformation or hybrid models to ensure low scores on OOD inputs while separating known classes. In this paper, we attempt to build a unified framework for building open set classifiers for both classification and OOD rejection. We formulate the open set recognition of $ K $-known-class as a $ (K + 1) $-class classification problem with model trained on known-class samples only. By decomposing the $ K $-class problem into $ K $ one-versus-all (OVA) binary classification tasks and binding some parameters, we show that combining the scores of OVA classifiers can give $ (K + 1) $-class posterior probabilities, which enables classification and OOD rejection in a unified framework. To maintain the closed-set classification accuracy of the OVA trained classifier, we propose a hybrid training strategy combining OVA loss and multi-class cross-entropy loss. We implement the OVA framework and hybrid training strategy on the recently proposed convolutional prototype network. Experiments on popular OSR and OOD detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework, using a single multi-class classifier, yields competitive performance in closed-set classification, OOD detection, and misclassification detection",

State-of-the-art machine learning pipelines generate resource-agnostic models, not capable to adapt at runtime. In this work we introduce Resource-Efficient Deep Subnetworks (REDS) to tackle model adaptation to variable resources. In contrast to the state-of-the-art, REDS use structured sparsity constructively by exploiting permutation invariance of neurons, which allows for hardware-specific optimizations. Specifically, REDS achieve computational efficiency by (1) skipping sequential computational blocks identified by a novel iterative knapsack optimizer, and (2) leveraging simple math to re-arrange the order of operations in REDS computational graph to take advantage of the data cache. REDS support conventional deep networks frequently deployed on the edge and provide computational benefits even for small and simple networks. We evaluate REDS on six benchmark architectures trained on the Google Speech Commands, FMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, and test on four off-the-shelf mobile and embedded hardware platforms. We provide a theoretical result and empirical evidence for REDS outstanding performance in terms of submodels' test set accuracy, and demonstrate an adaptation time in response to dynamic resource constraints of under 40$\\mu$s, utilizing a 2-layer fully-connected network on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular technique for edge AI to mine valuable knowledge in edge computing (EC) systems. To mitigate the computing/communication burden on resource-constrained workers and protect model privacy, split federated learning (SFL) has been released by integrating both data and model parallelism. Despite resource limitations, SFL still faces two other critical challenges in EC, i.e., statistical heterogeneity and system heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SFL framework, termed MergeSFL, by incorporating feature merging and batch size regulation in SFL. Concretely, feature merging aims to merge the features from workers into a mixed feature sequence, which is approximately equivalent to the features derived from IID data and is employed to promote model accuracy. While batch size regulation aims to assign diverse and suitable batch sizes for heterogeneous workers to improve training efficiency. Moreover, MergeSFL explores to jointly optimize these two strategies upon their coupled relationship to better enhance the performance of SFL. Extensive experiments are conducted on a physical platform with 80 NVIDIA Jetson edge devices, and the experimental results show that MergeSFL can improve the final model accuracy by 5.82% to 26.22%, with a speedup by about 1.74x to 4.14x, compared to the baselines",

We call it learning principle, and it follows that all learning is equivalent to estimating the probability of input data. We not only derived this principle, but also mentioned its application to actual machine learning models. For example, we found that conventional supervised learning is equivalent to estimating conditional probabilities, and succeeded in making supervised learning more effective and generalized. We also proposed a new method of defining the values of estimated probability using differentiation, and showed that unsupervised learning can be performed on arbitrary dataset without any prior knowledge. Namely, this method is a general-purpose machine learning in the true sense. Moreover, we succeeded in describing the learning mechanism in the brain by considering the time evolution of a fully or partially connected model and applying this new method.

Still, precise segmentation is difficult due to the complexity of vascular structures, anatomical variations across patients, the scarcity of annotated public datasets, and the quality of images. We present a thorough literature review, highlighting the state of machine learning techniques across diverse organs. Our goal is to provide a foundation on the topic and identify a robust baseline model for application to vascular segmentation in a new imaging modality, Hierarchical Phase Contrast Tomography (HiP CT). Introduced in 2020 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, HiP CT enables 3D imaging of complete organs at an unprecedented resolution of ca. 20mm per voxel, with the capability for localized zooms in selected regions down to 1mm per voxel without sectioning. We have created a training dataset with double annotator validated vascular data from three kidneys imaged with HiP CT in the context of the Human Organ Atlas Project. Finally, utilising the nnU Net model, we conduct experiments to assess the models performance on both familiar and unseen samples, employing vessel specific metrics. Our results show that while segmentations yielded reasonably high scores such as clDice values ranging from 0.82 to 0.88, certain errors persisted. Large vessels that collapsed due to the lack of hydrostatic pressure (HiP CT is an ex vivo technique) were segmented poorly. Moreover, decreased connectivity in finer vessels and higher segmentation errors at vessel boundaries were observed. Such errors obstruct the understanding of the structures by interrupting vascular tree connectivity. Through our review and outputs, we aim to set a benchmark for subsequent model evaluations using various modalities, especially with the HiP CT imaging database",

The core object of study is the probability of each state-action pair being visited under the optimal policy. Previous approaches to approximate this quantity can be arbitrarily poor, leading to algorithms that do not implement genuine statistical inference and consequently do not perform well in challenging problems. In this work, we undertake a rigorous Bayesian treatment of the posterior probability of state-action optimality and clarify how it flows through the MDP. We first reveal that this quantity can indeed be used to generate a policy that explores efficiently, as measured by regret. Unfortunately, computing it is intractable, so we derive a new variational Bayesian approximation yielding a tractable convex optimization problem and establish that the resulting policy also explores efficiently. We call our approach VAPOR and show that it has strong connections to Thompson sampling, K-learning, and maximum entropy exploration.

    "abstract": "Hydropower plants are crucial for stable renewable energy and serve as vital water sources for sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation. This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts",

Moreover, we found variable classification performances between subjects due to differences in the physical structure of their hearts. Various techniques were used to minimize this variability. First of all, normalization proved to be a crucial step and significantly improved the performance. Secondly, grouping subjects and performing classification inside a group helped to improve performance and decrease inter-subject variability. Finally, we show that including handcrafted features as input to a deep learning (DL) network improves the classification performance further. Together, these findings indicate that heart rate time series can be utilized for classification tasks like predicting activity. However, normalization or grouping techniques need to be chosen carefully to minimize the issue of subject variability",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) attack has emerged as a prevalent and highly effective method for extracting sensitive training data by inspecting exchanged gradients. This approach poses a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals and organizations alike. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the gradient leakage method when applied specifically to transformer-based models. Through meticulous examination, we showcase the capability to accurately recover data solely from gradients and rigorously investigate the conditions under which gradient attacks can be executed, providing compelling evidence. Furthermore, we reevaluate the approach of introducing additional noise on gradients as a protective measure against gradient attacks. To address this, we outline a theoretical proof that analyzes the associated privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Additionally, we affirm the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm under perturbed gradients. The primary objective of this study is to augment the understanding of gradient leakage attack and defense strategies while actively contributing to the development of privacy-preserving techniques specifically tailored for transformer-based models. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with gradient leakage, this research aims to foster advancements in safeguarding sensitive data and upholding privacy in the context of transformer-based models",

These factors, which take up a large proportion of training time, make data management in GNN training more significant. This paper reviews GNN training from a data management perspective and provides a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the representative approaches.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative method for training models while preserving data privacy in decentralized settings. However, FL encounters challenges related to data heterogeneity, which can result in performance degradation. In our study, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, feature representation in the FedAVG model deteriorates more significantly compared to classifier weight. Additionally, we observe that as data heterogeneity increases, the gap between higher feature norms for observed classes, obtained from local models, and feature norms of unobserved classes widens, in contrast to the behavior of classifier weight norms. This widening gap extends to encompass the feature norm disparities between local and the global models. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Averaging with Feature Normalization Update (FedFN), a straightforward learning method. We demonstrate the superior performance of FedFN through extensive experiments, even when applied to pretrained ResNet18. Subsequently, we confirm the applicability of FedFN to foundation models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the field of equation learning, exhaustively considering all possible equations derived from a basis function dictionary is infeasible. Sparse regression and greedy algorithms have emerged as popular approaches to tackle this challenge. However, the presence of multicollinearity poses difficulties for sparse regression techniques, and greedy steps may inadvertently exclude terms of the true equation, leading to reduced identification accuracy. In this article, we present an approach that strikes a balance between comprehensiveness and efficiency in equation learning. Inspired by stepwise regression, our approach combines the coefficient of determination, $R^2$, and the Bayesian model evidence, $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$, in a novel way. Our procedure is characterized by a comprehensive search with just a minor reduction of the model space at each iteration step. With two flavors of our approach and the adoption of $p(\\boldsymbol y|\\mathcal M)$ for bi-directional stepwise regression, we present a total of three new avenues for equation learning. Through three extensive numerical experiments involving random polynomials and dynamical systems, we compare our approach against four state-of-the-art methods and two standard approaches. The results demonstrate that our comprehensive search approach surpasses all other methods in terms of identification accuracy. In particular, the second flavor of our approach establishes an efficient overfitting penalty solely based on $R^2$, which achieves highest rates of exact equation recovery",

    "abstract": "Digital pathology enables automatic analysis of histopathological sections using artificial intelligence (AI). Automatic evaluation could improve diagnostic efficiency and help find associations between morphological features and clinical outcome. For development of such prediction models, identifying invasive epithelial cells, and separating these from benign epithelial cells and in situ lesions would be the first step. In this study, we aimed to develop an AI model for segmentation of epithelial cells in sections from breast cancer. We generated epithelial ground truth masks by restaining hematoxylin and eosin (HE) sections with cytokeratin (CK) AE1/AE3, and by pathologists' annotations. HE/CK image pairs were used to train a convolutional neural network, and data augmentation was used to make the model more robust. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 839 patients, and whole slide images from two patients were used for training and evaluation of the models. The sections were derived from four cohorts of breast cancer patients. TMAs from 21 patients from a fifth cohort was used as a second test set. In quantitative evaluation, a mean Dice score of 0.70, 0.79, and 0.75 for invasive epithelial cells, benign epithelial cells, and in situ lesions, respectively, were achieved. In qualitative scoring (0-5) by pathologists, results were best for all epithelium and invasive epithelium, with scores of 4.7 and 4.4. Scores for benign epithelium and in situ lesions were 3.7 and 2.0. The proposed model segmented epithelial cells in HE stained breast cancer slides well, but further work is needed for accurate division between the classes. Immunohistochemistry, together with pathologists' annotations, enabled the creation of accurate ground truths.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited performance in structural knowledge extraction, such as relations between objects. In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenges of online Continual Learning (CL) by introducing a density distribution-based learning framework. CL, especially the Class Incremental Learning, enables adaptation to new test distributions while continuously learning from a single-pass training data stream, which is more in line with the practical application requirements of real-world scenarios. However, existing CL methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and higher computing costs due to complex algorithm designs, limiting their practical use. Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by achieving superior average accuracy and time-space efficiency, bridging the performance gap between CL and classical machine learning. Specifically, we adopt an independent Generative Kernel Density Estimation (GKDE) model for each CL task. During the testing stage, the GKDEs utilize a self-reported max probability density value to determine which one is responsible for predicting incoming test instances. A GKDE-based learning objective can ensure that samples with the same label are grouped together, while dissimilar instances are pushed farther apart. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple CL datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our method outperforms popular CL approaches by a significant margin, while maintaining competitive time-space efficiency, making our framework suitable for real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables joint training across distributed clients using their local data privately. Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) builds on FL to handle multiple tasks, assuming model congruity that identical model architecture is deployed in each client. To relax this assumption and thus extend real-world applicability, we introduce a novel problem setting, Hetero-Client Federated Multi-Task Learning (HC-FMTL), to accommodate diverse task setups. The main challenge of HC-FMTL is the model incongruity issue that invalidates conventional aggregation methods. It also escalates the difficulties in accurate model aggregation to deal with data and task heterogeneity inherent in FMTL. To address these challenges, we propose the FedHCA$^2$ framework, which allows for federated training of personalized models by modeling relationships among heterogeneous clients. Drawing on our theoretical insights into the difference between multi-task and federated optimization, we propose the Hyper Conflict-Averse Aggregation scheme to mitigate conflicts during encoder updates. Additionally, inspired by task interaction in MTL, the Hyper Cross Attention Aggregation scheme uses layer-wise cross attention to enhance decoder interactions while alleviating model incongruity. Moreover, we employ learnable Hyper Aggregation Weights for each client to customize personalized parameter updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FedHCA$^2$ in various HC-FMTL scenarios compared to representative methods. Our code will be made publicly available",

Our attack is based on an existing edge perturbation attack, from which we restrict the optimization process to formulate a node injection attack.

    "title": "Using Human Feedback to Fine-tune Diffusion Models without Any Reward Model",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) has shown significant promise in fine-tuning diffusion models. Previous methods start by training a reward model that aligns with human preferences, then leverage RL techniques to fine-tune the underlying models. However, crafting an efficient reward model demands extensive datasets, optimal architecture, and manual hyperparameter tuning, making the process both time and cost-intensive. The direct preference optimization (DPO) method, effective in fine-tuning large language models, eliminates the necessity for a reward model. However, the extensive GPU memory requirement of the diffusion model's denoising process hinders the direct application of the DPO method. To address this issue, we introduce the Direct Preference for Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (D3PO) method to directly fine-tune diffusion models. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that although D3PO omits training a reward model, it effectively functions as the optimal reward model trained using human feedback data to guide the learning process. This approach requires no training of a reward model, proving to be more direct, cost-effective, and minimizing computational overhead. In experiments, our method uses the relative scale of objectives as a proxy for human preference, delivering comparable results to methods using ground-truth rewards. Moreover, D3PO demonstrates the ability to reduce image distortion rates and generate safer images, overcoming challenges lacking robust reward models",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in various applications. Existing frameworks utilize CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments to train GNN models and integrate mini-batch and sampling techniques to overcome the GPU memory limitation. In CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments, we can divide sample-based GNN training into three steps: sample, gather, and train. Existing GNN systems use different task orchestrating methods to employ each step on CPU or GPU. After extensive experiments and analysis, we find that existing task orchestrating methods fail to fully utilize the heterogeneous resources, limited by inefficient CPU processing or GPU resource contention. In this paper, we propose NeutronOrch, a system for sample-based GNN training that incorporates a layer-based task orchestrating method and ensures balanced utilization of the CPU and GPU. NeutronOrch decouples the training process by layer and pushes down the training task of the bottom layer to the CPU. This significantly reduces the computational load and memory footprint of GPU training. To avoid inefficient CPU processing, NeutronOrch only offloads the training of frequently accessed vertices to the CPU and lets GPU reuse their embeddings with bounded staleness. Furthermore, NeutronOrch provides a fine-grained pipeline design for the layer-based task orchestrating method, fully overlapping different tasks on heterogeneous resources while strictly guaranteeing bounded staleness. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GNN systems, NeutronOrch can achieve up to 4.61x performance speedup",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR), a promising method that uses information from multiple domains (more than three) to generate accurate and diverse recommendations, and takes into account the sequential nature of user interactions. The effectiveness of these systems often depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially low relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance at the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show that our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two real-world datasets across ten different domains",

    "abstract": "Algorithm selection aims to identify the most suitable algorithm for solving a specific problem before execution, which has become a critical process of the AutoML. Current mainstream algorithm selection techniques rely heavily on feature representations of various problems and employ the performance of each algorithm as supervised information. However, there is a significant research gap concerning the consideration of algorithm features. This gap is primarily attributed to the inherent complexity of algorithms, making it particularly challenging to find a universally effective feature extraction method that is applicable across a diverse range of algorithms. Unfortunately, neglecting this aspect undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of algorithm selection and indirectly necessitates an increased volume of problem data for training purposes. This paper takes a significant stride towards addressing this gap by proposing an approach that integrates algorithm representation into the algorithm selection process. Specifically, our proposed model employs distinct modules to extract representations of both problems and algorithms, where the algorithm representation leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in the realm of code comprehension. Following the extraction of embedding vectors for both algorithms and problems, the most suitable algorithm is determined through calculations of matching degrees. Our experiments not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also showcase the performance of different embedded pre-trained LLMs, which suggests that the proposed algorithm selection framework holds the potential to serve as a baseline task for evaluating the code representation capabilities of LLMs",

In specific, each batch collects data according to a policy that depends on previous batches and the rewards are revealed only at the end of the batch. Such a feedback structure is popular in applications such as personalized medicine and online advertisement, where the online data often do not arrive in a fully serial manner. We consider high-dimensional and linear settings where the reward function of the bandit model admits either a sparse or low-rank structure and ask how small a number of batches are needed for a comparable performance with fully dynamic data in which $L = T$. For these settings, we design a provably sample-efficient algorithm which achieves a $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(s_0^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the sparse case and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O} ( r ^2 \\log^2 T)$ regret in the low-rank case, using only $L = \\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches. Here $s_0$ and $r$ are the sparsity and rank of the reward parameter in sparse and low-rank cases, respectively, and $ \\mathcal{\\tilde O}(\\cdot)$ omits logarithmic factors involving the feature dimensions. In other words, our algorithm achieves regret bounds comparable to those in fully sequential setting with only $\\mathcal{O}( \\log T)$ batches.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create \"expert\" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

On the other hand, zero-shot NAS utilizes training-free proxies to evaluate a candidate architecture's test performance but has two limitations: (1) inability to use the information gained as a network improves with training and (2) unreliable performance, particularly in complex domains like RecSys, due to the multi-modal data inputs and complex architecture configurations. To synthesize the benefits of both methods, we introduce a \"sub-one-shot\" paradigm that serves as a bridge between zero-shot and one-shot NAS. In sub-one-shot NAS, the supernet is trained using only a small subset of the training data, a phase we refer to as \"warm-up.\" Within this framework, we present SiGeo, a proxy founded on a novel theoretical framework that connects the supernet warm-up with the efficacy of the proxy. Extensive experiments have shown that SiGeo, with the benefit of warm-up, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NAS proxies on various established NAS benchmarks. When a supernet is warmed up, it can achieve comparable performance to weight-sharing one-shot NAS methods, but with a significant reduction ($\\sim 60$\\%) in computational costs",

    "abstract": "Although Federated Learning (FL) is promising to enable collaborative learning among Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices, it suffers from the problem of low classification performance due to various heterogeneity factors (e.g., computing capacity, memory size) of devices and uncertain operating environments. To address these issues, this paper introduces an effective FL approach named AdaptiveFL based on a novel fine-grained width-wise model pruning strategy, which can generate various heterogeneous local models for heterogeneous AIoT devices. By using our proposed reinforcement learning-based device selection mechanism, AdaptiveFL can adaptively dispatch suitable heterogeneous models to corresponding AIoT devices on the fly based on their available resources for local training. Experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, AdaptiveFL can achieve up to 16.83% inference improvements for both IID and non-IID scenarios",

By dynamically dispatching different model portions to AIoT devices according to their computing capability, S$^2$FL can alleviate the low training efficiency caused by stragglers. By combining features uploaded by devices with different data distributions to generate multiple larger batches with a uniform distribution for back-propagation, S$^2$FL can alleviate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity.

    "abstract": "We investigate the statistical task of closeness (or equivalence) testing for multidimensional distributions. Specifically, given sample access to two unknown distributions $\\mathbf p, \\mathbf q$ on $\\mathbb R^d$, we want to distinguish between the case that $\\mathbf p=\\mathbf q$ versus $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k} > \\epsilon$, where $\\|\\mathbf p-\\mathbf q\\|_{A_k}$ denotes the generalized ${A}_k$ distance between $\\mathbf p$ and $\\mathbf q$ -- measuring the maximum discrepancy between the distributions over any collection of $k$ disjoint, axis-aligned rectangles. Our main result is the first closeness tester for this problem with {\\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. In more detail, we provide a computationally efficient closeness tester with sample complexity $O\\left((k^{6/7}/ \\mathrm{poly}_d(\\epsilon)) \\log^d(k)\\right)$. On the lower bound side, we establish a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(k^{6/7}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$, even for $d=2$. These sample complexity bounds are surprising because the sample complexity of the problem in the univariate setting is $\\Theta(k^{4/5}/\\mathrm{poly}(\\epsilon))$. This has the interesting consequence that the jump from one to two dimensions leads to a substantial increase in sample complexity, while increases beyond that do not. As a corollary of our general $A_k$ tester, we obtain $d_{\\mathrm TV}$-closeness testers for pairs of $k$-histograms on $\\mathbb R^d$ over a common unknown partition, and pairs of uniform distributions supported on the union of $k$ unknown disjoint axis-aligned rectangles.

    "abstract": "We propose novel fast algorithms for optimal transport (OT) utilizing a cyclic symmetry structure of input data. Such OT with cyclic symmetry appears universally in various real-world examples: image processing, urban planning, and graph processing. Our main idea is to reduce OT to a small optimization problem that has significantly fewer variables by utilizing cyclic symmetry and various optimization techniques. On the basis of this reduction, our algorithms solve the small optimization problem instead of the original OT. As a result, our algorithms obtain the optimal solution and the objective function value of the original OT faster than solving the original OT directly. In this paper, our focus is on two crucial OT formulations: the linear programming OT (LOT) and the strongly convex-regularized OT, which includes the well-known entropy-regularized OT (EROT). Experiments show the effectiveness of our algorithms for LOT and EROT in synthetic/real-world data that has a strict/approximate cyclic symmetry structure. Through theoretical and experimental results, this paper successfully introduces the concept of symmetry into the OT research field for the first time",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%",

We finetune open-source MPT-7B and MPT-30B models on instruction finetuning datasets of various sizes ranging from 1k to 60k samples. We find that subsets of 1k-6k instruction finetuning samples are sufficient to achieve good performance on both (1) traditional NLP benchmarks and (2) model-based evaluation.

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

A quadratic generalized moving least square (Q-GMLS) is employed to capture nonlinear dynamics and large deformation on the implicit model. Such meshless integration enables versatile simulations of complex and codimensional shapes. We adaptively place the least-square kernels according to the NeRF density field to significantly reduce the complexity of the nonlinear simulation.

    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Many real-world decision processes are modeled by optimization problems whose defining parameters are unknown and must be inferred from observable data. The Predict-Then-Optimize framework uses machine learning models to predict unknown parameters of an optimization problem from features before solving. Recent works show that decision quality can be improved in this setting by solving and differentiating the optimization problem in the training loop, enabling end-to-end training with loss functions defined directly on the resulting decisions. However, this approach can be inefficient and requires handcrafted, problem-specific rules for backpropagation through the optimization step. This paper proposes an alternative method, in which optimal solutions are learned directly from the observable features by predictive models. The approach is generic, and based on an adaptation of the Learning-to-Optimize paradigm, from which a rich variety of existing techniques can be employed.

Deep RL has been able to control complex systems with impressive fidelity and agility in simulation but the simulation-to-reality transfer often brings a hard-to-bridge reality gap. Moreover, RL is commonly plagued by prohibitively long training times. In this work, we propose a novel asymmetric actor-critic-based architecture coupled with a highly reliable RL-based training paradigm for end-to-end quadrotor control. We show how curriculum learning and a highly optimized simulator enhance sample complexity and lead to fast training times. To precisely discuss the challenges related to low-level/end-to-end multirotor control, we also introduce a taxonomy that classifies the existing levels of control abstractions as well as non-linearities and domain parameters. Our framework enables Simulation-to-Reality (Sim2Real) transfer for direct RPM control after only 18 seconds of training on a consumer-grade laptop as well as its deployment on microcontrollers to control a multirotor under real-time guarantees. Finally, our solution exhibits competitive performance in trajectory tracking, as demonstrated through various experimental comparisons with existing state-of-the-art control solutions using a real Crazyflie nano quadrotor. We open source the code including a very fast multirotor dynamics simulator that can simulate about 5 months of flight per second on a laptop GPU.

However, video synthesis methods recently started to develop. This paper presents a new two-stage latent diffusion text-to-video generation architecture based on the text-to-image diffusion model. The first stage concerns keyframes synthesis to figure the storyline of a video, while the second one is devoted to interpolation frames generation to make movements of the scene and objects smooth. We compare several temporal conditioning approaches for keyframes generation. The results show the advantage of using separate temporal blocks over temporal layers in terms of metrics reflecting video generation quality aspects and human preference. The design of our interpolation model significantly reduces computational costs compared to other masked frame interpolation approaches. Furthermore, we evaluate different configurations of MoVQ-based video decoding scheme to improve consistency and achieve higher PSNR, SSIM, MSE, and LPIPS scores. Finally, we compare our pipeline with existing solutions and achieve top-2 scores overall and top-1 among open-source solutions: CLIPSIM = 0.2976 and FVD = 433.054.

The main result of the paper is that there exists an estimator of $d$ that converges to $d$ in probability as $n \\to \\infty$ for all densities with $\\int f^5 < \\infty$ whenever $n^{3/2} r_n^d \\to \\infty$ and $r_n = o(1)$. The conditions allow very sparse graphs since when $n^{3/2} r_n^d \\to 0$, the graph contains isolated edges only, with high probability. We also show that, without any condition on the density, a consistent estimator of $d$ exists when $n r_n^d \\to \\infty$ and $r_n = o(1)$",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "High-resolution Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images are crucial for ophthalmology studies but are limited by their relatively narrow field of view (FoV). Image mosaicking is a technique for aligning multiple overlapping images to obtain a larger FoV. Current mosaicking pipelines often struggle with substantial noise and considerable displacement between the input sub-fields. In this paper, we propose a versatile pipeline for stitching multi-view OCT/OCTA \\textit{en face} projection images. Our method combines the strengths of learning-based feature matching and robust pixel-based registration to align multiple images effectively. Furthermore, we advance the application of a trained foundational model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to validate mosaicking results in an unsupervised manner. The efficacy of our pipeline is validated using an in-house dataset and a large public dataset, where our method shows superior performance in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency. We also made our evaluation tool for image mosaicking and the corresponding pipeline publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/MedICL-VU/OCT-mosaicking}",

    "abstract": "Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization",

Object-detection-based convolutional neural networks, regression analysis and multilayer perceptrons are combined to analyse visual data of the Viennese public during 2020. We find that mask-wearing-related government regulations and public-transport announcements encouraged correct mask-wearing-behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, changes in announcement and regulation contents led to heterogeneous effects on people's behaviour. Comparing the predictive power of regression analysis and neural networks, we demonstrate that the latter produces more accurate predictions of population reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our use of regression modelling also allows us to unearth possible causal pathways underlying societal behaviour. Since our findings highlight the importance of appropriate communication contents, our results will facilitate more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to be developed in future. Adding to the literature, we demonstrate that regression modelling and neural networks are not mutually exclusive but instead complement each other",

Emerging computing systems that are amenable to hardware-level probabilistic computing, such as those that leverage stochastic devices, may make probabilistic neural networks more feasible in the not-too-distant future. This paper describes the scANN technique -- \\textit{sampling (by coinflips) artificial neural networks} -- which enables neural networks to be sampled directly by treating the weights as Bernoulli coin flips. This method is natively well suited for probabilistic computing techniques that focus on tunable stochastic devices, nearly matches fully deterministic performance while also describing the uncertainty of correct and incorrect neural network outputs",

    "title": "Favour: FAst Variance Operator for Uncertainty Rating",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) have emerged as a crucial approach for interpreting ML predictions. By sampling from the posterior distribution, data scientists may estimate the uncertainty of an inference. Unfortunately many inference samples are often needed, the overhead of which greatly hinder BNN's wide adoption. To mitigate this, previous work proposed propagating the first and second moments of the posterior directly through the network. However, on its own this method is even slower than sampling, so the propagated variance needs to be approximated such as assuming independence between neural nodes. The resulting trade-off between quality and inference time did not match even plain Monte Carlo sampling. Our contribution is a more principled variance propagation framework based on \"spiked covariance matrices\", which smoothly interpolates between quality and inference time. This is made possible by a new fast algorithm for updating a diagonal-plus-low-rank matrix approximation under various operations. We tested our algorithm against sampling based MC Dropout and Variational Inference on a number of downstream uncertainty themed tasks, such as calibration and out-of-distribution testing. We find that Favour is as fast as performing 2-3 inference samples, while matching the performance of 10-100 samples. In summary, this work enables the use of BNN in the realm of performance critical tasks where they have previously been out of reach",

First, independent feature extraction is performed on each input surface using graph convolutions, generating low-dimensional feature representations that capture important cortical surface characteristics. Subsequently, features are registered in a deep-discrete manner to optimize the overlap of common structures across surfaces by learning displacements of a set of control points. To ensure smooth and biologically plausible deformations, we implement regularization through a deep conditional random field implemented with a recurrent neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoMorph surpasses existing deep-learning methods by achieving improved alignment with smoother deformations. Furthermore, GeoMorph exhibits competitive performance compared to classical frameworks. Such versatility and robustness suggest strong potential for various neuroscience applications",

    "title": "Fast and Interpretable Mortality Risk Scores for Critical Care Patients",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Prediction of mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is an important task in critical care medicine. Prior work in creating mortality risk models falls into two major categories: domain-expert-created scoring systems, and black box machine learning (ML) models. Both of these have disadvantages: black box models are unacceptable for use in hospitals, whereas manual creation of models (including hand-tuning of logistic regression parameters) relies on humans to perform high-dimensional constrained optimization, which leads to a loss in performance. In this work, we bridge the gap between accurate black box models and hand-tuned interpretable models. We build on modern interpretable ML techniques to design accurate and interpretable mortality risk scores. We leverage the largest existing public ICU monitoring datasets, namely the MIMIC III and eICU datasets. By evaluating risk across medical centers, we are able to study generalization across domains. In order to customize our risk score models, we develop a new algorithm, GroupFasterRisk, which has several important benefits: (1) it uses hard sparsity constraint, allowing users to directly control the number of features; (2) it incorporates group sparsity to allow more cohesive models; (3) it allows for monotonicity correction on models for including domain knowledge; (4) it produces many equally-good models at once, which allows domain experts to choose among them. GroupFasterRisk creates its risk scores within hours, even on the large datasets we study here. GroupFasterRisk's risk scores perform better than risk scores currently used in hospitals, and have similar prediction performance to black box ML models (despite being much sparser). Because GroupFasterRisk produces a variety of risk scores and handles constraints, it allows design flexibility, which is the key enabler of practical and trustworthy model creation",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of AI, combined with its unprecedented public adoption and the propensity of large neural networks to memorize training data, has given rise to significant data privacy concerns. To address these concerns, machine unlearning has emerged as an essential technique to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points on trained models. In this paper, we approach the machine unlearning problem through the lens of continual learning. Given a trained model and a subset of training data designated to be forgotten (i.e., the \"forget set\"), we introduce a three-step process, named CovarNav, to facilitate this forgetting. Firstly, we derive a proxy for the model's training data using a model inversion attack. Secondly, we mislabel the forget set by selecting the most probable class that deviates from the actual ground truth. Lastly, we deploy a gradient projection method to minimize the cross-entropy loss on the modified forget set (i.e., learn incorrect labels for this set) while preventing forgetting of the inverted samples. We rigorously evaluate CovarNav on the CIFAR-10 and Vggface2 datasets, comparing our results with recent benchmarks in the field and demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach",

Given the inherent compositional nature of language, one can expect the model to learn to compose these capabilities, potentially yielding a combinatorial explosion of what operations it can perform on an input. Motivated by the above, we aim to assess in this paper \"how capable can a transformer become?\". Specifically, we train autoregressive Transformer models on a data-generating process that involves compositions of a set of well-defined monolithic capabilities. Through a series of extensive and systematic experiments on this data-generating process, we show that: (1) autoregressive Transformers can learn compositional structures from the training data and generalize to exponentially or even combinatorially many functions; (2) composing functions by generating intermediate outputs is more effective at generalizing to unseen compositions, compared to generating no intermediate outputs; (3) the training data has a significant impact on the model's ability to compose unseen combinations of functions; and (4) the attention layers in the latter half of the model are critical to compositionality",

This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations. We present an in-depth evaluation of an object detection model that integrates the Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet)as its backbone with the DiffusionDet head, utilizing the iSAID dataset for empirical analysis. Our approach encompasses the introduction of novel methodologies and extensive ablation studies. These studies critically assess various aspects such as loss functions, box regression techniques, and classification strategies to refine the model's precision in object detection. The paper details the experimental application of the LSKNet backbone in synergy with the DiffusionDet heads, a combination tailored to meet the specific challenges in aerial image object detection. The findings of this research indicate a substantial enhancement in the model's performance, especially in the accuracy-time tradeoff. The proposed model achieves a mean average precision (MAP) of approximately 45.7%, which is a significant improvement, outperforming the RCNN model by 4.7% on the same dataset.

However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem.

This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional model improves over various marginal baselines.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present hierarchical learning, a novel variational architecture for efficient training of large-scale variational quantum circuits. We test and benchmark our technique for distribution loading with quantum circuit born machines (QCBMs). With QCBMs, probability distributions are loaded into the squared amplitudes of computational basis vectors represented by bitstrings. Our key insight is to take advantage of the fact that the most significant (qu)bits have a greater effect on the final distribution and can be learned first. One can think of it as a generalization of layerwise learning, where some parameters of the variational circuit are learned first to prevent the phenomena of barren plateaus. We briefly review adjoint methods for computing the gradient, in particular for loss functions that are not expectation values of observables. We first compare the role of connectivity in the variational ansatz for the task of loading a Gaussian distribution on nine qubits, finding that 2D connectivity greatly outperforms qubits arranged on a line. Based on our observations, we then implement this strategy on large-scale numerical experiments with GPUs, training a QCBM to reproduce a 3-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution on 27 qubits up to $\\sim4\\%$ total variation distance. Though barren plateau arguments do not strictly apply here due to the objective function not being tied to an observable, this is to our knowledge the first practical demonstration of variational learning on large numbers of qubits. We also demonstrate hierarchical learning as a resource-efficient way to load distributions for existing quantum hardware (IBM's 7 and 27 qubit devices) in tandem with Fire Opal optimizations",

Shape-from-Template (SfT) methods aim to reconstruct a template-based geometry from RGB images or video sequences, often leveraging just a single monocular camera without depth information, such as regular smartphone recordings. Unfortunately, existing reconstruction methods are either unphysical and noisy or slow in optimization. To solve this problem, we propose a novel SfT reconstruction algorithm for cloth using a pre-trained neural surrogate model that is fast to evaluate, stable, and produces smooth reconstructions due to a regularizing physics simulation. Differentiable rendering of the simulated mesh enables pixel-wise comparisons between the reconstruction and a target video sequence that can be used for a gradient-based optimization procedure to extract not only shape information but also physical parameters such as stretching, shearing, or bending stiffness of the cloth. This allows to retain a precise, stable, and smooth reconstructed geometry while reducing the runtime by a factor of 400-500 compared to $\\phi$-SfT, a state-of-the-art physics-based SfT approach",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models has become the de facto strategy for developing both task-specific and general-purpose machine learning systems, including developing models that are safe to deploy. Despite its clear importance, there has been minimal work that explains how fine-tuning alters the underlying capabilities learned by a model during pretraining: does fine-tuning yield entirely novel capabilities or does it just modulate existing ones? We address this question empirically in synthetic, controlled settings where we can use mechanistic interpretability tools (e.g., network pruning and probing) to understand how the model's underlying capabilities are changing. We perform an extensive analysis of the effects of fine-tuning in these settings, and show that: (i) fine-tuning rarely alters the underlying model capabilities; (ii) a minimal transformation, which we call a 'wrapper', is typically learned on top of the underlying model capabilities, creating the illusion that they have been modified; and (iii) further fine-tuning on a task where such hidden capabilities are relevant leads to sample-efficient 'revival' of the capability, i.e., the model begins reusing these capability after only a few gradient steps. This indicates that practitioners can unintentionally remove a model's safety wrapper merely by fine-tuning it on a, e.g., superficially unrelated, downstream task.

Both results, however, are optimal only in the worst case. We initiate the fine-grained study of the mean estimation problem: Can algorithms leverage useful features of the input distribution to beat the sub-Gaussian rate, without explicit knowledge of such features? We resolve this question with an unexpectedly nuanced answer: \"Yes in limited regimes, but in general no\". For any distribution $p$ with a finite mean, we construct a distribution $q$ whose mean is well-separated from $p$'s, yet $p$ and $q$ are not distinguishable with high probability, and $q$ further preserves $p$'s moments up to constants. The main consequence is that no reasonable estimator can asymptotically achieve better than the sub-Gaussian error rate for any distribution, matching the worst-case result of [LV22]. More generally, we introduce a new definitional framework to analyze the fine-grained optimality of algorithms, which we call \"neighborhood optimality\", interpolating between the unattainably strong \"instance optimality\" and the trivially weak \"admissibility\" definitions. Applying the new framework, we show that median-of-means is neighborhood optimal, up to constant factors. It is open to find a neighborhood-optimal estimator without constant factor slackness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Automatic assessment of impairment and disease severity is a key challenge in data-driven medicine. We propose a novel framework to address this challenge, which leverages AI models trained exclusively on healthy individuals. The COnfidence-Based chaRacterization of Anomalies (COBRA) score exploits the decrease in confidence of these models when presented with impaired or diseased patients to quantify their deviation from the healthy population. We applied the COBRA score to address a key limitation of current clinical evaluation of upper-body impairment in stroke patients. The gold-standard Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) requires in-person administration by a trained assessor for 30-45 minutes, which restricts monitoring frequency and precludes physicians from adapting rehabilitation protocols to the progress of each patient. The COBRA score, computed automatically in under one minute, is shown to be strongly correlated with the FMA on an independent test cohort for two different data modalities: wearable sensors ($\\rho = 0.845$, 95% CI [0.743,0.908]) and video ($\\rho = 0.746$, 95% C.I [0.594, 0.847]). To demonstrate the generalizability of the approach to other conditions, the COBRA score was also applied to quantify severity of knee osteoarthritis from magnetic-resonance imaging scans, again achieving significant correlation with an independent clinical assessment ($\\rho = 0.644$, 95% C.I [0.585,0.696])",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Ensuring high-quality video content for wireless users has become increasingly vital. Nevertheless, maintaining a consistent level of video quality faces challenges due to the fluctuating encoded bitrate, primarily caused by dynamic video content, especially in live streaming scenarios. Video compression is typically employed to eliminate unnecessary redundancies within and between video frames, thereby reducing the required bandwidth for video transmission. The encoded bitrate and the quality of the compressed video depend on encoder parameters, specifically, the quantization parameter (QP). Poor choices of encoder parameters can result in reduced bandwidth efficiency and high likelihood of non-conformance. Non-conformance refers to the violation of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) constraint for an encoded video segment. To address these issues, a real-time deep learning-based H.264 controller is proposed. This controller dynamically estimates the optimal encoder parameters based on the content of a video chunk with minimal delay. The objective is to maintain video quality in terms of PSNR above a specified threshold while minimizing the average bitrate of the compressed video. Experimental results, conducted on both QCIF dataset and a diverse range of random videos from public datasets, validate the effectiveness of this approach. Notably, it achieves improvements of up to 2.5 times in average bandwidth usage compared to the state-of-the-art adaptive bitrate video streaming, with a negligible non-conformance probability below $10^{-2}$",

Cancer phylogenies can be reconstructed using data obtained from bulk DNA sequencing of multiple tissue samples from the same cancer. We introduce Orchard, a fast algorithm that reconstructs cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected in bulk DNA sequencing data. Orchard constructs cancer phylogenies progressively, one point mutation at a time, ultimately sampling complete phylogenies from a posterior distribution implied by the bulk DNA data. Orchard reconstructs more plausible phylogenies than state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods on 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). These results demonstrate that Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies with up to 300 mutations. We then introduce a simple graph based clustering algorithm that uses a reconstructed phylogeny to infer unique groups of mutations i.e., mutation clusters, that characterize the genetic differences between cancer cell populations, and show that this approach is competitive with state-of-the-art mutation clustering methods",

Current methods of visualisation-based malware classification largely rely on lossy transformations of inputs such as resizing to handle the large, variable-sized images.

The proposed solution divides the images into patches and uses embedding-based multiple instance learning with a convolutional neural network and an attention aggregation function for classification. The implementation is evaluated on the Microsoft Malware Classification dataset and achieves accuracies of up to $96.6\\%$ on adversarially enlarged samples compared to the baseline of $22.8\\%$.

An animated sketch opens another dimension to the expression of ideas and is widely used by designers for a variety of purposes. Animating sketches is a laborious process, requiring extensive experience and professional design skills. In this work, we present a method that automatically adds motion to a single-subject sketch (hence, \"breathing life into it\"), merely by providing a text prompt indicating the desired motion. The output is a short animation provided in vector representation, which can be easily edited. Our method does not require extensive training, but instead leverages the motion prior of a large pretrained text-to-video diffusion model using a score-distillation loss to guide the placement of strokes. To promote natural and smooth motion and to better preserve the sketch's appearance, we model the learned motion through two components. The first governs small local deformations and the second controls global affine transformations. Surprisingly, we find that even models that struggle to generate sketch videos on their own can still serve as a useful backbone for animating abstract representations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "3D occupancy prediction is an important task for the robustness of vision-centric autonomous driving, which aims to predict whether each point is occupied in the surrounding 3D space. Existing methods usually require 3D occupancy labels to produce meaningful results. However, it is very laborious to annotate the occupancy status of each voxel. In this paper, we propose SelfOcc to explore a self-supervised way to learn 3D occupancy using only video sequences. We first transform the images into the 3D space (e.g., bird's eye view) to obtain 3D representation of the scene. We directly impose constraints on the 3D representations by treating them as signed distance fields. We can then render 2D images of previous and future frames as self-supervision signals to learn the 3D representations. We propose an MVS-embedded strategy to directly optimize the SDF-induced weights with multiple depth proposals. Our SelfOcc outperforms the previous best method SceneRF by 58.7% using a single frame as input on SemanticKITTI and is the first self-supervised work that produces reasonable 3D occupancy for surround cameras on Occ3D. SelfOcc produces high-quality depth and achieves state-of-the-art results on novel depth synthesis, monocular depth estimation, and surround-view depth estimation on the SemanticKITTI, KITTI-2015, and nuScenes, respectively.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We present the neural-integrated meshfree (NIM) method, a differentiable programming-based hybrid meshfree approach within the field of computational mechanics. NIM seamlessly integrates traditional physics-based meshfree discretization techniques with deep learning architectures. It employs a hybrid approximation scheme, NeuroPU, to effectively represent the solution by combining continuous DNN representations with partition of unity (PU) basis functions associated with the underlying spatial discretization. This neural-numerical hybridization not only enhances the solution representation through functional space decomposition but also reduces both the size of DNN model and the need for spatial gradient computations based on automatic differentiation, leading to a significant improvement in training efficiency. Under the NIM framework, we propose two truly meshfree solvers: the strong form-based NIM (S-NIM) and the local variational form-based NIM (V-NIM). In the S-NIM solver, the strong-form governing equation is directly considered in the loss function, while the V-NIM solver employs a local Petrov-Galerkin approach that allows the construction of variational residuals based on arbitrary overlapping subdomains. This ensures both the satisfaction of underlying physics and the preservation of meshfree property. We perform extensive numerical experiments on both stationary and transient benchmark problems to assess the effectiveness of the proposed NIM methods in terms of accuracy, scalability, generalizability, and convergence properties. Moreover, comparative analysis with other physics-informed machine learning methods demonstrates that NIM, especially V-NIM, significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in end-to-end predictive capabilities",

However, the filters or convolutions, applied during iterations/layers to these initial embeddings lead to their impact diminish and contribute insignificantly to the final embeddings. In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose augmenting nodes' embeddings by embeddings generating from their content, at higher GNN layers. More precisely, we propose models wherein a structural embedding using a GNN and a content embedding are computed for each node. These two are combined using a combination layer to form the embedding of a node at a given layer. We suggest methods such as using an auto-encoder or building a content graph, to generate content embeddings. In the end, by conducting experiments over several real-world datasets, we demonstrate the high accuracy and performance of our models",

These metrics should be chosen so as to capture the downstream impact of each module and the performance of the system as a whole. For example, high perception quality should enable prediction and planning to be performed safely. Even though this is true in general, we show here that it is possible to construct planner inputs that score very highly on various perception quality metrics but still lead to planning failures. In an analogy to adversarial attacks on image classifiers, we call such inputs \\textbf{adversarial perception errors} and show they can be systematically constructed using a simple boundary-attack algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by finding attacks for two different black-box planners in several urban and highway driving scenarios using the CARLA simulator. Finally, we analyse the properties of these attacks and show that they are isolated in the input space of the planner, and discuss their implications for AD system deployment and testing",

It is now well understood that by controlling only a small subset of FL clients, it is possible to introduce a backdoor to a federated learning model, in the presence of certain attributes. In this paper, we present a new type of attack that compromises the fairness of the trained model. Fairness is understood to be the attribute-level performance distribution of a trained model. It is particularly salient in domains where, for example, skewed accuracy discrimination between subpopulations could have disastrous consequences. We find that by employing a threat model similar to that of a backdoor attack, an attacker is able to influence the aggregated model to have an unfair performance distribution between any given set of attributes. Furthermore, we find that this attack is possible by controlling only a single client. While combating naturally induced unfairness in FL has previously been discussed in depth, its artificially induced kind has been neglected. We show that defending against attacks on fairness should be a critical consideration in any situation where unfairness in a trained model could benefit a user who participated in its training",

Conversely, if the model is overconfident on the calibration set, the use of conformal prediction may improve out-of-distribution coverage. We evaluate prediction sets as a result of combining split conformal methods and neural networks trained with (i) stochastic gradient descent, (ii) deep ensembles, and (iii) mean-field variational inference. Our results suggest that combining Bayesian deep learning models with split conformal prediction can, in some cases, cause unintended consequences such as reducing out-of-distribution coverage",

    "title": "Managing ML-Based Application Non-Functional Behavior: A Multi-Model Approach",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Modern applications are increasingly driven by Machine Learning (ML) models whose non-deterministic behavior is affecting the entire application life cycle from design to operation. The pervasive adoption of ML is urgently calling for approaches that guarantee a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications over time and across model changes. To this aim, non-functional properties of ML models, such as privacy, confidentiality, fairness, and explainability, must be monitored, verified, and maintained. This need is even more pressing when modern applications operate in the edge-cloud continuum, increasing their complexity and dynamicity. Existing approaches mostly focus on i) implementing classifier selection solutions according to the functional behavior of ML models, ii) finding new algorithmic solutions to this need, such as continuous re-training. In this paper, we propose a multi-model approach built on dynamic classifier selection, where multiple ML models showing similar non-functional properties are made available to the application and one model is selected over time according to (dynamic and unpredictable) contextual changes. Our solution goes beyond the state of the art by providing an architectural and methodological approach that continuously guarantees a stable non-functional behavior of ML-based applications, is applicable to different ML models, and is driven by non-functional properties assessed on the models themselves. It consists of a two-step process working during application operation, where model assessment verifies non-functional properties of ML models trained and selected at development time, and model substitution guarantees a continuous and stable support of non-functional properties. We experimentally evaluate our solution in a real-world scenario focusing on non-functional property fairness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The unequal representation of different groups in a sample population can lead to discrimination of minority groups when machine learning models make automated decisions. To address these issues, fairness-aware machine learning jointly optimizes two (or more) metrics aiming at predictive effectiveness and low unfairness. However, the inherent under-representation of minorities in the data makes the disparate treatment of subpopulations less noticeable and difficult to deal with during learning. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial reweighting method to address such \\emph{representation bias}. To balance the data distribution between the majority and the minority groups, our approach deemphasizes samples from the majority group. To minimize empirical risk, our method prefers samples from the majority group that are close to the minority group as evaluated by the Wasserstein distance. Our theoretical analysis shows the effectiveness of our adversarial reweighting approach. Experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates bias without sacrificing classification accuracy, outperforming related state-of-the-art methods on image and tabular benchmark datasets",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Capturing smooth motions from videos using markerless techniques typically involves complex processes such as temporal constraints, multiple stages with data-driven regression and optimization, and bundle solving over temporal windows. These processes can be inefficient and require tuning multiple objectives across stages. In contrast, BundleMoCap introduces a novel and efficient approach to this problem. It solves the motion capture task in a single stage, eliminating the need for temporal smoothness objectives while still delivering smooth motions. BundleMoCap outperforms the state-of-the-art without increasing complexity. The key concept behind BundleMoCap is manifold interpolation between latent keyframes. By relying on a local manifold smoothness assumption, we can efficiently solve a bundle of frames using a single code. Additionally, the method can be implemented as a sliding window optimization and requires only the first frame to be properly initialized, reducing the overall computational burden. BundleMoCap's strength lies in its ability to achieve high-quality motion capture results with simplicity and efficiency. More details can be found at https://moverseai.github.io/bundle/",

One reason is that the lack of deep understanding and comprehensive interpretation of the Transformer architecture makes it more challenging to improve the Transformer architecture. In this paper, we first interpret the Transformer architecture comprehensively in plain words based on our understanding and experiences. The interpretations are further proved and verified. These interpretations also cover the Extractor, a family of drop-in replacements for the multi-head self-attention in the Transformer architecture. Then, we propose an improvement on a type of the Extractor that outperforms the self-attention, without introducing additional trainable parameters.

In this paper, we show how real data can be used for self-supervised learning without any transformations by taking advantage of the symmetry present in the activities. Our approach involves contrastive matching of two different sensors (left and right wrist or leg-worn IMUs) to make representations of co-occurring sensor data more similar and those of non-co-occurring sensor data more different. We test our approach on the Opportunity and MM-Fit datasets. In MM-Fit we show significant improvement over the baseline supervised and self-supervised method SimCLR, while for Opportunity there is significant improvement over the supervised baseline and slight improvement when compared to SimCLR. Moreover, our method improves supervised baselines even when using only a small amount of the data for training.

Learning on graph models have drawn special attention as they can significantly reduce drug repurposing costs and time commitment. However, many current approaches require high-demanding additional information besides DTIs that complicates their evaluation process and usability. Additionally, structural differences in the learning architecture of current models hinder their fair benchmarking. In this work, we first perform an in-depth evaluation of current DTI datasets and prediction models through a robust benchmarking process, and show that DTI prediction methods based on transductive models lack generalization and lead to inflated performance when evaluated as previously done in the literature, hence not being suited for drug repurposing approaches. We then propose a novel biologically-driven strategy for negative edge subsampling and show through in vitro validation that newly discovered interactions are indeed true.

In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-Pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences, we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation, improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences, opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods",

    "abstract": "Carbohydrates, vital components of biological systems, are well-known for their structural diversity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy plays a crucial role in understanding their intricate molecular arrangements and is essential in assessing and verifying the molecular structure of organic molecules. An important part of this process is to predict the NMR chemical shift from the molecular structure. This work introduces a novel approach that leverages E(3) equivariant graph neural networks to predict carbohydrate NMR spectra. Notably, our model achieves a substantial reduction in mean absolute error, up to threefold, compared to traditional models that rely solely on two-dimensional molecular structure. Even with limited data, the model excels, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities. The implications are far-reaching and go beyond an advanced understanding of carbohydrate structures and spectral interpretation. For example, it could accelerate research in pharmaceutical applications, biochemistry, and structural biology, offering a faster and more reliable analysis of molecular structures. Furthermore, our approach is a key step towards a new data-driven era in spectroscopy, potentially influencing spectroscopic techniques beyond NMR",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recently, compositional optimization (CO) has gained popularity because of its applications in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and many other machine learning problems. Large-scale and distributed availability of data demands the development of efficient federated learning (FL) algorithms for solving CO problems. Developing FL algorithms for CO is particularly challenging because of the compositional nature of the objective. Moreover, current state-of-the-art methods to solve such problems rely on large batch gradients (depending on the solution accuracy) not feasible for most practical settings. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose efficient FedAvg-type algorithms for solving non-convex CO in the FL setting. We first establish that vanilla FedAvg is not suitable to solve distributed CO problems because of the data heterogeneity in the compositional objective at each client which leads to the amplification of bias in the local compositional gradient estimates. To this end, we propose a novel FL framework FedDRO that utilizes the DRO problem structure to design a communication strategy that allows FedAvg to control the bias in the estimation of the compositional gradient. A key novelty of our work is to develop solution accuracy-independent algorithms that do not require large batch gradients (and function evaluations) for solving federated CO problems. We establish $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-3/2})$ communication complexity in the FL setting while achieving linear speedup with the number of clients. We corroborate our theoretical findings with empirical studies on large-scale DRO problems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Graph pooling has been increasingly recognized as crucial for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to facilitate hierarchical graph representation learning. Existing graph pooling methods commonly consist of two stages: selecting top-ranked nodes and discarding the remaining to construct coarsened graph representations. However, this paper highlights two key issues with these methods: 1) The process of selecting nodes to discard frequently employs additional Graph Convolutional Networks or Multilayer Perceptrons, lacking a thorough evaluation of each node's impact on the final graph representation and subsequent prediction tasks. 2) Current graph pooling methods tend to directly discard the noise segment (dropped) of the graph without accounting for the latent information contained within these elements. To address the first issue, we introduce a novel Graph Explicit Pooling (GrePool) method, which selects nodes by explicitly leveraging the relationships between the nodes and final representation vectors crucial for classification. The second issue is addressed using an extended version of GrePool (i.e., GrePool+), which applies a uniform loss on the discarded nodes. This addition is designed to augment the training process and improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 widely used datasets to validate our proposed method's effectiveness, including the Open Graph Benchmark datasets. Our experimental results uniformly demonstrate that GrePool outperforms 14 baseline methods for most datasets. Likewise, implementing GrePool+ enhances GrePool's performance without incurring additional computational costs",

Despite this, little work has been performed on endowing Koopman learning with the ability to learn from its own mistakes. To address this, we equip Koopman methods - developed for predicting non-stationary time-series - with an episodic memory mechanism, enabling global recall of (or attention to) periods in time where similar dynamics previously occurred. We find that a basic implementation of Koopman learning with episodic memory leads to significant improvements in prediction on synthetic and real-world data.

For the MMDP, we assume the state dynamics to be controlled by the joint actions of agents, but the per-stage costs to only depend on the individual agent's actions. We combine the Q-learning algorithm for a weighted combination of the costs of each agent, obtained by a gossip algorithm with the Metropolis-Hastings or Multiplicative Weights formalisms to modulate the averaging matrix of the gossip. We use multiple timescales in our algorithm and prove that under mild conditions, it approximately achieves the desired bounds for each of the agents.

    "abstract": "Humans rely on their visual and tactile senses to develop a comprehensive 3D understanding of their physical environment. Recently, there has been a growing interest in exploring and manipulating objects using data-driven approaches that utilise high-resolution vision-based tactile sensors. However, 3D shape reconstruction using tactile sensing has lagged behind visual shape reconstruction because of limitations in existing techniques, including the inability to generalise over unseen shapes, the absence of real-world testing, and limited expressive capacity imposed by discrete representations. To address these challenges, we propose TouchSDF, a Deep Learning approach for tactile 3D shape reconstruction that leverages the rich information provided by a vision-based tactile sensor and the expressivity of the implicit neural representation DeepSDF. Our technique consists of two components: (1) a Convolutional Neural Network that maps tactile images into local meshes representing the surface at the touch location, and (2) an implicit neural function that predicts a signed distance function to extract the desired 3D shape. This combination allows TouchSDF to reconstruct smooth and continuous 3D shapes from tactile inputs in simulation and real-world settings, opening up research avenues for robust 3D-aware representations and improved multimodal perception in robotics.

Our results indicate that the temporal segmentation significantly improves the classification, with AUC-ROC = 0.93, F1 score = 0.84( LightGBM- without any segmentation) and AUC-ROC = 0.98, F1 score = 0.93( LightGBM- with segmentation). Distinguishing between diurnal and nocturnal segments amplifies the differences between Schizophrenia patients and controls. However, further subdivisions into smaller time segments do not affect the AUC- ROC significantly. Morning, afternoon, evening, and night partitioning gives similar classification performance to day-night partitioning. These findings are valuable as they indicate that extensive temporal classification beyond distinguishing between day and night does not yield substantial results, offering an efficient approach for further classification, early diagnosis, and monitoring of Schizophrenia",

    "title": "Improving Source-Free Target Adaptation with Vision Transformers Leveraging Domain Representation Images",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, navigating the obstacle of domain shift. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a staple in UDA, the rise of Vision Transformers (ViTs) provides new avenues for domain generalization. This paper presents an innovative method to bolster ViT performance in source-free target adaptation, beginning with an evaluation of how key, query, and value elements affect ViT outcomes. Experiments indicate that altering the key component has negligible effects on Transformer performance. Leveraging this discovery, we introduce Domain Representation Images (DRIs), feeding embeddings through the key element. DRIs act as domain-specific markers, effortlessly merging with the training regimen. To assess our method, we perform target adaptation tests on the Cross Instance DRI source-only (SO) control. We measure the efficacy of target adaptation with and without DRIs, against existing benchmarks like SHOT-B* and adaptations via CDTrans. Findings demonstrate that excluding DRIs offers limited gains over SHOT-B*, while their inclusion in the key segment boosts average precision promoting superior domain generalization. This research underscores the vital role of DRIs in enhancing ViT efficiency in UDA scenarios, setting a precedent for further domain adaptation explorations",

    "title": "Revisiting the Domain Shift and Sample Uncertainty in Multi-source Active Domain Transfer",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) aims to maximally boost model adaptation in a new target domain by actively selecting a limited number of target data to annotate.This setting neglects the more practical scenario where training data are collected from multiple sources. This motivates us to target a new and challenging setting of knowledge transfer that extends ADA from a single source domain to multiple source domains, termed Multi-source Active Domain Adaptation (MADA). Not surprisingly, we find that most traditional ADA methods cannot work directly in such a setting, mainly due to the excessive domain gap introduced by all the source domains and thus their uncertainty-aware sample selection can easily become miscalibrated under the multi-domain shifts. Considering this, we propose a Dynamic integrated uncertainty valuation framework(Detective) that comprehensively consider the domain shift between multi-source domains and target domain to detect the informative target samples. Specifically, the leverages a dynamic Domain Adaptation(DA) model that learns how to adapt the model's parameters to fit the union of multi-source domains. This enables an approximate single-source domain modeling by the dynamic model. We then comprehensively measure both domain uncertainty and predictive uncertainty in the target domain to detect informative target samples using evidential deep learning, thereby mitigating uncertainty miscalibration. Furthermore, we introduce a contextual diversity-aware calculator to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms existing methods by a considerable margin on three domain adaptation benchmarks",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Big data and large-scale machine learning have had a profound impact on science and engineering, particularly in fields focused on forecasting and prediction. Yet, it is still not clear how we can use the superior pattern matching abilities of machine learning models for scientific discovery. This is because the goals of machine learning and science are generally not aligned. In addition to being accurate, scientific theories must also be causally consistent with the underlying physical process and allow for human analysis, reasoning, and manipulation to advance the field. In this paper, we present a case study on discovering a new symbolic model for oceanic rogue waves from data using causal analysis, deep learning, parsimony-guided model selection, and symbolic regression. We train an artificial neural network on causal features from an extensive dataset of observations from wave buoys, while selecting for predictive performance and causal invariance. We apply symbolic regression to distill this black-box model into a mathematical equation that retains the neural network's predictive capabilities, while allowing for interpretation in the context of existing wave theory. The resulting model reproduces known behavior, generates well-calibrated probabilities, and achieves better predictive scores on unseen data than current theory. This showcases how machine learning can facilitate inductive scientific discovery, and paves the way for more accurate rogue wave forecasting",

We provide case studies of several incidents across three illustrative platforms -- Hugging Face, GitHub and Civitai -- to examine how model marketplaces moderate models. Building on this analysis, we outline important (and yet nevertheless limited) practices that industry has been developing to respond to moderation demands: licensing, access and use restrictions, automated content moderation, and open policy development.

    "abstract": "The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Categorical random variables can faithfully represent the discrete and uncertain aspects of data as part of a discrete latent variable model. Learning in such models necessitates taking gradients with respect to the parameters of the categorical probability distributions, which is often intractable due to their combinatorial nature. A popular technique to estimate these otherwise intractable gradients is the Log-Derivative trick. This trick forms the basis of the well-known REINFORCE gradient estimator and its many extensions. While the Log-Derivative trick allows us to differentiate through samples drawn from categorical distributions, it does not take into account the discrete nature of the distribution itself. Our first contribution addresses this shortcoming by introducing the CatLog-Derivative trick - a variation of the Log-Derivative trick tailored towards categorical distributions. Secondly, we use the CatLog-Derivative trick to introduce IndeCateR, a novel and unbiased gradient estimator for the important case of products of independent categorical distributions with provably lower variance than REINFORCE. Thirdly, we empirically show that IndeCateR can be efficiently implemented and that its gradient estimates have significantly lower bias and variance for the same number of samples compared to the state of the art",

We parameterize this mixture distribution as a spline normalizing flow, which we train using variational inference. The proposed form of the variational posterior enables a sparse variational elliptical process applicable to large-scale problems. We highlight advantages compared to Gaussian processes through regression and classification experiments.

    "abstract": "In multi-lingual societies, where multiple languages are spoken in a small geographic vicinity, informal conversations often involve mix of languages. Existing speech technologies may be inefficient in extracting information from such conversations, where the speech data is rich in diversity with multiple languages and speakers. The DISPLACE (DIarization of SPeaker and LAnguage in Conversational Environments) challenge constitutes an open-call for evaluating and bench-marking the speaker and language diarization technologies on this challenging condition. The challenge entailed two tracks: Track-1 focused on speaker diarization (SD) in multilingual situations while, Track-2 addressed the language diarization (LD) in a multi-speaker scenario. Both the tracks were evaluated using the same underlying audio data. To facilitate this evaluation, a real-world dataset featuring multilingual, multi-speaker conversational far-field speech was recorded and distributed. Furthermore, a baseline system was made available for both SD and LD task which mimicked the state-of-art in these tasks. The challenge garnered a total of $42$ world-wide registrations and received a total of $19$ combined submissions for Track-1 and Track-2. This paper describes the challenge, details of the datasets, tasks, and the baseline system. Additionally, the paper provides a concise overview of the submitted systems in both tracks, with an emphasis given to the top performing systems. The paper also presents insights and future perspectives for SD and LD tasks, focusing on the key challenges that the systems need to overcome before wide-spread commercial deployment on such conversations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spatial and intensity normalization are nowadays a prerequisite for neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's Disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analysing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalization still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessing. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization -- and its type -- is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted",

Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals.

To address these issues, we firstly introduce a concentrated loss function based on an adaptive calibration kernel that reweights the simulated data appropriately to improve the data efficiency.

The framework of regularisation by projection is then used to find a reconstruction. The second one uses a simplified model of the physics of the measurement process and only relies on the training data to learn a model correction.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Neural operators extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by allowing them to handle mappings between function spaces for the purpose of solving partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which is inspired by Green's function method and approximate operator kernel directly in the frequency domain. In this work, we focus on predicting multiscale dynamic spaces, which is equivalent to solving multiscale PDEs. Multiscale PDEs are characterized by rapid coefficient changes and solution space oscillations, which are crucial for modeling atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To solve this problem, models should have the ability to capture rapid changes and process them at various scales. However, the FNO only approximates kernels in the low-frequency domain, which is insufficient when solving multiscale PDEs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical neural operator that integrates improved Fourier layers with attention mechanisms, aiming to capture all details and handle them at various scales. These mechanisms complement each other in the frequency domain and encourage the model to solve multiscale problems. We perform experiments on dynamic spaces governed by forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations and some other physical scenarios, and reach superior performance in existing PDE benchmarks, especially equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations",

    "title": "From Microbes to Methane: AI-Based Predictive Modeling of Feed Additive Efficacy in Dairy Cows",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In an era of increasing pressure to achieve sustainable agriculture, the optimization of livestock feed for enhancing yield and minimizing environmental impact is a paramount objective. This study presents a pioneering approach towards this goal, using rumen microbiome data to predict the efficacy of feed additives in dairy cattle. We collected an extensive dataset that includes methane emissions from 2,190 Holstein cows distributed across 34 distinct sites. The cows were divided into control and experimental groups in a double-blind, unbiased manner, accounting for variables such as age, days in lactation, and average milk yield. The experimental groups were administered one of four leading commercial feed additives: Agolin, Kexxtone, Allimax, and Relyon. Methane emissions were measured individually both before the administration of additives and over a subsequent 12-week period. To develop our predictive model for additive efficacy, rumen microbiome samples were collected from 510 cows from the same herds prior to the study's onset. These samples underwent deep metagenomic shotgun sequencing, yielding an average of 15.7 million reads per sample. Utilizing innovative artificial intelligence techniques we successfully estimated the efficacy of these feed additives across different farms. The model's robustness was further confirmed through validation with independent cohorts, affirming its generalizability and reliability. Our results underscore the transformative capability of using targeted feed additive strategies to both optimize dairy yield and milk composition, and to significantly reduce methane emissions. Specifically, our predictive model demonstrates a scenario where its application could guide the assignment of additives to farms where they are most effective.

Ahmadian et al. [2020] established the study of fairness in \\textit{hierarchical} clustering, a stronger, more structured variant of its well-known flat counterpart, though their proposed algorithm that optimizes for Dasgupta's [2016] famous cost function was highly theoretical. Knittel et al. [2023] then proposed the first practical fair approximation for cost, however they were unable to break the polynomial-approximate barrier they posed as a hurdle of interest. We break this barrier, proposing the first truly polylogarithmic-approximate low-cost fair hierarchical clustering, thus greatly bridging the gap between the best fair and vanilla hierarchical clustering approximations",

    "title": "Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition: A taxonomy and framework",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) extends traditional RL by seeking policies making different compromises among conflicting objectives. The recent surge of interest in MORL has led to diverse studies and solving methods, often drawing from existing knowledge in multi-objective optimization based on decomposition (MOO/D). Yet, a clear categorization based on both RL and MOO/D is lacking in the existing literature. Consequently, MORL researchers face difficulties when trying to classify contributions within a broader context due to the absence of a standardized taxonomy. To tackle such an issue, this paper introduces Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning based on Decomposition (MORL/D), a novel methodology bridging RL and MOO literature. A comprehensive taxonomy for MORL/D is presented, providing a structured foundation for categorizing existing and potential MORL works. The introduced taxonomy is then used to scrutinize MORL research, enhancing clarity and conciseness through well-defined categorization. Moreover, a flexible framework derived from the taxonomy is introduced. This framework accommodates diverse instantiations using tools from both RL and MOO/D. Implementation across various configurations demonstrates its versatility, assessed against benchmark problems. Results indicate MORL/D instantiations achieve comparable performance with significantly greater versatility than current state-of-the-art approaches. By presenting the taxonomy and framework, this paper offers a comprehensive perspective and a unified vocabulary for MORL. This not only facilitates the identification of algorithmic contributions but also lays the groundwork for novel research avenues in MORL, contributing to the continued advancement of this field",

    "abstract": "This research delves into the intricacies of Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, and its associated blockchain, which records all transactions since its inception. While this ensures integrity and transparency, the transparent nature of Bitcoin potentially compromises users' privacy rights. To address this concern, users have adopted CoinJoin, a method that amalgamates multiple transaction intents into a single, larger transaction to bolster transactional privacy. This process complicates individual transaction tracing and disrupts many established blockchain analysis heuristics. Despite its significance, limited research has been conducted on identifying CoinJoin transactions. Particularly noteworthy are varied CoinJoin implementations such as JoinMarket, Wasabi, and Whirlpool, each presenting distinct challenges due to their unique transaction structures. This study delves deeply into the open-source implementations of these protocols, aiming to develop refined heuristics for identifying their transactions on the blockchain. Our exhaustive analysis covers transactions up to block 760,000, offering a comprehensive insight into CoinJoin transactions and their implications for Bitcoin blockchain analysis",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have enabled high-fidelity scene reconstruction for novel view synthesis. However, NeRF requires hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral, making it slow to train. Caching NeRFs into explicit data structures can effectively enhance rendering speed but at the cost of higher memory usage. To address these issues, we present Hyb-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field with a multi-resolution hybrid encoding that achieves efficient neural modeling and fast rendering, which also allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The key idea of Hyb-NeRF is to represent the scene using different encoding strategies from coarse-to-fine resolution levels. Hyb-NeRF exploits memory-efficiency learnable positional features at coarse resolutions and the fast optimization speed and local details of hash-based feature grids at fine resolutions. In addition, to further boost performance, we embed cone tracing-based features in our learnable positional encoding that eliminates encoding ambiguity and reduces aliasing artifacts. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Hyb-NeRF achieves faster rendering speed with better rending quality and even a lower memory footprint in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Calibration of machine learning classifiers is necessary to obtain reliable and interpretable predictions, bridging the gap between model confidence and actual probabilities. One prominent technique, isotonic regression (IR), aims at calibrating binary classifiers by minimizing the cross entropy on a calibration set via monotone transformations. IR acts as an adaptive binning procedure, which allows achieving a calibration error of zero, but leaves open the issue of the effect on performance. In this paper, we first prove that IR preserves the convex hull of the ROC curve -- an essential performance metric for binary classifiers. This ensures that a classifier is calibrated while controlling for overfitting of the calibration set. We then present a novel generalization of isotonic regression to accommodate classifiers with K classes. Our method constructs a multidimensional adaptive binning scheme on the probability simplex, again achieving a multi-class calibration error equal to zero. We regularize this algorithm by imposing a form of monotony that preserves the K-dimensional ROC surface of the classifier. We show empirically that this general monotony criterion is effective in striking a balance between reducing cross entropy loss and avoiding overfitting of the calibration set",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, the raise in the usage and efficiency of Artificial Intelligence and, more in general, of Automated Decision-Making systems has brought with it an increasing and welcome awareness of the risks associated with such systems. One of such risks is that of perpetuating or even amplifying bias and unjust disparities present in the data from which many of these systems learn to adjust and optimise their decisions. This awareness has on one side encouraged several scientific communities to come up with more and more appropriate ways and methods to assess, quantify, and possibly mitigate such biases and disparities. On the other hand, it has prompted more and more layers of society, including policy makers, to call for ``fair'' algorithms. We believe that while a lot of excellent and multidisciplinary research is currently being conducted, what is still fundamentally missing is the awareness that having ``fair'' algorithms is per s\\'e a nearly meaningless requirement, that needs to be complemented with a lot of additional societal choices to become actionable. Namely, there is a hiatus between what the society is demanding from Automated Decision-Making systems, and what this demand actually means in real-world scenarios. In this work, we outline the key features of such a hiatus, and pinpoint a list of fundamental ambiguities and attention points that we as a society must address in order to give a concrete meaning to the increasing demand of fairness in Automated Decision-Making systems",

    "abstract": "Our work focuses on tackling large-scale fine-grained image retrieval as ranking the images depicting the concept of interests (i.e., the same sub-category labels) highest based on the fine-grained details in the query. It is desirable to alleviate the challenges of both fine-grained nature of small inter-class variations with large intra-class variations and explosive growth of fine-grained data for such a practical task. In this paper, we propose attribute-aware hashing networks with self-consistency for generating attribute-aware hash codes to not only make the retrieval process efficient, but also establish explicit correspondences between hash codes and visual attributes. Specifically, based on the captured visual representations by attention, we develop an encoder-decoder structure network of a reconstruction task to unsupervisedly distill high-level attribute-specific vectors from the appearance-specific visual representations without attribute annotations. Our models are also equipped with a feature decorrelation constraint upon these attribute vectors to strengthen their representative abilities. Then, driven by preserving original entities' similarity, the required hash codes can be generated from these attribute-specific vectors and thus become attribute-aware. Furthermore, to combat simplicity bias in deep hashing, we consider the model design from the perspective of the self-consistency principle and propose to further enhance models' self-consistency by equipping an additional image reconstruction path. Comprehensive quantitative experiments under diverse empirical settings on six fine-grained retrieval datasets and two generic retrieval datasets show the superiority of our models over competing methods",

In this work, we apply classical and deep-learning modelling techniques to the 2016, 2017 and 2019 Moonboard datasets, achieving state of the art grade prediction performance with 0.87 MAE and 1.12 RMSE. We achieve this performance on a feature-set that does not require decomposing routes into individual moves, which is a method common in literature and introduces bias. We also demonstrate the generalization capability of this model between editions and introduce a novel vision-based method of grade prediction. While the generalization performance of these techniques is below human level performance currently, we propose these methods as a basis for future work. Such a tool could be implemented in pre-existing mobile applications and would allow climbers to better track their progress and assess new routes with reduced bias",

    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates.

The system requires no external large language model assistance at test time, making it more convenient for practical applications. Experiments on the Visual Genome and the OpenImage V6 datasets demonstrate that harnessing hierarchical relationships enhances the model performance by a large margin.

Recent works have investigated adopting 8-bit floating-point quantization (FP8) in the context of PTQ for model inference. However, the exploration of floating-point formats smaller than 8 bits and their comparison with integer quantization remains relatively limited. In this work, we present minifloats, which are reduced-precision floating-point formats capable of further reducing the memory footprint, latency, and energy cost of a model while approaching full-precision model accuracy. Our work presents a novel PTQ design-space exploration, comparing minifloat and integer quantization schemes across a range of 3 to 8 bits for both weights and activations. We examine the applicability of various PTQ techniques to minifloats, including weight equalization, bias correction, SmoothQuant, gradient-based learned rounding, and the GPTQ method. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of low-precision minifloats when compared to their integer counterparts across a spectrum of accuracy-precision trade-offs on a set of reference deep learning vision workloads.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) on heterogeneous data (non-IID data) has recently received great attention. Most existing methods focus on studying the convergence guarantees for the global objective. While these methods can guarantee the decrease of the global objective in each communication round, they fail to ensure risk decrease for each client. In this paper, to address the problem,we propose FedCOME, which introduces a consensus mechanism to enforce decreased risk for each client after each training round. In particular, we allow a slight adjustment to a client's gradient on the server side, which generates an acute angle between the corrected gradient and the original ones of other clients. We theoretically show that the consensus mechanism can guarantee the convergence of the global objective. To generalize the consensus mechanism to the partial participation FL scenario, we devise a novel client sampling strategy to select the most representative clients for the global data distribution. Training on these selected clients with the consensus mechanism could empirically lead to risk decrease for clients that are not selected. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets to show the superiority of FedCOME against other state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite their popularity across a wide range of domains, regression neural networks are prone to overfitting complex datasets. In this work, we propose a loss function termed Random Linear Projections (RLP) loss, which is empirically shown to mitigate overfitting. With RLP loss, the distance between sets of hyperplanes connecting fixed-size subsets of the neural network's feature-prediction pairs and feature-label pairs is minimized. The intuition behind this loss derives from the notion that if two functions share the same hyperplanes connecting all subsets of feature-label pairs, then these functions must necessarily be equivalent. Our empirical studies, conducted across benchmark datasets and representative synthetic examples, demonstrate the improvements of the proposed RLP loss over mean squared error (MSE). Specifically, neural networks trained with the RLP loss achieve better performance while requiring fewer data samples and are more robust to additive noise. We provide theoretical analysis supporting our empirical findings",

    "title": "Utilizing Language Models for Tour Itinerary Recommendation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Tour itinerary recommendation involves planning a sequence of relevant Point-of-Interest (POIs), which combines challenges from the fields of both Operations Research (OR) and Recommendation Systems (RS). As an OR problem, there is the need to maximize a certain utility (e.g., popularity of POIs in the tour) while adhering to some constraints (e.g., maximum time for the tour). As a RS problem, it is heavily related to problem or filtering or ranking a subset of POIs that are relevant to a user and recommending it as part of an itinerary. In this paper, we explore the use of language models for the task of tour itinerary recommendation and planning. This task has the unique requirement of recommending personalized POIs relevant to users and planning these POIs as an itinerary that satisfies various constraints. We discuss some approaches in this area, such as using word embedding techniques like Word2Vec and GloVe for learning POI embeddings and transformer-based techniques like BERT for generating itineraries",

    "title": "Advancing Transformer Architecture in Long-Context Large Language Models: A Comprehensive Survey",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the bomb ignited by ChatGPT, Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved a revolutionary path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and have been applied in diverse areas as knowledge bases, human interfaces, and dynamic agents. However, a prevailing limitation exists: many current LLMs, constrained by resources, are primarily pre-trained on shorter texts, rendering them less effective for longer-context prompts, commonly encountered in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey focusing on the advancement of model architecture in Transformer-based LLMs to optimize long-context capabilities across all stages from pre-training to inference. We firstly delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. Then, we mainly offer a holistic taxonomy to navigate the landscape of Transformer upgrades on architecture to solve these problems. Afterward, we provide the investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as some amazing optimization toolkits like libraries, systems, and compilers to augment LLMs' efficiency and efficacy across different stages. Finally, we further discuss the predominant challenges and potential avenues for future research in this domain. Additionally, we have established a repository where we curate relevant literature with real-time updates at https://github.com/Strivin0311/long-llms-learning",

    "abstract": "Aerial object detection is a challenging task, in which one major obstacle lies in the limitations of large-scale data collection and the long-tail distribution of certain classes. Synthetic data offers a promising solution, especially with recent advances in diffusion-based methods like stable diffusion (SD). However, the direct application of diffusion methods to aerial domains poses unique challenges: stable diffusion's optimization for rich ground-level semantics doesn't align with the sparse nature of aerial objects, and the extraction of post-synthesis object coordinates remains problematic. To address these challenges, we introduce a synthetic data augmentation framework tailored for aerial images. It encompasses sparse-to-dense region of interest (ROI) extraction to bridge the semantic gap, fine-tuning the diffusion model with low-rank adaptation (LORA) to circumvent exhaustive retraining, and finally, a Copy-Paste method to compose synthesized objects with backgrounds, providing a nuanced approach to aerial object detection through synthetic data",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) are widely considered state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Although several GCN-based methods have been proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, they can be computationally expensive and time-consuming to train if too many layers are created. However, since the linear GCN model can be interpreted as a differential equation, it is possible to transfer it to an ODE problem. This inspired us to address the computational limitations of GCN-based models by designing a simple and efficient NODE-based model that can skip some GCN layers to reach the final state, thus avoiding the need to create many layers. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation-based method for Collaborative Filtering (GODE-CF). This method estimates the final embedding by utilizing the information captured by one or two GCN layers. To validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive baselines, including GCN-based models and other state-of-the-art CF methods. Notably, our proposed GODE-CF model has several advantages over traditional GCN-based models. It is simple, efficient, and has a fast training time, making it a practical choice for real-world situations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab and Twitter",

Secondly, it is difficult for the model of the platform system to distinguish sentence pairs that are literally close but semantically different, i.e., hard negative samples. In this paper, we propose an incorporation external keywords matrices model (IEKM) to address these challenges. The model uses external tools or dictionaries to construct external matrices and fuses them to the self-attention layers of the Transformer structure through gating units, thus enabling flexible corrections to the model results. We evaluate the method on multiple datasets and the results show that our method has improved performance on all datasets. To demonstrate that our method can effectively solve all the above challenges, we conduct a flexible correction experiment, which results in an increase in the F1 value from 56.61 to 73.53.

To conduct principled risk analysis, numerous Monte Carlo (MC) samples are drawn from the (foretasted) probability distributions of spatio-temporally correlated stochastic grid variables. The corresponding OPF and SCUC solutions, which are needed to quantify the risk, are generated using traditional OPF and SCUC solvers to generate data for training GNN model(s). The GNN model performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of predicting quantities of interests (QoIs) derived from the decision variables in OPF and SCUC. Specifically, we focus on thermal power generation and load shedding at system and individual zone level. We also perform reliability and risk quantification based on GNN predictions and compare with that obtained from OPF/SCUC solutions. Our results demonstrate that GNNs are capable of providing fast and accurate prediction of QoIs and thus can be good surrogate models for OPF and SCUC. The excellent accuracy of GNN-based reliability and risk assessment further suggests that GNN surrogate has the potential to be applied in real-time and hours-ahead risk quantification",

An evolutionary search process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific locations.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing \"Brain Coral\" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain.

This pretraining phase enables a probabilistic similarity metric, which assesses the likelihood of a univariate sample being closely related to one of the pretraining datasets. Subsequently, using this similarity metric as a guide, we propose a fine-tuning procedure designed to enhance the accurate prediction of the target data by aligning it more closely with the learned dynamics of the pretraining datasets.

While existing works are able to prove full identifiability of the underlying data generating process, they typically assume access to single-node, hard interventions which is rather unrealistic in practice. The main contribution of this paper is characterize a notion of identifiability which is provably the best one can achieve when hard interventions are not available. First, for linear causal models, we provide identifiability guarantee for data observed from general environments without assuming any similarities between them. While the causal graph is shown to be fully recovered, the latent variables are only identified up to an effect-domination ambiguity (EDA). We then propose an algorithm, LiNGCReL which is guaranteed to recover the ground-truth model up to EDA, and we demonstrate its effectiveness via numerical experiments. Moving on to general non-parametric causal models, we prove the same idenfifiability guarantee assuming access to groups of soft interventions. Finally, we provide counterparts of our identifiability results, indicating that EDA is basically inevitable in our setting",

This paper (1) presents resilient control design in presence of adversarial cyber-events, and proposes a novel federated reinforcement learning (Fed-RL) approach to tackle (a) model complexities, unknown dynamical behaviors of IBR devices, (b) privacy issues regarding data sharing in multi-party-owned networked grids, and (2) transfers learned controls from simulation to hardware-in-the-loop test-bed, thereby bridging the gap between simulation and real world. With these multi-prong objectives, first, we formulate a reinforcement learning (RL) training setup generating episodic trajectories with adversaries (attack signal) injected at the primary controllers of the grid forming (GFM) inverters where RL agents (or controllers) are being trained to mitigate the injected attacks. For networked microgrids, the horizontal Fed-RL method involving distinct independent environments is not appropriate, leading us to develop vertical variant Federated Soft Actor-Critic (FedSAC) algorithm to grasp the interconnected dynamics of networked microgrid. Next, utilizing OpenAI Gym interface, we built a custom simulation set-up in GridLAB-D/HELICS co-simulation platform, named Resilient RL Co-simulation (ResRLCoSIM), to train the RL agents with IEEE 123-bus benchmark test systems comprising 3 interconnected microgrids. Finally, the learned policies in simulation world are transferred to the real-time hardware-in-the-loop test-bed set-up developed using high-fidelity Hypersim platform.

Diverging from this trend, in this study, we analyze real-world human driving trajectories, extracting a wide range of acceleration behaviors during car-following. We then incorporate these behaviors in simulation where RVs from prior studies are employed to mitigate congestion, and evaluate their safety, efficiency, and stability.

We then analyze the accuracy of function value, gradient, and Hessian approximations for such objective functions obtained through interpolation/regression models and neural networks. When compared to interpolation/regression models, neural networks can deliver competitive zero- and first-order approximations (at a high training cost) but underperform on second-order approximation. However, it is shown that combining a neural net activation function with the natural basis for quadratic interpolation/regression can waive the necessity of including cross terms in the natural basis, leading to models with fewer parameters to determine.

    "abstract": "In real-world reinforcement learning problems, the state information is often only partially observable, which breaks the basic assumption in Markov decision processes, and thus, leads to inferior performances. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes have been introduced to explicitly take the issue into account for learning, exploration, and planning, but presenting significant computational and statistical challenges. To address these difficulties, we exploit the representation view, which leads to a coherent design framework for a practically tractable reinforcement learning algorithm upon partial observations. We provide a theoretical analysis for justifying the statistical efficiency of the proposed algorithm. We also empirically demonstrate the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art performance with partial observations across various benchmarks, therefore, pushing reliable reinforcement learning towards more practical applications",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of designing a data-driven feedback controller for complex nonlinear dynamical systems in the presence of time-varying disturbances with unknown dynamics. Such disturbances are modeled as the \"unknown\" part of the system dynamics. The goal is to achieve finite-time regulation of system states through direct policy updates while also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven stabilization or system identification. First, we expand upon the notion of \"regularizability\" and characterize this system characteristic for a linear time-varying representation of the nonlinear system with locally-bounded higher-order terms. \"Rapid-regularizability\" then gauges the extent by which a system can be regulated in finite time, in contrast to its asymptotic behavior. We then propose the Data-Guided Regulation for Adaptive Nonlinear Control ( DG-RAN) algorithm, an online iterative synthesis procedure that utilizes discrete time-series data from a single trajectory for regulating system states and identifying disturbance dynamics. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on a 6-DOF power descent guidance problem in the presence of adverse environmental disturbances",

We implement FIP for the first time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget. Our FFIP implementation for non-sparse ML models with 8 to 16-bit fixed-point inputs achieves higher throughput and compute efficiency than the best-in-class prior solutions on the same type of compute platform",

We show uniform approximation guarantees for the proposed unbiased estimator of the signature kernel, while keeping its computation linear in the sequence length and number. In addition, combined with recent advances on tensor projections, we derive two even more scalable time series features with favourable concentration properties and computational complexity both in time and memory. Our empirical results show that the reduction in computational cost comes at a negligible price in terms of accuracy on moderate-sized datasets, and it enables one to scale to large datasets up to a million time series",

Despite its success, previous studies showed that PIT is plagued by excessive label assignment switching in adjacent epochs, impeding the model to learn better label assignments. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy, dynamic sample dropout (DSD), which considers previous best label assignments and evaluation metrics to exclude the samples that may negatively impact the learned label assignments during training. Additionally, we include layer-wise optimization (LO) to improve the performance by solving layer-decoupling. Our experiments showed that combining DSD and LO outperforms the baseline and solves excessive label assignment switching and layer-decoupling issues. The proposed DSD and LO approach is easy to implement, requires no extra training sets or steps, and shows generality to various speech separation tasks",

Other methods that produce a distribution over node label assignment in trees (or more generally in graphs) either assume conditional independence of the label assignment, operate on a fixed graph topology, or require part of the node labels to be observed. Our method defines a Markov Network with the corresponding topology of the random tree and an associated Gibbs distribution. We parameterize the Gibbs distribution with a Graph Neural Network that operates on the random tree and the node embeddings. This allows us to estimate the likelihood of node assignments for a given random tree and use MCMC to sample from the distribution of node assignments. We evaluate our method on the tasks of node classification in trees on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.

The results demonstrate that the model can successfully create minutely interval temporally-correlated instantaneous power injection profiles from 15-minute average power consumption information.

    "abstract": "The aim of video summarization is to shorten videos automatically while retaining the key information necessary to convey the overall story. Video summarization methods mainly rely on visual factors, such as visual consecutiveness and diversity, which may not be sufficient to fully understand the content of the video. There are other non-visual factors, such as interestingness, representativeness, and storyline consistency that should also be considered for generating high-quality video summaries. Current methods do not adequately take into account these non-visual factors, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this work, a new approach to video summarization is proposed based on insights gained from how humans create ground truth video summaries. The method utilizes a conditional modeling perspective and introduces multiple meaningful random variables and joint distributions to characterize the key components of video summarization. Helper distributions are employed to improve the training of the model. A conditional attention module is designed to mitigate potential performance degradation in the presence of multi-modal input. The proposed video summarization method incorporates the above innovative design choices that aim to narrow the gap between human-generated and machine-generated video summaries.

    "title": "Hourglass Tokenizer for Efficient Transformer-Based 3D Human Pose Estimation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance, applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M, our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop, respectively.

    "abstract": "We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on adapting RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and moreover enables more aggressive quantization. For example, on the OpenAssistant benchmark LQ-LoRA is able to learn a 2.5-bit LLaMA-2 model that is competitive with a model finetuned with 4-bit QLoRA. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) is competitive with the original model in full precision",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent work in data-driven modeling has demonstrated that a weak formulation of model equations enhances the noise robustness of a wide range of computational methods. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of the weak form to enhance the LaSDI (Latent Space Dynamics Identification) algorithm, a recently developed data-driven reduced order modeling technique. We introduce a weak form-based version WLaSDI (Weak-form Latent Space Dynamics Identification). WLaSDI first compresses data, then projects onto the test functions and learns the local latent space models. Notably, WLaSDI demonstrates significantly enhanced robustness to noise. With WLaSDI, the local latent space is obtained using weak-form equation learning techniques. Compared to the standard sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) used in LaSDI, the variance reduction of the weak form guarantees a robust and precise latent space recovery, hence allowing for a fast, robust, and accurate simulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of WLaSDI vs. LaSDI on several common benchmark examples including viscid and inviscid Burgers', radial advection, and heat conduction. For instance, in the case of 1D inviscid Burgers' simulations with the addition of up to 100% Gaussian white noise, the relative error remains consistently below 6% for WLaSDI, while it can exceed 10,000% for LaSDI. Similarly, for radial advection simulations, the relative errors stay below 15% for WLaSDI, in stark contrast to the potential errors of up to 10,000% with LaSDI. Moreover, speedups of several orders of magnitude can be obtained with WLaSDI. For example applying WLaSDI to 1D Burgers' yields a 140X speedup compared to the corresponding full order model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Designing a perfect reward function that depicts all the aspects of the intended behavior is almost impossible, especially generalizing it outside of the training environments. Active Inverse Reward Design (AIRD) proposed the use of a series of queries, comparing possible reward functions in a single training environment. This allows the human to give information to the agent about suboptimal behaviors, in order to compute a probability distribution over the intended reward function. However, it ignores the possibility of unknown features appearing in real-world environments, and the safety measures needed until the agent completely learns the reward function. I improved this method and created Risk-averse Batch Active Inverse Reward Design (RBAIRD), which constructs batches, sets of environments the agent encounters when being used in the real world, processes them sequentially, and, for a predetermined number of iterations, asks queries that the human needs to answer for each environment of the batch. After this process is completed in one batch, the probabilities have been improved and are transferred to the next batch. This makes it capable of adapting to real-world scenarios and learning how to treat unknown features it encounters for the first time. I also integrated a risk-averse planner, similar to that of Inverse Reward Design (IRD), which samples a set of reward functions from the probability distribution and computes a trajectory that takes the most certain rewards possible. This ensures safety while the agent is still learning the reward function, and enables the use of this approach in situations where cautiousness is vital. RBAIRD outperformed the previous approaches in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and action certainty, demonstrated quick adaptability to new, unknown features, and can be more widely used for the alignment of crucial, powerful AI models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This article focuses on the supervised classification of datasets with a large number of variables and a small number of instances. This is the case, for example, for microarray data sets commonly used in bioinformatics. Complex classifiers that require estimating statistics over many variables are not suitable for this type of data. Probabilistic classifiers with low-order probability tables, e.g. NB and AODE, are good alternatives for dealing with this type of data. AODE usually improves NB in accuracy, but suffers from high spatial complexity since $k$ models, each with $n+1$ variables, are included in the AODE ensemble. In this paper, we propose MiniAnDE, an algorithm that includes only a small number of heterogeneous base classifiers in the ensemble, i.e., each model only includes a different subset of the $k$ predictive variables. Experimental evaluation shows that using MiniAnDE classifiers on microarray data is feasible and outperforms NB and other ensembles such as bagging and random forest",

    "abstract": "Large neural networks pretrained on web-scale corpora are central to modern machine learning. In this paradigm, the distribution of the large, heterogeneous pretraining data rarely matches that of the application domain. This work considers modifying the pretraining distribution in the case where one has a small sample of data reflecting the targeted test conditions. We propose an algorithm motivated by a recent formulation of this setting as an online, bilevel optimization problem. With scalability in mind, our algorithm prioritizes computing gradients at training points which are likely to most improve the loss on the targeted distribution. Empirically, we show that in some cases this approach is beneficial over existing strategies from the domain adaptation literature but may not succeed in other cases.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We study risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning (RL), where we aim to maximize the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) with a fixed risk tolerance $\\tau$. Prior theoretical work studying risk-sensitive RL focuses on the tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) setting. To extend CVaR RL to settings where state space is large, function approximation must be deployed. We study CVaR RL in low-rank MDPs with nonlinear function approximation. Low-rank MDPs assume the underlying transition kernel admits a low-rank decomposition, but unlike prior linear models, low-rank MDPs do not assume the feature or state-action representation is known. We propose a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) bonus-driven algorithm to carefully balance the interplay between exploration, exploitation, and representation learning in CVaR RL. We prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{H^7 A^2 d^4}{\\tau^2 \\epsilon^2}\\right)$ to yield an $\\epsilon$-optimal CVaR, where $H$ is the length of each episode, $A$ is the capacity of action space, and $d$ is the dimension of representations. Computational-wise, we design a novel discretized Least-Squares Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm for the CVaR objective as the planning oracle and show that we can find the near-optimal policy in a polynomial running time with a Maximum Likelihood Estimation oracle. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient CVaR RL algorithm in low-rank MDPs",

    "title": "What Can AutoML Do For Continual Learning?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This position paper outlines the potential of AutoML for incremental (continual) learning to encourage more research in this direction. Incremental learning involves incorporating new data from a stream of tasks and distributions to learn enhanced deep representations and adapt better to new tasks. However, a significant limitation of incremental learners is that most current techniques freeze the backbone architecture, hyperparameters, and the order & structure of the learning tasks throughout the learning and adaptation process. We strongly believe that AutoML offers promising solutions to address these limitations, enabling incremental learning to adapt to more diverse real-world tasks. Therefore, instead of directly proposing a new method, this paper takes a step back by posing the question: \"What can AutoML do for incremental learning?\" We outline three key areas of research that can contribute to making incremental learners more dynamic, highlighting concrete opportunities to apply AutoML methods in novel ways as well as entirely new challenges for AutoML research",

    "title": "NNG-Mix: Improving Semi-supervised Anomaly Detection with Pseudo-anomaly Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection (AD) is essential in identifying rare and often critical events in complex systems, finding applications in fields such as network intrusion detection, financial fraud detection, and fault detection in infrastructure and industrial systems. While AD is typically treated as an unsupervised learning task due to the high cost of label annotation, it is more practical to assume access to a small set of labeled anomaly samples from domain experts, as is the case for semi-supervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised and supervised approaches can leverage such labeled data, resulting in improved performance. In this paper, rather than proposing a new semi-supervised or supervised approach for AD, we introduce a novel algorithm for generating additional pseudo-anomalies on the basis of the limited labeled anomalies and a large volume of unlabeled data. This serves as an augmentation to facilitate the detection of new anomalies. Our proposed algorithm, named Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Mixup (NNG-Mix), efficiently integrates information from both labeled and unlabeled data to generate pseudo-anomalies. We compare the performance of this novel algorithm with commonly applied augmentation techniques, such as Mixup and Cutout. We evaluate NNG-Mix by training various existing semi-supervised and supervised anomaly detection algorithms on the original training data along with the generated pseudo-anomalies. Through extensive experiments on 57 benchmark datasets in ADBench, reflecting different data types, we demonstrate that NNG-Mix outperforms other data augmentation methods. It yields significant performance improvements compared to the baselines trained exclusively on the original training data. Notably, NNG-Mix yields up to 16.4%, 8.8%, and 8.0% improvements on Classical, CV, and NLP datasets in ADBench. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/donghao51/NNG-Mix",

    "title": "Correlated Attention in Transformers for Multivariate Time Series",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) analysis prevails in real-world applications such as finance, climate science and healthcare. The various self-attention mechanisms, the backbone of the state-of-the-art Transformer-based models, efficiently discover the temporal dependencies, yet cannot well capture the intricate cross-correlation between different features of MTS data, which inherently stems from complex dynamical systems in practice. To this end, we propose a novel correlated attention mechanism, which not only efficiently captures feature-wise dependencies, but can also be seamlessly integrated within the encoder blocks of existing well-known Transformers to gain efficiency improvement. In particular, correlated attention operates across feature channels to compute cross-covariance matrices between queries and keys with different lag values, and selectively aggregate representations at the sub-series level. This architecture facilitates automated discovery and representation learning of not only instantaneous but also lagged cross-correlations, while inherently capturing time series auto-correlation. When combined with prevalent Transformer baselines, correlated attention mechanism constitutes a better alternative for encoder-only architectures, which are suitable for a wide range of tasks including imputation, anomaly detection and classification. Extensive experiments on the aforementioned tasks consistently underscore the advantages of correlated attention mechanism in enhancing base Transformer models, and demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in imputation, anomaly detection and classification",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating entropy-regularized optimal transport (EOT) maps with squared-Euclidean cost between source and target measures that are subGaussian. In the case that the target measure is compactly supported or strongly log-concave, we show that for a recently proposed in-sample estimator, the expected squared $L^2$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/3})$ where $n$ is the sample size. For the general subGaussian case we show that the expected $L^1$-error decays at least as fast as $O(n^{-1/6})$, and in both cases we have polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter. While these results are suboptimal compared to known results in the case of compactness of both the source and target measures (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1})$) and for when the source is subGaussian while the target is compactly supported (squared $L^2$-error converging at a rate $O(n^{-1/2})$), their importance lie in eliminating the compact support requirements. The proof technique makes use of a bias-variance decomposition where the variance is controlled using standard concentration of measure results and the bias is handled by T1-transport inequalities along with sample complexity results in estimation of EOT cost under subGaussian assumptions. Our experimental results point to a looseness in controlling the variance terms and we conclude by posing several open problems",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives: By extracting this information, Machine or Deep Learning (ML/DL)-based autonomous data analysis tools can assist clinicians and cancer researchers in discovering patterns and relationships from complex data sets. Many DL-based analyses on ovarian cancer (OC) data have recently been published. These analyses are highly diverse in various aspects of cancer (e.g., subdomain(s) and cancer type they address) and data analysis features. However, a comprehensive understanding of these analyses in terms of these features and AI assurance (AIA) is currently lacking. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by examining the existing literature and identifying important aspects of OC data analysis using DL, explicitly focusing on the key features and AI assurance perspectives. Methods: The PRISMA framework was used to conduct comprehensive searches in three journal databases. Only studies published between 2015 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals were included in the analysis. Results: In the review, a total of 96 DL-driven analyses were examined. The findings reveal several important insights regarding DL-driven ovarian cancer data analysis: - Most studies 71% (68 out of 96) focused on detection and diagnosis, while no study addressed the prediction and prevention of OC. - The analyses were predominantly based on samples from a non-diverse population (75% (72/96 studies)), limited to a geographic location or country. - Only a small proportion of studies (only 33% (32/96)) performed integrated analyses, most of which used homogeneous data (clinical or omics). - Notably, a mere 8.3% (8/96) of the studies validated their models using external and diverse data sets, highlighting the need for enhanced model validation, and - The inclusion of AIA in cancer data analysis is in a very early stage; only 2.1% (2/96) explicitly addressed AIA through explainability",

    "abstract": "Providing formal guarantees of algorithmic fairness is of paramount importance to socially responsible deployment of machine learning algorithms. In this work, we study formal guarantees, i.e., certificates, for individual fairness (IF) of neural networks. We start by introducing a novel convex approximation of IF constraints that exponentially decreases the computational cost of providing formal guarantees of local individual fairness. We highlight that prior methods are constrained by their focus on global IF certification and can therefore only scale to models with a few dozen hidden neurons, thus limiting their practical impact. We propose to certify distributional individual fairness which ensures that for a given empirical distribution and all distributions within a $\\gamma$-Wasserstein ball, the neural network has guaranteed individually fair predictions. Leveraging developments in quasi-convex optimization, we provide novel and efficient certified bounds on distributional individual fairness and show that our method allows us to certify and regularize neural networks that are several orders of magnitude larger than those considered by prior works. Moreover, we study real-world distribution shifts and find our bounds to be a scalable, practical, and sound source of IF guarantees",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is a sub-field of machine learning, which aims to allow machine learning models to continuously learn on new data, by accumulating knowledge without forgetting what was learned in the past. In this work, we take a step back, and ask: \"Why should one care about continual learning in the first place?\". We set the stage by surveying recent continual learning papers published at three major machine learning conferences, and show that memory-constrained settings dominate the field. Then, we discuss five open problems in machine learning, and even though they seem unrelated to continual learning at first sight, we show that continual learning will inevitably be part of their solution. These problems are model-editing, personalization, on-device learning, faster (re-)training and reinforcement learning. Finally, by comparing the desiderata from these unsolved problems and the current assumptions in continual learning, we highlight and discuss four future directions for continual learning research. We hope that this work offers an interesting perspective on the future of continual learning, while displaying its potential value and the paths we have to pursue in order to make it successful.

    "abstract": "Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) are crucial in modern air defense systems. A critical aspect of their effectiveness is the Engagement Zone (EZ), the spatial region within which a SAM can effectively engage and neutralize a target. Notably, the EZ is intrinsically related to the missile's maximum range; it defines the furthest distance at which a missile can intercept a target. The accurate computation of this EZ is essential but challenging due to the dynamic and complex factors involved, which often lead to high computational costs and extended processing times when using conventional simulation methods. In light of these challenges, our study investigates the potential of machine learning techniques, proposing an approach that integrates machine learning with a custom-designed simulation tool to train supervised algorithms. We leverage a comprehensive dataset of pre-computed SAM EZ simulations, enabling our model to accurately predict the SAM EZ for new input parameters. It accelerates SAM EZ simulations, enhances air defense strategic planning, and provides real-time insights, improving SAM system performance. The study also includes a comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms, illuminating their capabilities and performance metrics and suggesting areas for future research, highlighting the transformative potential of machine learning in SAM EZ simulations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also highlight the resulting descriptions serve as explainable and robust features that can consistently improve the performance across various backbone models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The non-life insurance sector operates within a highly competitive and tightly regulated framework, confronting a pivotal juncture in the formulation of pricing strategies. Insurers are compelled to harness a range of statistical methodologies and available data to construct optimal pricing structures that align with the overarching corporate strategy while accommodating the dynamics of market competition. Given the fundamental societal role played by insurance, premium rates are subject to rigorous scrutiny by regulatory authorities. These rates must conform to principles of transparency, explainability, and ethical considerations. Consequently, the act of pricing transcends mere statistical calculations and carries the weight of strategic and societal factors. These multifaceted concerns may drive insurers to establish equitable premiums, taking into account various variables. For instance, regulations mandate the provision of equitable premiums, considering factors such as policyholder gender or mutualist group dynamics in accordance with respective corporate strategies. Age-based premium fairness is also mandated. In certain insurance domains, variables such as the presence of serious illnesses or disabilities are emerging as new dimensions for evaluating fairness. Regardless of the motivating factor prompting an insurer to adopt fairer pricing strategies for a specific variable, the insurer must possess the capability to define, measure, and ultimately mitigate any ethical biases inherent in its pricing practices while upholding standards of consistency and performance. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive set of tools for these endeavors and assess their effectiveness through practical application in the context of automobile insurance",

Latent graph inference addresses this issue by enabling Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to operate on point cloud data, dynamically learning the necessary graph structure. These graphs are often derived from a latent embedding space, which can be modeled using Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical, or product spaces. However, currently, there is no principled differentiable method for determining the optimal embedding space. In this work, we introduce the Attentional Multi-Embedding Selection (AMES) framework, a differentiable method for selecting the best embedding space for latent graph inference through backpropagation, considering a downstream task. Our framework consistently achieves comparable or superior results compared to previous methods for latent graph inference across five benchmark datasets. Importantly, our approach eliminates the need for conducting multiple experiments to identify the optimal embedding space. Furthermore, we explore interpretability techniques that track the gradient contributions of different latent graphs, shedding light on how our attention-based, fully differentiable approach learns to choose the appropriate latent space. In line with previous works, our experiments emphasize the advantages of hyperbolic spaces in enhancing performance. More importantly, our interpretability framework provides a general approach for quantitatively comparing embedding spaces across different tasks based on their contributions, a dimension that has been overlooked in previous literature on latent graph inference",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human facial data hold tremendous potential to address a variety of classification problems, including face recognition, age estimation, gender identification, emotion analysis, and race classification. However, recent privacy regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and others, have restricted the ways in which human images may be collected and used for research. As a result, several previously published data sets containing human faces have been removed from the internet due to inadequate data collection methods that failed to meet privacy regulations. Data sets consisting of synthetic data have been proposed as an alternative, but they fall short of accurately representing the real data distribution. On the other hand, most available data sets are labeled for just a single task, which limits their applicability. To address these issues, we present the Multi-Task Faces (MTF) image data set, a meticulously curated collection of face images designed for various classification tasks, including face recognition, as well as race, gender, and age classification. The MTF data set has been ethically gathered by leveraging publicly available images of celebrities and strictly adhering to copyright regulations. In this paper, we present this data set and provide detailed descriptions of the followed data collection and processing procedures. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of five deep learning (DL) models on the MTF data set across the aforementioned classification tasks. Additionally, we compare the performance of DL models over the processed MTF data and over raw data crawled from the internet. The reported results constitute a baseline for further research employing these data.

    "title": "Forward Gradients for Data-Driven CFD Wall Modeling",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used in the design and optimization of gas turbines and many other industrial/ scientific applications. However, the practical use is often limited by the high computational cost, and the accurate resolution of near-wall flow is a significant contributor to this cost. Machine learning (ML) and other data-driven methods can complement existing wall models. Nevertheless, training these models is bottlenecked by the large computational effort and memory footprint demanded by back-propagation. Recent work has presented alternatives for computing gradients of neural networks where a separate forward and backward sweep is not needed and storage of intermediate results between sweeps is not required because an unbiased estimator for the gradient is computed in a single forward sweep. In this paper, we discuss the application of this approach for training a subgrid wall model that could potentially be used as a surrogate in wall-bounded flow CFD simulations to reduce the computational overhead while preserving predictive accuracy",

    "title": "Explaining Deep Learning Models for Age-related Gait Classification based on time series acceleration",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Gait analysis holds significant importance in monitoring daily health, particularly among older adults. Advancements in sensor technology enable the capture of movement in real-life environments and generate big data. Machine learning, notably deep learning (DL), shows promise to use these big data in gait analysis. However, the inherent black-box nature of these models poses challenges for their clinical application. This study aims to enhance transparency in DL-based gait classification for aged-related gait patterns using Explainable Artificial Intelligence, such as SHAP. A total of 244 subjects, comprising 129 adults and 115 older adults (age>65), were included. They performed a 3-minute walking task while accelerometers were affixed to the lumbar segment L3. DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was employed to explain the models' predictions. CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4% and an AUC of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5% and an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally. CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between different age groups",

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness and generalization are both crucial properties of reliable machine learning models. In this paper, we study these properties in the context of quantum machine learning based on Lipschitz bounds. We derive tailored, parameter-dependent Lipschitz bounds for quantum models with trainable encoding, showing that the norm of the data encoding has a crucial impact on the robustness against perturbations in the input data. Further, we derive a bound on the generalization error which explicitly depends on the parameters of the data encoding. Our theoretical findings give rise to a practical strategy for training robust and generalizable quantum models by regularizing the Lipschitz bound in the cost. Further, we show that, for fixed and non-trainable encodings as frequently employed in quantum machine learning, the Lipschitz bound cannot be influenced by tuning the parameters. Thus, trainable encodings are crucial for systematically adapting robustness and generalization during training. With numerical results, we demonstrate that, indeed, Lipschitz bound regularization leads to substantially more robust and generalizable quantum models",

    "title": "Establishing Central Sensitization Inventory Cut-off Values in patients with Chronic Low Back Pain by Unsupervised Machine Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Human Assumed Central Sensitization is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic low back pain (CLBP). The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) was developed to evaluate the presence of HACS, with a cut-off value of 40/100 based on patients with chronic pain. However, various factors including pain conditions (e.g., CLBP), and gender may influence this cut-off value. For chronic pain condition such as CLBP, unsupervised clustering approaches can take these factors into consideration and automatically learn the HACS-related patterns. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the cut-off values for a Dutch-speaking population with CLBP, considering the total group and stratified by gender based on unsupervised machine learning. In this study, questionnaire data covering pain, physical, and psychological aspects were collected from patients with CLBP and aged-matched pain-free adults (referred to as healthy controls, HC). Four clustering approaches were applied to identify HACS-related clusters based on the questionnaire data and gender. The clustering performance was assessed using internal and external indicators. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted on the best clustering results to determine the optimal cut-off values. The study included 151 subjects, consisting of 63 HCs and 88 patients with CLBP. Hierarchical clustering yielded the best results, identifying three clusters: healthy group, CLBP with low HACS level, and CLBP with high HACS level groups. Based on the low HACS levels group (including HC and CLBP with low HACS level) and high HACS level group, the cut-off value for the overall groups were 35, 34 for females, and 35 for. The findings suggest that the optimal cut-off values for CLBP is 35. The gender-related cut-off values should be interpreted with caution due to the unbalanced gender distribution in the sample",

    "abstract": "We consider the stochastic gradient method with random reshuffling ($\\mathsf{RR}$) for tackling smooth nonconvex optimization problems. $\\mathsf{RR}$ finds broad applications in practice, notably in training neural networks. In this work, we first investigate the concentration property of $\\mathsf{RR}$'s sampling procedure and establish a new high probability sample complexity guarantee for driving the gradient (without expectation) below $\\varepsilon$, which effectively characterizes the efficiency of a single $\\mathsf{RR}$ execution. Our derived complexity matches the best existing in-expectation one up to a logarithmic term while imposing no additional assumptions nor changing $\\mathsf{RR}$'s updating rule. Furthermore, by leveraging our derived high probability descent property and bound on the stochastic error, we propose a simple and computable stopping criterion for $\\mathsf{RR}$ (denoted as $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$). This criterion is guaranteed to be triggered after a finite number of iterations, and then $\\mathsf{RR}$-$\\mathsf{sc}$ returns an iterate with its gradient below $\\varepsilon$ with high probability. Moreover, building on the proposed stopping criterion, we design a perturbed random reshuffling method ($\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$) that involves an additional randomized perturbation procedure near stationary points. We derive that $\\mathsf{p}$-$\\mathsf{RR}$ provably escapes strict saddle points and efficiently returns a second-order stationary point with high probability, without making any sub-Gaussian tail-type assumptions on the stochastic gradient errors. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on neural network training to support our theoretical findings",

    "title": "Kandinsky Conformal Prediction: Efficient Calibration of Image Segmentation Algorithms",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Image segmentation algorithms can be understood as a collection of pixel classifiers, for which the outcomes of nearby pixels are correlated. Classifier models can be calibrated using Inductive Conformal Prediction, but this requires holding back a sufficiently large calibration dataset for computing the distribution of non-conformity scores of the model's predictions. If one only requires only marginal calibration on the image level, this calibration set consists of all individual pixels in the images available for calibration. However, if the goal is to attain proper calibration for each individual pixel classifier, the calibration set consists of individual images. In a scenario where data are scarce (such as the medical domain), it may not always be possible to set aside sufficiently many images for this pixel-level calibration. The method we propose, dubbed ``Kandinsky calibration'', makes use of the spatial structure present in the distribution of natural images to simultaneously calibrate the classifiers of ``similar'' pixels. This can be seen as an intermediate approach between marginal (imagewise) and conditional (pixelwise) calibration, where non-conformity scores are aggregated over similar image regions, thereby making more efficient use of the images available for calibration. We run experiments on segmentation algorithms trained and calibrated on subsets of the public MS-COCO and Medical Decathlon datasets, demonstrating that Kandinsky calibration method can significantly improve the coverage. When compared to both pixelwise and imagewise calibration on little data, the Kandinsky method achieves much lower coverage errors, indicating the data efficiency of the Kandinsky calibration",

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for improving few-shot segmentation performance on multispectral images using reinforcement learning to generate representations. These representations are generated in the form of mathematical expressions between channels and are tailored to the specific class being segmented. Our methodology involves training an agent to identify the most informative expressions, updating the dataset using these expressions, and then using the updated dataset to perform segmentation. Due to the limited length of the expressions, the model receives useful representations without any added risk of overfitting. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on several multispectral datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting the performance of segmentation algorithms",

However, training these models on billions of parameters is very challenging in terms of the training speed, memory cost, and communication efficiency, especially under the privacy-preserving regime with differential privacy (DP).

On the other hand, the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) is a state-of-the-art solution to the standard distributed learning, exhibiting excellent training efficiency on large models, but to work compatibly with DP is technically complicated. In this work, we develop a new systematic solution, DP-ZeRO, (I) to scale up the trainable DP model size, e.g. to GPT-100B, (II) to obtain the same computation and communication efficiency as the standard ZeRO, and (III) to enable mixed-precision DP training.

Exploring invariant graph representations remains a challenge for most existing graph representation learning methods. In this paper, we propose a cross-view graph consistency learning (CGCL) method that learns invariant graph representations for link prediction. First, two complementary augmented views are derived from an incomplete graph structure through a bidirectional graph structure augmentation scheme. This augmentation scheme mitigates the potential information loss that is commonly associated with various data augmentation techniques involving raw graph data, such as edge perturbation, node removal, and attribute masking. Second, we propose a CGCL model that can learn invariant graph representations. A cross-view training scheme is proposed to train the proposed CGCL model. This scheme attempts to maximize the consistency information between one augmented view and the graph structure reconstructed from the other augmented view. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive theoretical CGCL analysis. This paper empirically and experimentally demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed CGCL method, achieving competitive results on graph datasets in comparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms",

While practical use is limited by spatial resolution and image noise, incorporation of trained super-resolution (SR) networks has potential to enhance image quality post-scan. However, these efforts have predominantly been restricted to narrowly defined cardiovascular domains, with limited exploration of how SR performance extends across the cardiovascular system; a task aggravated by contrasting hemodynamic conditions apparent across the cardiovasculature. The aim of our study was to explore the generalizability of SR 4D Flow MRI using a combination of heterogeneous training sets and dedicated ensemble learning. With synthetic training data generated across three disparate domains (cardiac, aortic, cerebrovascular), varying convolutional base and ensemble learners were evaluated as a function of domain and architecture, quantifying performance on both in-silico and acquired in-vivo data from the same three domains. Results show that both bagging and stacking ensembling enhance SR performance across domains, accurately predicting high-resolution velocities from low-resolution input data in-silico. Likewise, optimized networks successfully recover native resolution velocities from downsampled in-vivo data, as well as show qualitative potential in generating denoised SR-images from clinical level input data. In conclusion, our work presents a viable approach for generalized SR 4D Flow MRI, with ensemble learning extending utility across various clinical areas of interest",

By integrating diverse datasets, log representation methods and anomaly detectors, LogLead facilitates comprehensive benchmarking in log analysis research. We demonstrate that log loading from raw file to dataframe is over 10x faster with LogLead is compared to past solutions. We demonstrate roughly 2x improvement in Drain parsing speed by off-loading log message normalization to LogLead.

We investigate the performance of the spatial-temporal continuous learning framework with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data.

At each decision epoch, all the m agents cooperatively select actions in order to maximize a common long-term objective. Since the number of actions grows exponentially in the number of agents, policy improvement is computationally expensive. Recent works have proposed using decentralized policy improvement in which each agent assumes that the decisions of the other agents are fixed and it improves its decisions unilaterally. Yet, in these works, exact values are computed. In our work, for cooperative multi-agent finite and infinite horizon discounted MDPs, we propose suitable approximate policy iteration algorithms, wherein we use approximate linear programming to compute the approximate value function and use decentralized policy improvement. Thus our algorithms can handle both large number of states as well as multiple agents.

    "abstract": "Segmenting the boundary between tumor and healthy tissue during surgical cancer resection poses a significant challenge. In recent years, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) combined with Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising solution. However, due to the extensive information contained within the spectral domain, most ML approaches primarily classify individual HSI (super-)pixels, or tiles, without taking into account their spatial context. In this paper, we propose an improved methodology that leverages the spatial context of tiles for more robust and smoother segmentation. To address the irregular shapes of tiles, we utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to propagate context information across neighboring regions. The features for each tile within the graph are extracted using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is trained simultaneously with the subsequent GNN. Moreover, we incorporate local image quality metrics into the loss function to enhance the training procedure's robustness against low-quality regions in the training images. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method using a clinical ex vivo dataset consisting of 51 HSI images from 30 patients. Despite the limited dataset, the GNN-based model significantly outperforms context-agnostic approaches, accurately distinguishing between healthy and tumor tissues, even in images from previously unseen patients. Furthermore, we show that our carefully designed loss function, accounting for local image quality, results in additional improvements. Our findings demonstrate that context-aware GNN algorithms can robustly find tumor demarcations on HSI images, ultimately contributing to better surgery success and patient outcome",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The integration of multisource remote sensing data and deep learning models offers new possibilities for accurately mapping high spatial resolution forest height. We found that GEDI relative heights (RH) metrics exhibited strong correlation with the mean of the top 10 highest trees (dominant height) measured in situ at the corresponding footprint locations. Consequently, we proposed a novel deep learning framework termed the multi-modal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to estimate forest dominant height by extrapolating dominant height derived from GEDI, using Setinel-1 data, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data, Sentinel-2 optical data and ancillary data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing imagery avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the efficacious information from each dataset, we reduced the prevalent spatial and band redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and band reconstruction convolution modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieved commendable performance in estimating dominant height, with an R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m, outperforming the widely used random forest approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m. Finally, we applied the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrated an R2 of 0.58 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.41 and 4.37 m for the random forest baseline. Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high resolution dominant height estimation",

    "title": "A Good Feature Extractor Is All You Need for Weakly Supervised Learning in Histopathology",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning is revolutionising pathology, offering novel opportunities in disease prognosis and personalised treatment. Historically, stain normalisation has been a crucial preprocessing step in computational pathology pipelines, and persists into the deep learning era. Yet, with the emergence of feature extractors trained using self-supervised learning (SSL) on diverse pathology datasets, we call this practice into question. In an empirical evaluation of publicly available feature extractors, we find that omitting stain normalisation and image augmentations does not compromise downstream performance, while incurring substantial savings in memory and compute. Further, we show that the top-performing feature extractors are remarkably robust to variations in stain and augmentations like rotation in their latent space. Contrary to previous patch-level benchmarking studies, our approach emphasises clinical relevance by focusing on slide-level prediction tasks in a weakly supervised setting with external validation cohorts. This work represents the most comprehensive robustness evaluation of public pathology SSL feature extractors to date, involving more than 6,000 training runs across nine tasks, five datasets, three downstream architectures, and various preprocessing setups. Our findings stand to streamline digital pathology workflows by minimising preprocessing needs and informing the selection of feature extractors",

    "abstract": "Recent studies attempted to utilize multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to solve semi-supervised node classification on graphs, by training a student MLP by knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher graph neural network (GNN). While previous studies have focused mostly on training the student MLP by matching the output probability distributions between the teacher and student models during KD, it has not been systematically studied how to inject the structural information in an explicit and interpretable manner. Inspired by GNNs that separate feature transformation $T$ and propagation $\\Pi$, we re-frame the KD process as enabling the student MLP to explicitly learn both $T$ and $\\Pi$. Although this can be achieved by applying the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$ before distillation from the teacher GNN, it still comes with a high computational cost from large matrix multiplications during training. To solve this problem, we propose Propagate & Distill (P&D), which propagates the output of the teacher GNN before KD and can be interpreted as an approximate process of the inverse propagation $\\Pi^{-1}$. Through comprehensive evaluations using real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of P&D by showing further performance boost of the student MLP",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are increasingly utilized in mobility prediction tasks, yet their intricate internal workings pose challenges for interpretability, especially in comprehending how various aspects of mobility behavior affect predictions. In this study, we introduce a causal intervention framework to assess the impact of mobility-related factors on neural networks designed for next location prediction -- a task focusing on predicting the immediate next location of an individual. To achieve this, we employ individual mobility models to generate synthetic location visit sequences and control behavior dynamics by intervening in their data generation process. We evaluate the interventional location sequences using mobility metrics and input them into well-trained networks to analyze performance variations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness in producing location sequences with distinct mobility behaviors, thus facilitating the simulation of diverse spatial and temporal changes. These changes result in performance fluctuations in next location prediction networks, revealing impacts of critical mobility behavior factors, including sequential patterns in location transitions, proclivity for exploring new locations, and preferences in location choices at population and individual levels. The gained insights hold significant value for the real-world application of mobility prediction networks, and the framework is expected to promote the use of causal inference for enhancing the interpretability and robustness of neural networks in mobility applications",

    "abstract": "Binary classification involves predicting the label of an instance based on whether the model score for the positive class exceeds a threshold chosen based on the application requirements (e.g., maximizing recall for a precision bound). However, model scores are often not aligned with the true positivity rate. This is especially true when the training involves a differential sampling across classes or there is distributional drift between train and test settings. In this paper, we provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence of the dependence of model score estimation bias on both uncertainty and score itself. Further, we formulate the decision boundary selection in terms of both model score and uncertainty, prove that it is NP-hard, and present algorithms based on dynamic programming and isotonic regression. Evaluation of the proposed algorithms on three real-world datasets yield 25%-40% gain in recall at high precision bounds over the traditional approach of using model score alone, highlighting the benefits of leveraging uncertainty",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) is a key property to protect data and models from integrity attacks. In the Deep Learning (DL) field, it is commonly implemented through the Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). However, when a model is shared or released, there is no way to check whether it is differentially private, that is, it required to trust the model provider. This situation poses a problem when data privacy is mandatory, specially with current data regulations, as the presence of DP can not be certificated consistently by any third party. Thus, we face the challenge of determining whether a DL model has been trained with DP, according to the title question: Can we infer the presence of Differential Privacy in Deep Learning models' weights? Since the DP-SGD significantly changes the training process of a DL model, we hypothesize that DP leaves an imprint in the weights of a DL model, which can be used to predict whether a model has been trained with DP regardless of its architecture and the training dataset. In this paper, we propose to employ the imprint in model weights of using DP to infer the presence of DP training in a DL model. To substantiate our hypothesis, we developed an experimental methodology based on two datasets of weights of DL models, each with models with and without DP training and a meta-classifier to infer whether DP was used in the training process of a DL model, by accessing its weights. We accomplish both, the removal of the requirement of a trusted model provider and a strong foundation for this interesting line of research. Thus, our contribution is an additional layer of security on top of the strict private requirements of DP training in DL models, towards to DL models",

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Amazon ships billions of packages to its customers annually within the United States. Shipping cost of these packages are used on the day of shipping (day 0) to estimate profitability of sales. Downstream systems utilize these days 0 profitability estimates to make financial decisions, such as pricing strategies and delisting loss-making products. However, obtaining accurate shipping cost estimates on day 0 is complex for reasons like delay in carrier invoicing or fixed cost components getting recorded at monthly cadence. Inaccurate shipping cost estimates can lead to bad decision, such as pricing items too low or high, or promoting the wrong product to the customers. Current solutions for estimating shipping costs on day 0 rely on tree-based models that require extensive manual engineering efforts. In this study, we propose a novel architecture called the Rate Card Transformer (RCT) that uses self-attention to encode all package shipping information such as package attributes, carrier information and route plan. Unlike other transformer-based tabular models, RCT has the ability to encode a variable list of one-to-many relations of a shipment, allowing it to capture more information about a shipment. For example, RCT can encode properties of all products in a package. Our results demonstrate that cost predictions made by the RCT have 28.82% less error compared to tree-based GBDT model. Moreover, the RCT outperforms the state-of-the-art transformer-based tabular model, FTTransformer, by 6.08%. We also illustrate that the RCT learns a generalized manifold of the rate card that can improve the performance of tree-based models",

Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural networks.

Prediction times for the classification subsystem are lower than 10 and 14 ms for Edge TPUs and Maxwell GPUs, respectively.

Despite the effectiveness of DRL methods, their application demands significant computing resources and prolonged training periods to establish a resilient agent. On the other hand, quantum reinforcement learning algorithms have recently demonstrated faster convergence and improved stability in simple, non-real-world environments. However, their application in the real-world CFN domain has not been explored, and their direct adaptation would require a quantum computing device onboard the vehicle for testing. In this work, we propose Nav-Q, the first quantum-supported DRL algorithm for CFN of self-driving cars, that leverages quantum computation for improving the training performance without the requirement for onboard quantum hardware. Nav-Q is based on the actor-critic approach, where the critic is implemented using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm suitable for near-term quantum devices. We assess the performance of Nav-Q using the CARLA driving simulator, a de facto standard benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art DRL methods. Our empirical evaluations showcase that Nav-Q surpasses its classical counterpart not only in terms of training stability but also, in certain instances, with respect to the convergence rate when analyzing the Reward vs. Episode curve. This enhancement is accomplished without negatively impacting the learned policy by the agent. Furthermore, we assess Nav-Q in relation to effective dimension, unveiling that the incorporation of a quantum component results in a model possessing greater descriptive power compared to classical baselines. Finally, we evaluate the performance of Nav-Q using noisy quantum simulation, observing that the quantum noise enhances the exploratory tendencies of the agent during training",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a key enabler for personalized healthcare, providing a deep dive into the complex protein compositions of biological systems. This technology has vast applications in biotechnology and biomedicine but faces significant computational bottlenecks. Current methodologies often require multiple hours or even days to process extensive datasets, particularly in the domain of spectral clustering. To tackle these inefficiencies, we introduce SpecHD, a hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework supplemented by an FPGA-accelerated architecture with integrated near-storage preprocessing. Utilizing streamlined binary operations in an HDC environment, SpecHD capitalizes on the low-latency and parallel capabilities of FPGAs. This approach markedly improves clustering speed and efficiency, serving as a catalyst for real-time, high-throughput data analysis in future healthcare applications. Our evaluations demonstrate that SpecHD not only maintains but often surpasses existing clustering quality metrics while drastically cutting computational time. Specifically, it can cluster a large-scale human proteome dataset-comprising 25 million MS/MS spectra and 131 GB of MS data-in just 5 minutes. With energy efficiency exceeding 31x and a speedup factor that spans a range of 6x to 54x over existing state of-the-art solutions, SpecHD emerges as a promising solution for the rapid analysis of mass spectrometry data with great implications for personalized healthcare",

Recognizing the sensitivity of the solver to the initial guess selection, we embed a genetic algorithm (GA) into the solver to optimize the selection. We aim to achieve faster convergence for the nonlinear PDEs on a broader interval than deep-BSDE. Our proposed method is applied to two nonlinear parabolic PDEs, i.e., the Black-Scholes (BS) equation with default risk and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. We compare the results of our method with those of the deep-BSDE and show that our method provides comparable accuracy with significantly improved computational efficiency",

    "title": "Replay-enhanced Continual Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Replaying past experiences has proven to be a highly effective approach for averting catastrophic forgetting in supervised continual learning. However, some crucial factors are still largely ignored, making it vulnerable to serious failure, when used as a solution to forgetting in continual reinforcement learning, even in the context of perfect memory where all data of previous tasks are accessible in the current task. On the one hand, since most reinforcement learning algorithms are not invariant to the reward scale, the previously well-learned tasks (with high rewards) may appear to be more salient to the current learning process than the current task (with small initial rewards). This causes the agent to concentrate on those salient tasks at the expense of generality on the current task. On the other hand, offline learning on replayed tasks while learning a new task may induce a distributional shift between the dataset and the learned policy on old tasks, resulting in forgetting. In this paper, we introduce RECALL, a replay-enhanced method that greatly improves the plasticity of existing replay-based methods on new tasks while effectively avoiding the recurrence of catastrophic forgetting in continual reinforcement learning. RECALL leverages adaptive normalization on approximate targets and policy distillation on old tasks to enhance generality and stability, respectively. Extensive experiments on the Continual World benchmark show that RECALL performs significantly better than purely perfect memory replay, and achieves comparable or better overall performance against state-of-the-art continual learning methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Supervised deep learning methods have shown promise in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) undersampling reconstruction, but their requirement for paired data limits their generalizability to the diverse MRI acquisition parameters. Recently, unsupervised controllable generative diffusion models have been applied to MRI undersampling reconstruction, without paired data or model retraining for different MRI acquisitions. However, diffusion models are generally slow in sampling and state-of-the-art acceleration techniques can lead to sub-optimal results when directly applied to the controllable generation process. This study introduces a new algorithm called Predictor-Projector-Noisor (PPN), which enhances and accelerates controllable generation of diffusion models for MRI undersampling reconstruction. Our results demonstrate that PPN produces high-fidelity MR images that conform to undersampled k-space measurements with significantly shorter reconstruction time than other controllable sampling methods. In addition, the unsupervised PPN accelerated diffusion models are adaptable to different MRI acquisition parameters, making them more practical for clinical use than supervised learning techniques",

    "title": "Understanding Variation in Subpopulation Susceptibility to Poisoning Attacks",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Machine learning is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which an attacker controls a small fraction of the training data and chooses that data with the goal of inducing some behavior unintended by the model developer in the trained model. We consider a realistic setting in which the adversary with the ability to insert a limited number of data points attempts to control the model's behavior on a specific subpopulation. Inspired by previous observations on disparate effectiveness of random label-flipping attacks on different subpopulations, we investigate the properties that can impact the effectiveness of state-of-the-art poisoning attacks against different subpopulations. For a family of 2-dimensional synthetic datasets, we empirically find that dataset separability plays a dominant role in subpopulation vulnerability for less separable datasets. However, well-separated datasets exhibit more dependence on individual subpopulation properties. We further discover that a crucial subpopulation property is captured by the difference in loss on the clean dataset between the clean model and a target model that misclassifies the subpopulation, and a subpopulation is much easier to attack if the loss difference is small. This property also generalizes to high-dimensional benchmark datasets. For the Adult benchmark dataset, we show that we can find semantically-meaningful subpopulation properties that are related to the susceptibilities of a selected group of subpopulations. The results in this paper are accompanied by a fully interactive web-based visualization of subpopulation poisoning attacks found at https://uvasrg.github.io/visualizing-poisoning",

In this manuscript, we introduce a new framework based on gradient histograms to analyze and justify important attributes of adaptive optimizers, such as their optimal performance and the relationships and dependencies among hyperparameters.

    "abstract": "In recent days, Deep Learning (DL) techniques have become an emerging transformation in the field of machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and so on. Subsequently, researchers and industries have been highly endorsed in the medical field, predicting and controlling diverse diseases at specific intervals. Liver tumor prediction is a vital chore in analyzing and treating liver diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach for predicting liver tumors using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a depth-based variant search algorithm with advanced attention mechanisms (CNN-DS-AM). The proposed work aims to improve accuracy and robustness in diagnosing and treating liver diseases. The anticipated model is assessed on a Computed Tomography (CT) scan dataset containing both benign and malignant liver tumors. The proposed approach achieved high accuracy in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, advanced attention mechanisms were incorporated into the CNN model to enable the identification and highlighting of regions of the CT scans most relevant to predicting liver tumors. The results suggest that incorporating attention mechanisms and a depth-based variant search algorithm into the CNN model is a promising approach for improving the accuracy and robustness of liver tumor prediction. It can assist radiologists in their diagnosis and treatment planning. The proposed system achieved a high accuracy of 95.5% in predicting liver tumors, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods",

However, these models are susceptible to adversarial prompt attacks, where attackers can carefully curate input strings that lead to undesirable outputs. The inherent vulnerability of LLMs stems from their input-output mechanisms, especially when presented with intensely out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This paper proposes a token-level detection method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences. As a result, we propose two methods: one that identifies each token as either being part of an adversarial prompt or not, and another that estimates the probability of each token being part of an adversarial prompt",

    "abstract": "LoRA achieves remarkable resource efficiency and comparable performance when adapting LLMs for specific tasks. Since ChatGPT demonstrated superior performance on various tasks, there has been a growing desire to adapt one model for all tasks. However, the explicit low-rank of LoRA limits the adaptation performance in complex multi-task scenarios. LoRA is dominated by a small number of top singular vectors while fine-tuning decomposes into a set of less important unitary transforms. In this paper, we propose MultiLoRA for better multi-task adaptation by reducing the dominance of top singular vectors observed in LoRA. MultiLoRA scales LoRA modules horizontally and change parameter initialization of adaptation matrices to reduce parameter dependency, thus yields more balanced unitary subspaces. We unprecedentedly construct specialized training data by mixing datasets of instruction follow, natural language understanding, world knowledge, to cover semantically and syntactically different samples. With only 2.5% of additional parameters, MultiLoRA outperforms single LoRA counterparts and fine-tuning on multiple benchmarks and model scales. Further investigation into weight update matrices of MultiLoRA exhibits reduced dependency on top singular vectors and more democratic unitary transform contributions",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing learning methods often struggle to balance interpretability and predictive performance. While models like nearest neighbors and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) offer high interpretability, their predictive performance on supervised learning tasks is often limited. In contrast, neural networks based on the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) support the modular construction of expressive architectures and tend to have better recognition accuracy but are often regarded as black boxes in terms of interpretability. Our approach aims to strike a better balance between these two aspects through the use of a building block based on NMF that incorporates supervised neural network training methods to achieve high predictive performance while retaining the desirable interpretability properties of NMF. We evaluate our Predictive Factorized Coupling (PFC) block on small datasets and show that it achieves competitive predictive performance with MLPs while also offering improved interpretability. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach in various scenarios, such as continual learning, training on non-i.i.d. data, and knowledge removal after training. Additionally, we show examples of using the PFC block to build more expressive architectures, including a fully-connected residual network as well as a factorized recurrent neural network (RNN) that performs competitively with vanilla RNNs while providing improved interpretability. The PFC block uses an iterative inference algorithm that converges to a fixed point, making it possible to trade off accuracy vs computation after training but also currently preventing its use as a general MLP replacement in some scenarios such as training on very large datasets.

    "abstract": "Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks, making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$ matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI",

Specifically, 1) to tackle the class imbalance issue, we introduce a dynamic class-wise selection mechanism, leveraging the clustering technique to identify clean nodes based on the neighbor-aggregated confidences. In this way, our approach can avoid the pitfalls of biased sampling which is common with global threshold techniques. 2) To alleviate the problem of noisy labels, built on the concept of the memorization effect, CSGNN prioritizes learning from clean nodes before noisy ones, thereby iteratively enhancing model performance while mitigating label noise.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "After a machine learning (ML)-based system is deployed in clinical practice, performance monitoring is important to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the algorithm over time. The goal of this work is to highlight the complexity of designing a monitoring strategy and the need for a systematic framework that compares the multitude of monitoring options. One of the main decisions is choosing between using real-world (observational) versus interventional data. Although the former is the most convenient source of monitoring data, it exhibits well-known biases, such as confounding, selection, and missingness. In fact, when the ML algorithm interacts with its environment, the algorithm itself may be a primary source of bias. On the other hand, a carefully designed interventional study that randomizes individuals can explicitly eliminate such biases, but the ethics, feasibility, and cost of such an approach must be carefully considered. Beyond the decision of the data source, monitoring strategies vary in the performance criteria they track, the interpretability of the test statistics, the strength of their assumptions, and their speed at detecting performance decay. As a first step towards developing a framework that compares the various monitoring options, we consider a case study of an ML-based risk prediction algorithm for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Bringing together tools from causal inference and statistical process control, we walk through the basic steps of defining candidate monitoring criteria, describing potential sources of bias and the causal model, and specifying and comparing candidate monitoring procedures. We hypothesize that these steps can be applied more generally, as causal inference can address other sources of biases as well",

Our methodology involves challenging these models with a small-scale geographic benchmark consisting of a suite of visual tasks, testing their abilities across a spectrum of complexity. The analysis uncovers not only where such models excel, including instances where they outperform humans, but also where they falter, providing a balanced view of their capabilities in the geographic domain.

    "title": "History Filtering in Imperfect Information Games: Algorithms and Complexity",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Historically applied exclusively to perfect information games, depth-limited search with value functions has been key to recent advances in AI for imperfect information games. Most prominent approaches with strong theoretical guarantees require subgame decomposition - a process in which a subgame is computed from public information and player beliefs. However, subgame decomposition can itself require non-trivial computations, and its tractability depends on the existence of efficient algorithms for either full enumeration or generation of the histories that form the root of the subgame. Despite this, no formal analysis of the tractability of such computations has been established in prior work, and application domains have often consisted of games, such as poker, for which enumeration is trivial on modern hardware. Applying these ideas to more complex domains requires understanding their cost. In this work, we introduce and analyze the computational aspects and tractability of filtering histories for subgame decomposition. We show that constructing a single history from the root of the subgame is generally intractable, and then provide a necessary and sufficient condition for efficient enumeration. We also introduce a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based generation algorithm for trick-taking card games - a domain where enumeration is often prohibitively expensive. Our experiments demonstrate its improved scalability in the trick-taking card game Oh Hell. These contributions clarify when and how depth-limited search via subgame decomposition can be an effective tool for sequential decision-making in imperfect information settings",

    "title": "Calibrated Language Models Must Hallucinate",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent language models have a mysterious tendency to generate false but plausible-sounding text. Such \"hallucinations\" are an obstacle to the usability of language-based AI systems and can harm people who rely upon their outputs. This work shows shows that there is an inherent statistical reason that pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having nothing to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For \"arbitrary\" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models. Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a \"Good-Turing\" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors. One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors (i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the type of arbitrary facts that tend to appear once in the training set. However, our analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the training data (like references to publications such as articles and books, whose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on systematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different architectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of hallucinations",

An example of this is Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR), which aids chemists in retrieving information about chemicals from large amounts of documents. Markush structures are chemical structures that cannot be parsed correctly by OCSR and cause errors. The focus of this research was to propose and test a novel method for classifying Markush structures. Within this method, a comparison was made between fixed-feature extraction and end-to-end learning (CNN). The end-to-end method performed significantly better than the fixed-feature method, achieving 0.928 (0.035 SD) Macro F1 compared to the fixed-feature method's 0.701 (0.052 SD). Because of the nature of the experiment, these figures are a lower bound and can be improved further. These results suggest that Markush structures can be filtered out effectively and accurately using the proposed method.

To this end, we conduct the first joint ARchitecture-Initialization-Aggregation study and benchmark ARIAs across a range of medical image classification tasks.

Evolving permutations directly requires specialized evolutionary operators. Over the years, many crossover and mutation operators have been developed for solving permutation problems with evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we survey the breadth of evolutionary operators for permutations. We implemented all of these in Chips-n-Salsa, an open source Java library for evolutionary computation.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The importance of systems that can extract structured information from textual data becomes increasingly pronounced given the ever-increasing volume of text produced on a daily basis. Having a system that can effectively extract such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can, to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Counting the number of answers to conjunctive queries is a fundamental problem in databases that, under standard assumptions, does not have an efficient solution. The issue is inherently #P-hard, extending even to classes of acyclic instances. To address this, we pinpoint tractable classes by examining the structural properties of instances and introducing the novel concept of #-hypertree decomposition. We establish the feasibility of counting answers in polynomial time for classes of queries featuring bounded #-hypertree width. Additionally, employing novel techniques from the realm of fixed-parameter computational complexity, we prove that, for bounded arity queries, the bounded #-hypertree width property precisely delineates the frontier of tractability for the counting problem. This result closes an important gap in our understanding of the complexity of such a basic problem for conjunctive queries and, equivalently, for constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Drawing upon #-hypertree decompositions, a ''hybrid'' decomposition method emerges. This approach leverages both the structural characteristics of the query and properties intrinsic to the input database, including keys or other (weaker) degree constraints that limit the permissible combinations of values. Intuitively, these features may introduce distinct structural properties that elude identification through the ''worst-possible database'' perspective inherent in purely structural methods",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI into radiology introduces opportunities for improved clinical care provision and efficiency but it demands a meticulous approach to mitigate potential risks as with any other new technology. Beginning with rigorous pre-deployment evaluation and validation, the focus should be on ensuring models meet the highest standards of safety, effectiveness and efficacy for their intended applications. Input and output guardrails implemented during production usage act as an additional layer of protection, identifying and addressing individual failures as they occur. Continuous post-deployment monitoring allows for tracking population-level performance (data drift), fairness, and value delivery over time. Scheduling reviews of post-deployment model performance and educating radiologists about new algorithmic-driven findings is critical for AI to be effective in clinical practice. Recognizing that no single AI solution can provide absolute assurance even when limited to its intended use, the synergistic application of quality assurance at multiple levels - regulatory, clinical, technical, and ethical - is emphasized. Collaborative efforts between stakeholders spanning healthcare systems, industry, academia, and government are imperative to address the multifaceted challenges involved. Trust in AI is an earned privilege, contingent on a broad set of goals, among them transparently demonstrating that the AI adheres to the same rigorous safety, effectiveness and efficacy standards as other established medical technologies. By doing so, developers can instil confidence among providers and patients alike, enabling the responsible scaling of AI and the realization of its potential benefits.

    "abstract": "The rise of renewables coincides with the shift towards Electrical Vehicles (EVs) posing technical and operational challenges for the energy balance of the local grid. Nowadays, the energy grid cannot deal with a spike in EVs usage leading to a need for more coordinated and grid aware EVs charging and discharging strategies. However, coordinating power flow from multiple EVs into the grid requires sophisticated algorithms and load-balancing strategies as the complexity increases with more control variables and EVs, necessitating large optimization and decision search spaces. In this paper, we propose an EVs fleet coordination model for the day ahead aiming to ensure a reliable energy supply and maintain a stable local grid, by utilizing EVs to store surplus energy and discharge it during periods of energy deficit. The optimization problem is addressed using Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) considering criteria related to energy grid balancing, time usage preference, and the location of EV drivers. The EVs schedules, associated with the position of individuals from the population, are adjusted through exploration and exploitation operations, and their technical and operational feasibility is ensured, while the rabbit individual is updated with a non-dominated EV schedule selected per iteration using a roulette wheel algorithm. The solution is evaluated within the framework of an e-mobility service in Terni city. The results indicate that coordinated charging and discharging of EVs not only meet balancing service requirements but also align with user preferences with minimal deviations",

Current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are predominantly constrained to grounding a single, pre-existing object, relying solely on data from Referring Expression Comprehension tasks. The limitation leads to a compromise in model design, necessitating the introduction of visual expert models or the integration of customized head structures. Beyond these constraints, our research delves into the untapped potential of LVLMs and uncover their inherent capability for basic object perception, allowing them to accurately identify and locate objects of interest. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel language-prompted localization dataset designed to fully unleash the capabilities of LVLMs in integrating fine-grained object perception with precise location awareness. More importantly, we present $\\textbf{Griffon}$, a purely LVLM-based baseline, which does not require the introduction of any special tokens, expert models, or additional detection modules. It simply maintains a consistent structure with popular LVLMs by unifying data formats across various localization-related scenarios and is trained end-to-end through a well-designed pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{Griffon}$ not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the fine-grained RefCOCO series but also approaches the capabilities of the expert model Faster RCNN on the detection benchmark MSCOCO",

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference signals that are in the form of ranking of response pairs to perform this alignment. However, human preference on LLM outputs can come in much richer forms including natural language, which may provide detailed feedback on strengths and weaknesses of a given response. In this work we investigate data efficiency of modeling human feedback that is in natural language. Specifically, we fine-tune an open-source LLM, e.g., Falcon-40B-Instruct, on a relatively small amount (1000 records or even less) of human feedback in natural language in the form of critiques and revisions of responses. We show that this model is able to improve the quality of responses from even some of the strongest LLMs such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Vicuna, through critique and revision of those responses. For instance, through one iteration of revision of ChatGPT responses, the revised responses have 56.6% win rate over the original ones, and this win rate can be further improved to 65.9% after applying the revision for five iterations",

Recently, the widespread adoption of large-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated rapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are mostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of high-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes CMed-GPT, which is the GPT pre-training language model based on Chinese medical domain text. The model is available in two versions, namely, base and large, with corresponding perplexity values of 8.64 and 8.01. Additionally, we incorporate lexical and entity embeddings into the dialogue text in a uniform manner to meet the requirements of downstream dialogue generation tasks. By applying both fine-tuning and p-tuning to CMed-GPT, we lowered the PPL from 8.44 to 7.35. This study not only confirms the exceptional performance of the CMed-GPT model in generating Chinese biomedical text but also highlights the advantages of p-tuning over traditional fine-tuning with prefix prompts. Furthermore, we validate the significance of incorporating external information in medical dialogue generation, which enhances the quality of dialogue generation",

    "abstract": "With the evolution of blockchain technology, the issue of transaction security, particularly on platforms like Ethereum, has become increasingly critical. Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose significant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these attack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities, then strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures their transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included in the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a comprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running attacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter each type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method named FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary Classification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions within decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate classification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement, insertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting front-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%",

While prior interactive models crop or resize PET volumes due to memory constraints, we use the complete volume with our sliding window-based interactive scheme. Our model outperforms existing non-sliding window interactive models on the AutoPET dataset and generalizes to the previously unseen HECKTOR dataset. A user study revealed that annotators achieve high-quality predictions with only 10 click iterations and a low perceived NASA-TLX workload.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing tools for explaining the output of image classifiers can be divided into white-box, which rely on access to the model internals, and black-box, agnostic to the model. As the usage of AI in the medical domain grows, so too does the usage of explainability tools. Existing work on medical image explanations focuses on white-box tools, such as gradcam. However, there are clear advantages to switching to a black-box tool, including the ability to use it with any classifier and the wide selection of black-box tools available. On standard images, black-box tools are as precise as white-box. In this paper we compare the performance of several black-box methods against gradcam on a brain cancer MRI dataset. We demonstrate that most black-box tools are not suitable for explaining medical image classifications and present a detailed analysis of the reasons for their shortcomings. We also show that one black-box tool, a causal explainability-based rex, performs as well as \\gradcam",

    "title": "How to ensure a safe control strategy? Towards a SRL for urban transit autonomous operation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has gradually shown its latent decision-making ability in urban rail transit autonomous operation. However, since reinforcement learning can not neither guarantee safety during learning nor execution, this is still one of the major obstacles to the practical application of reinforcement learning. Given this drawback, reinforcement learning applied in the safety-critical autonomous operation domain remains challenging without generating a safe control command sequence that avoids overspeed operations. Therefore, a SSA-DRL framework is proposed in this paper for safe intelligent control of urban rail transit autonomous operation trains. The proposed framework is combined with linear temporal logic, reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search and consists of four mainly module: a post-posed shielding, a searching tree module, a DRL framework and an additional actor. Furthermore, the output of the framework can meet speed constraint, schedule constraint and optimize the operation process. Finally, the proposed SSA-DRL framework for decision-making in urban rail transit autonomous operation is evaluated in sixteen different sections, and its effectiveness is demonstrated through an ablation experiment and comparison with the scheduled operation plan",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Automatic Strain Quantification in Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Quantification of cardiac motion with cine Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) is an integral part of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) diagnosis. Yet, the expert evaluation of motion abnormalities with CMRI is a challenging task. To automatically assess cardiac motion, we register CMRIs from different time points of the cardiac cycle using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and perform a biomechanically informed regularization inspired by the myocardial incompressibility assumption. To enhance the registration performance, our method first rectifies the inter-slice misalignment inherent to CMRI by performing a rigid registration guided by the long-axis views, and then increases the through-plane resolution using an unsupervised deep learning super-resolution approach. Finally, we propose to synergically combine information from short-axis and 4-chamber long-axis views, along with an initialization to incorporate information from multiple cardiac time points. Thereafter, to quantify cardiac motion, we calculate global and segmental strain over a cardiac cycle and compute the peak strain. The evaluation of the method is performed on a dataset of cine CMRI scans from 47 ARVC patients and 67 controls. Our results show that inter-slice alignment and generation of super-resolved volumes combined with joint analysis of the two cardiac views, notably improves registration performance. Furthermore, the proposed initialization yields more physiologically plausible registrations. The significant differences in the peak strain, discerned between the ARVC patients and healthy controls suggest that automated motion quantification methods may assist in diagnosis and provide further understanding of disease-specific alterations of cardiac motion",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For debugging and verification of computer vision convolutional deep neural networks (CNNs) human inspection of the learned latent representations is imperative. Therefore, state-of-the-art eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods globally associate given natural language semantic concepts with representing vectors or regions in the CNN latent space supporting manual inspection. Yet, this approach comes with two major disadvantages: They are locally inaccurate when reconstructing a concept label and discard information about the distribution of concept instance representations. The latter, though, is of particular interest for debugging, like finding and understanding outliers, learned notions of sub-concepts, and concept confusion. Furthermore, current single-layer approaches neglect that information about a concept may be spread over the CNN depth. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the local-to-global Guided Concept Projection Vectors (GCPV) approach: It (1) generates local concept vectors that each precisely reconstruct a concept segmentation label, and then (2) generalizes these to global concept and even sub-concept vectors by means of hiearchical clustering. Our experiments on object detectors demonstrate improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art, the benefit of multi-layer concept vectors, and robustness against low-quality concept segmentation labels. Finally, we demonstrate that GCPVs can be applied to find root causes for confusion of concepts like bus and truck, and reveal interesting concept-level outliers. Thus, GCPVs pose a promising step towards interpretable model debugging and informed data improvement",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Odor sensory evaluation has a broad application in food, clothing, cosmetics, and other fields. Traditional artificial sensory evaluation has poor repeatability, and the machine olfaction represented by the electronic nose (E-nose) is difficult to reflect human feelings. Olfactory electroencephalogram (EEG) contains odor and individual features associated with human olfactory preference, which has unique advantages in odor sensory evaluation. However, the difficulty of cross-subject olfactory EEG recognition greatly limits its application. It is worth noting that E-nose and olfactory EEG are more advantageous in representing odor information and individual emotions, respectively. In this paper, an E-nose and olfactory EEG multimodal learning method is proposed for cross-subject olfactory preference recognition. Firstly, the olfactory EEG and E-nose multimodal data acquisition and preprocessing paradigms are established. Secondly, a complementary multimodal data mining strategy is proposed to effectively mine the common features of multimodal data representing odor information and the individual features in olfactory EEG representing individual emotional information. Finally, the cross-subject olfactory preference recognition is achieved in 24 subjects by fusing the extracted common and individual features, and the recognition effect is superior to the state-of-the-art recognition methods. Furthermore, the advantages of the proposed method in cross-subject olfactory preference recognition indicate its potential for practical odor evaluation applications",

    "abstract": "In the age of technology, data is an increasingly important resource. This importance is growing in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), where sub fields such as Machine Learning (ML) need more and more data to achieve better results. Internet of Things (IoT) is the connection of sensors and smart objects to collect and exchange data, in addition to achieving many other tasks. A huge amount of the resource desired, data, is stored in mobile devices, sensors and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices, but remains there due to data protection restrictions. At the same time these devices do not have enough data or computational capacity to train good models. Moreover, transmitting, storing and processing all this data on a centralised server is problematic. Federated Learning (FL) provides an innovative solution that allows devices to learn in a collaborative way. More importantly, it accomplishes this without violating data protection laws. FL is currently growing, and there are several solutions that implement it. This article presents a prototype of a FL solution where the IoT devices used were raspberry pi boards. The results compare the performance of a solution of this type with those obtained in traditional approaches. In addition, the FL solution performance was tested in a hostile environment. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a image data set were used. The results show the feasibility and usability of these techniques, although in many cases they do not reach the performance of traditional approaches",

In this scoping review, we clarify the ways in which biases related to GAI in higher education settings have been discussed in recent academic publications and identify what type of potential biases are commonly reported in this body of literature. We searched for academic articles written in English, Chinese, and Japanese across four main databases concerned with GAI usage in higher education and bias. Our findings show that while there is an awareness of potential biases around large language models (LLMs) and GAI, the majority of articles touch on ``bias'' at a relatively superficial level. Few identify what types of bias may occur under what circumstances. Neither do they discuss the possible implications for the higher education, staff, faculty members, or students.

    "abstract": "Wind speed prediction is critical to the management of wind power generation. Due to the large range of wind speed fluctuations and wake effect, there may also be strong correlations between long-distance wind turbines. This difficult-to-extract feature has become a bottleneck for improving accuracy. History and future time information includes the trend of airflow changes, whether this dynamic information can be utilized will also affect the prediction effect. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes Windformer. First, Windformer divides the wind turbine cluster into multiple non-overlapping windows and calculates correlations inside the windows, then shifts the windows partially to provide connectivity between windows, and finally fuses multi-channel features based on detailed and global information. To dynamically model the change process of wind speed, this paper extracts time series in both history and future directions simultaneously. Compared with other current-advanced methods, the Mean Square Error (MSE) of Windformer is reduced by 0.5\\% to 15\\% on two datasets from NERL",

    "title": "Robust Domain Misinformation Detection via Multi-modal Feature Alignment",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher \"credibility\" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning suffers from catastrophic forgetting and sample inefficiency making it less applicable to the ever-changing real world. However, the ability to use previously learned knowledge is essential for AI agents to quickly adapt to novelties. Often, certain spatial information observed by the agent in the previous interactions can be leveraged to infer task-specific rules. Inferred rules can then help the agent to avoid potentially dangerous situations in the previously unseen states and guide the learning process increasing agent's novelty adaptation speed. In this work, we propose a general framework that is applicable to deep reinforcement learning agents. Our framework provides the agent with an autonomous way to discover the task-specific rules in the novel environments and self-supervise it's learning. We provide a rule-driven deep Q-learning agent (RDQ) as one possible implementation of that framework. We show that RDQ successfully extracts task-specific rules as it interacts with the world and uses them to drastically increase its learning efficiency. In our experiments, we show that the RDQ agent is significantly more resilient to the novelties than the baseline agents, and is able to detect and adapt to novel situations faster",

As a project moves through its life cycle, these identified risks and their assessments evolve. Some risks are realized to become issues, some are mitigated, and some are retired as no longer important. Despite the value provided by conventional expert-based approaches, several challenges remain due to the time-consuming and expensive processes involved. Moreover, limited is known about how risks evolve from ex-ante to ex-post over time. How well does the project team identify and evaluate risks in the initial phase compared to what happens during project execution? Using historical data and artificial intelligence techniques, this study addressed these limitations by introducing a data-driven framework to identify risks automatically and to examine the quality of early risk registers and risk assessments.

The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multimodal reasoning is a challenging task that requires models to reason across multiple modalities to answer questions. Existing approaches have made progress by incorporating language and visual modalities into a two-stage reasoning framework, separating rationale generation from answer inference. However, these approaches often fall short due to the inadequate quality of the generated rationales. In this work, we delve into the importance of rationales in model reasoning. We observe that when rationales are completely accurate, the model's accuracy significantly improves, highlighting the need for high-quality rationale generation. Motivated by this, we propose MC-CoT, a self-consistency training strategy that generates multiple rationales and answers, subsequently selecting the most accurate through a voting process. This approach not only enhances the quality of generated rationales but also leads to more accurate and robust answers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves model performance across various benchmarks. Remarkably, we show that even smaller base models, when equipped with our proposed approach, can achieve results comparable to those of larger models, illustrating the potential of our approach in harnessing the power of rationales for improved multimodal reasoning.

    "title": "AI-Generated Images Introduce Invisible Relevance Bias to Text-Image Retrieval",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of generation models, AI-generated content (AIGC) is becoming more realistic, flooding the Internet. A recent study suggests that this phenomenon has elevated the issue of source bias in text retrieval for web searches. Specifically, neural retrieval models tend to rank generated texts higher than human-written texts. In this paper, we extend the study of this bias to cross-modal retrieval. Firstly, we successfully construct a suitable benchmark to explore the existence of the bias. Subsequent extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that AI-generated images introduce an invisible relevance bias to text-image retrieval models. Specifically, our experiments show that text-image retrieval models tend to rank the AI-generated images higher than the real images, even though the AI-generated images do not exhibit more visually relevant features to the query than real images. This invisible relevance bias is prevalent across retrieval models with varying training data and architectures. Furthermore, our subsequent exploration reveals that the inclusion of AI-generated images in the training data of the retrieval models exacerbates the invisible relevance bias. The above phenomenon triggers a vicious cycle, which makes the invisible relevance bias become more and more serious. To elucidate the potential causes of invisible relevance and address the aforementioned issues, we introduce an effective training method aimed at alleviating the invisible relevance bias. Subsequently, we apply our proposed debiasing method to retroactively identify the causes of invisible relevance, revealing that the AI-generated images induce the image encoder to embed additional information into their representation. This information exhibits a certain consistency across generated images with different semantics and can make the retriever estimate a higher relevance score",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Linear structural causal models (SCMs) are used to express and analyse the relationships between random variables. Direct causal effects are represented as directed edges and confounding factors as bidirected edges. Identifying the causal parameters from correlations between the nodes is an open problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we study SCMs whose directed component forms a tree. Van der Zander et al. (AISTATS'22, PLMR 151, pp. 6770--6792, 2022) give a PSPACE-algorithm for the identification problem in this case, which is a significant improvement over the general Gr\\\"obner basis approach, which has doubly-exponential time complexity in the number of structural parameters. In this work, we present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm, which solves the identification problem for tree-shaped SCMs. For every structural parameter, our algorithms decides whether it is generically identifiable, generically 2-identifiable, or generically unidentifiable. (No other cases can occur.) In the first two cases, it provides one or two fractional affine square root terms of polynomials (FASTPs) for the corresponding parameter, respectively",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the race towards quantum computing, the potential benefits of quantum neural networks (QNNs) have become increasingly apparent. However, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) processors are prone to errors, which poses a significant challenge for the execution of complex algorithms or quantum machine learning. To ensure the quality and security of QNNs, it is crucial to explore the impact of noise on their performance. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of noise on QNNs, examining the Mottonen state preparation algorithm under various noise models and studying the degradation of quantum states as they pass through multiple layers of QNNs. Additionally, the paper evaluates the effect of noise on the performance of pre-trained QNNs and highlights the challenges posed by noise models in quantum computing. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of quantum software, emphasizing the importance of prioritizing stability and noise-correction measures when developing QNNs to ensure reliable and trustworthy results. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum computing and quantum machine learning, providing new insights into the impact of noise on QNNs and paving the way towards the development of more robust and efficient quantum algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "End users face a choice between privacy and efficiency in current Large Language Model (LLM) service paradigms. In cloud-based paradigms, users are forced to compromise data locality for generation quality and processing speed. Conversely, edge device paradigms maintain data locality but fail to deliver satisfactory performance. In this work, we propose a novel LLM service paradigm that distributes privacy-sensitive computation on edge devices and shared computation in the cloud. Only activations are transmitted between the central cloud and edge devices to ensure data locality. Our core innovation, PrivateLoRA, addresses the challenging communication overhead by exploiting the low rank of residual activations, achieving over 95% communication reduction. Consequently, PrivateLoRA effectively maintains data locality and is extremely resource efficient. Under standard 5G networks, PrivateLoRA achieves throughput over 300% of device-only solutions for 7B models and over 80% of an A100 GPU for 33B models. PrivateLoRA also provides tuning performance comparable to LoRA for advanced personalization. Our approach democratizes access to state-of-the-art generative AI for edge devices, paving the way for more tailored LLM experiences for the general public. To our knowledge, our proposed framework is the first efficient and privacy-preserving LLM solution in the literature",

    "title": "When Side-Channel Attacks Break the Black-Box Property of Embedded Artificial Intelligence",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, and specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the standard for several tasks from specific advertising to object detection. The performance offered has led DNN algorithms to become a part of critical embedded systems, requiring both efficiency and reliability. In particular, DNNs are subject to malicious examples designed in a way to fool the network while being undetectable to the human observer: the adversarial examples. While previous studies propose frameworks to implement such attacks in black box settings, those often rely on the hypothesis that the attacker has access to the logits of the neural network, breaking the assumption of the traditional black box. In this paper, we investigate a real black box scenario where the attacker has no access to the logits. In particular, we propose an architecture-agnostic attack which solve this constraint by extracting the logits. Our method combines hardware and software attacks, by performing a side-channel attack that exploits electromagnetic leakages to extract the logits for a given input, allowing an attacker to estimate the gradients and produce state-of-the-art adversarial examples to fool the targeted neural network. Through this example of adversarial attack, we demonstrate the effectiveness of logits extraction using side-channel as a first step for more general attack frameworks requiring either the logits or the confidence scores",

In practical applications, users aspire for solutions that converge to the region of interest (ROI) along the Pareto front (PF). While the conventional approach involves approximating a fitness function or an objective function to reflect user preferences, this paper explores an alternative avenue. Specifically, we aim to discover a method that sidesteps the need for calculating the fitness function, relying solely on human feedback. Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning facilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is structured into three sessions. Firstly, we assess the performance of our active dueling bandit algorithm. Secondly, we implement our proposed method within the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Finally, we deploy our method in a practical problem, specifically in protein structure prediction (PSP). This research presents a novel interactive preference-based MOEA framework that not only addresses the limitations of traditional techniques but also unveils new possibilities for optimization problems",

    "title": "Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning for Answering Knowledge-intensive Complex Questions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of answering knowledge-intensive complex questions with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they tend to generate factually incorrect reasoning steps when the required knowledge is not available or up-to-date in models' parameters. Recent works turn to retrieving external knowledge to augment CoT reasoning. Despite being promising, these chain-based methods suffer from: 1) Negative retrieval. Unnecessary or incorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the ability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate along the chain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query tree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node. Then, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions from leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and answering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident answer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA that employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative retrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs have broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from child nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three Complex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning",

    "title": "Parameter Exchange for Robust Dynamic Domain Generalization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Agnostic domain shift is the main reason of model degradation on the unknown target domains, which brings an urgent need to develop Domain Generalization (DG). Recent advances at DG use dynamic networks to achieve training-free adaptation on the unknown target domains, termed Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), which compensates for the lack of self-adaptability in static models with fixed weights. The parameters of dynamic networks can be decoupled into a static and a dynamic component, which are designed to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features, respectively. Based on the existing arts, in this work, we try to push the limits of DDG by disentangling the static and dynamic components more thoroughly from an optimization perspective. Our main consideration is that we can enable the static component to learn domain-invariant features more comprehensively by augmenting the domain-specific information. As a result, the more comprehensive domain-invariant features learned by the static component can then enforce the dynamic component to focus more on learning adaptive domain-specific features. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Parameter Exchange (PE) method to perturb the combination between the static and dynamic components. We optimize the model using the gradients from both the perturbed and non-perturbed feed-forward jointly to implicitly achieve the aforementioned disentanglement. In this way, the two components can be optimized in a mutually-beneficial manner, which can resist the agnostic domain shifts and improve the self-adaptability on the unknown target domain. Extensive experiments show that PE can be easily plugged into existing dynamic networks to improve their generalization ability without bells and whistles",

Using a traffic light to segregate car and bike flows, with the addition of bike-specific green phases, is a lightweight and cheap solution that can be deployed dynamically to assess the opportunity of a heavier infrastructure such as a separate bike lane. To compensate for the increased waiting time induced by these new phases, we introduce in this paper a deep reinforcement learning solution that adapts the green phase cycle of a traffic light to the traffic. Vehicle counter data are used to compare the DRL approach with the actuated traffic light control algorithm over whole days. Results show that DRL achieves better minimization of vehicle waiting time at almost all hours. Our DRL approach is also robust to moderate changes in bike traffic.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Specifying legal requirements for software systems to ensure their compliance with the applicable regulations is a major concern to requirements engineering (RE). Personal data which is collected by an organization is often shared with other organizations to perform certain processing activities. In such cases, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires issuing a data processing agreement (DPA) which regulates the processing and further ensures that personal data remains protected. Violating GDPR can lead to huge fines reaching to billions of Euros. Software systems involving personal data processing must adhere to the legal obligations stipulated in GDPR and outlined in DPAs. Requirements engineers can elicit from DPAs legal requirements for regulating the data processing activities in software systems. Checking the completeness of a DPA according to the GDPR provisions is therefore an essential prerequisite to ensure that the elicited requirements are complete. Analyzing DPAs entirely manually is time consuming and requires adequate legal expertise. In this paper, we propose an automation strategy to address the completeness checking of DPAs against GDPR. Specifically, we pursue ten alternative solutions which are enabled by different technologies, namely traditional machine learning, deep learning, language modeling, and few-shot learning. The goal of our work is to empirically examine how these different technologies fare in the legal domain. We computed F2 score on a set of 30 real DPAs. Our evaluation shows that best-performing solutions yield F2 score of 86.7% and 89.7% are based on pre-trained BERT and RoBERTa language models. Our analysis further shows that other alternative solutions based on deep learning (e.g., BiLSTM) and few-shot learning (e.g., SetFit) can achieve comparable accuracy, yet are more efficient to develop",

A wealth of relevant, untapped Mental Health (MH) data is available in online communities, providing the opportunity to address the explainability problem with substantial potential impact as a screening tool for both online and offline applications. We develop a method to enhance attention in popular transformer models and generate clinician-understandable explanations for classification by incorporating external clinical knowledge. Inspired by how clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage relevant clinical knowledge to model patient inputs, providing meaningful explanations for classification. This will save manual review time and engender trust. We develop such a system in the context of MH using clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for diagnosing depression, a mental health disorder of global concern. We propose an application-specific language model called ProcesS knowledge-infused cross ATtention (PSAT), which incorporates CPGs when computing attention. Through rigorous evaluation on three expert-curated datasets related to depression, we demonstrate application-relevant explainability of PSAT. PSAT also surpasses the performance of nine baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. We transform a CPG resource focused on depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (e.g. PHQ-9) and related questions, into a machine-readable ontology using SNOMED-CT.

However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental data. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity.

Specifically, it is proposed to look at fragmented student models divided from the full student model as low models. As the grade level rises, fragmented student models deepen in conjunction with designed teaching reference layers, while learning and distilling from more teacher models. By moving from lower to higher grades, fragmented student models were gradually integrated into a complete target student model, and the performance of the student models gradually improved from lower to senior grades of the stage. Education distillation strategies combined with distillation algorithms outperform the results of single distillation algorithms on the public dataset CIFAR100,Caltech256, Food-101 dataset",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Perceiving vehicles in a driver's blind spot is vital for safe driving. The detection of potentially dangerous vehicles in these blind spots can benefit from vehicular network semantic communication technology. However, efficient semantic communication involves a trade-off between accuracy and delay, especially in bandwidth-limited situations. This paper unveils a scalable Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) system that leverages an encoder-decoder architecture. This system converts images into textual representations and reconstructs them into quality-acceptable images, optimizing transmission for vehicular network semantic communication. Moreover, when bandwidth allows, auxiliary information is integrated. The encoder-decoder aims to maintain semantic equivalence with the original images across various tasks. Then the proposed approach employs reinforcement learning to enhance the reliability of the generated contents. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method surpasses the baseline in perceiving vehicles in blind spots and effectively compresses communication data. While this method is specifically designed for driving scenarios, this encoder-decoder architecture also holds potential for wide use across various semantic communication scenarios",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The increasing use of medical imaging in healthcare settings presents a significant challenge due to the increasing workload for radiologists, yet it also offers opportunity for enhancing healthcare outcomes if effectively leveraged. 3D image retrieval holds potential to reduce radiologist workloads by enabling clinicians to efficiently search through diagnostically similar or otherwise relevant cases, resulting in faster and more precise diagnoses. However, the field of 3D medical image retrieval is still emerging, lacking established evaluation benchmarks, comprehensive datasets, and thorough studies. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by introducing a novel benchmark for 3D Medical Image Retrieval (3D-MIR) that encompasses four different anatomies imaged with computed tomography. Using this benchmark, we explore a diverse set of search strategies that use aggregated 2D slices, 3D volumes, and multi-modal embeddings from popular multi-modal foundation models as queries. Quantitative and qualitative assessments of each approach are provided alongside an in-depth discussion that offers insight for future research. To promote the advancement of this field, our benchmark, dataset, and code are made publicly available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "These days, deep learning models have achieved great success in multiple fields, from autonomous driving to medical diagnosis. These models have expanded the abilities of artificial intelligence by offering great solutions to complex problems that were very difficult to solve earlier. In spite of their unseen success in various, it has been identified, through research conducted, that deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks that compromise model security and data privacy of the Deep Neural Network models. Deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks at different stages of their lifecycle. During the testing phase, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities through different kinds of attacks such as Model Extraction Attacks, Model Inversion attacks, and Adversarial attacks. Model Extraction Attacks are aimed at reverse-engineering a trained deep learning model, with the primary objective of revealing its architecture and parameters. Model inversion attacks aim to compromise the privacy of the data used in the Deep learning model. These attacks are done to compromise the confidentiality of the model by going through the sensitive training data from the model's predictions. By analyzing the model's responses, attackers aim to reconstruct sensitive information. In this way, the model's data privacy is compromised. Adversarial attacks, mainly employed on computer vision models, are made to corrupt models into confidently making incorrect predictions through malicious testing data. These attacks subtly alter the input data, making it look normal but misleading deep learning models to make incorrect decisions. Such attacks can happen during both the model's evaluation and training phases. Data Poisoning Attacks add harmful data to the training set, disrupting the learning process and reducing the reliability of the deep learning mode",

However, recent research has demonstrated that FL protocols can be easily compromised by active reconstruction attacks executed by dishonest servers. These attacks involve the malicious modification of global model parameters, allowing the server to obtain a verbatim copy of users' private data by inverting their gradient updates. Tackling this class of attack remains a crucial challenge due to the strong threat model. In this paper, we propose OASIS, a defense mechanism based on image augmentation that effectively counteracts active reconstruction attacks while preserving model performance. We first uncover the core principle of gradient inversion that enables these attacks and theoretically identify the main conditions by which the defense can be robust regardless of the attack strategies. We then construct OASIS with image augmentation showing that it can undermine the attack principle. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of OASIS highlighting its feasibility as a solution",

    "abstract": "The quantification of biomarkers on immunohistochemistry breast cancer images is essential for defining appropriate therapy for breast cancer patients, as well as for extracting relevant information on disease prognosis. This is an arduous and time-consuming task that may introduce a bias in the results due to intra- and inter-observer variability which could be alleviated by making use of automatic quantification tools. However, this is not a simple processing task given the heterogeneity of breast tumors that results in non-uniformly distributed tumor cells exhibiting different staining colors and intensity, size, shape, and texture, of the nucleus, cytoplasm and membrane. In this research work, we demonstrate the feasibility of using a deep learning-based instance segmentation architecture for the automatic quantification of both nuclear and membrane biomarkers applied to IHC-stained slides. We have solved the cumbersome task of training set generation with the design and implementation of a web platform, which has served as a hub for communication and feedback between researchers and pathologists as well as a system for the validation of the automatic image processing models. Through this tool, we have collected annotations over samples of HE, ER and Ki-67 (nuclear biomarkers) and HER2 (membrane biomarker) IHC-stained images. Using the same deep learning network architecture, we have trained two models, so-called nuclei- and membrane-aware segmentation models, which, once successfully validated, have revealed to be a promising method to segment nuclei instances in IHC-stained images. The quantification method proposed in this work has been integrated into the developed web platform and is currently being used as a decision-support tool by pathologists",

We introduce the CommonSense Object Affordance Task (COAT), a novel framework designed to analyze reasoning capabilities in commonsense scenarios. This approach is centered on understanding how these agents can effectively identify and utilize alternative objects when executing household tasks, thereby offering insights into the complexities of practical decision-making in real-world environments.Drawing inspiration from human decision-making, we explore how large language models tackle this challenge through three meticulously crafted commonsense question-and-answer datasets, featuring refined rules and human annotations. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art language models on these datasets sheds light on three pivotal considerations: 1) aligning an object's inherent utility with the task at hand, 2) navigating contextual dependencies (societal norms, safety, appropriateness, and efficiency), and 3) accounting for the current physical state of the object. To maintain accessibility, we introduce five abstract variables reflecting an object's physical condition, modulated by human insights to simulate diverse household scenarios. Our contributions include insightful Object-Utility mappings addressing the first consideration and two extensive QA datasets (15k and 130k questions) probing the intricacies of contextual dependencies and object states. The datasets, along with our findings, are accessible at: \\url{https://github.com/com-phy-affordance/COAT}.

We aim to assess the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in the task of zero-shot long document evidence retrieval, owing to their unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks. However, currently the LLMs can consume limited context lengths as input, thus providing document chunks as inputs might overlook the global context while missing out on capturing the inter-segment dependencies. Moreover, directly feeding the large input sets can incur significant computational costs, particularly when processing the entire document (and potentially incurring monetary expenses with enterprise APIs like OpenAI's GPT variants). To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques that exploit the discourse structure commonly found in documents. By utilizing this structure, we create a condensed representation of the document, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of relationships between different parts. We retain $99.6\\%$ of the best zero-shot approach's performance, while processing only $26\\%$ of the total tokens used by the best approach in the information seeking evidence retrieval setup.

However, most current methods require reference to stylized images and cannot individually stylize specific objects. To overcome this limitation, we propose the \"Soulstyler\" framework, which allows users to guide the stylization of specific objects in an image through simple textual descriptions. We introduce a large language model to parse the text and identify stylization goals and specific styles. Combined with a CLIP-based semantic visual embedding encoder, the model understands and matches text and image content. We also introduce a novel localized text-image block matching loss that ensures that style transfer is performed only on specified target objects, while non-target regions remain in their original style. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to accurately perform style transfer on target objects according to textual descriptions without affecting the style of background regions.

Intuitively, different video understanding tasks may require representations that are complementary and at different granularities. To this end, we propose versatile action models (Vamos), a learning framework powered by a large language model as the \"reasoner\", and can flexibly leverage visual embeddings, action labels, and free-form descriptions extracted from videos as its input. We evaluate Vamos on four complementary video understanding benchmarks, Ego4D, Next-QA, IntentQA, and EgoSchema, on its capability to model temporal dynamics, encode visual history, and perform reasoning. Surprisingly, we observe that text-based representations consistently achieve competitive performance on all benchmarks, and that visual embeddings provide marginal or no performance improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of text-based video representation in the LLM era.

    "title": "Enigma: Privacy-Preserving Execution of QAOA on Untrusted Quantum Computers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Quantum computers can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of conventional computers. As quantum computers are expensive and hard to maintain, the typical model for performing quantum computation is to send the circuit to a quantum cloud provider. This leads to privacy concerns for commercial entities as an untrusted server can learn protected information from the provided circuit. Current proposals for Secure Quantum Computing (SQC) either rely on emerging technologies (such as quantum networks) or incur prohibitive overheads (for Quantum Homomorphic Encryption). The goal of our paper is to enable low-cost privacy-preserving quantum computation that can be used with current systems. We propose Enigma, a suite of privacy-preserving schemes specifically designed for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Unlike previous SQC techniques that obfuscate quantum circuits, Enigma transforms the input problem of QAOA, such that the resulting circuit and the outcomes are unintelligible to the server. We introduce three variants of Enigma. Enigma-I protects the coefficients of QAOA using random phase flipping and fudging of values. Enigma-II protects the nodes of the graph by introducing decoy qubits, which are indistinguishable from primary ones. Enigma-III protects the edge information of the graph by modifying the graph such that each node has an identical number of connections. For all variants of Enigma, we demonstrate that we can still obtain the solution for the original problem. We evaluate Enigma using IBM quantum devices and show that the privacy improvements of Enigma come at only a small reduction in fidelity (1%-13%)",

    "abstract": "A physics-driven generative adversarial network (GAN) was established here for single-pixel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in the infrared spectrum, to eliminate the extensive data training work required by traditional data-driven model. Within the GAN framework, the physical process of single-pixel imaging (SPI) was integrated into the generator, and the actual and estimated one-dimensional (1D) bucket signals were employed as constraints in the objective function to update the network's parameters and optimize the generator with the assistance of the discriminator. In comparison to single-pixel infrared HSI methods based on compressed sensing and physics-driven convolution neural networks, our physics-driven GAN-based single-pixel infrared HSI can achieve higher imaging performance but with fewer measurements. We believe that this physics-driven GAN will promote practical applications of computational imaging, especially various SPI-based techniques",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The pre-trained language models are continually fine-tuned to better support downstream applications. However, this operation may result in significant performance degeneration on general tasks beyond the targeted domain. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method which enables the fine-tuned model to stay resilient in general perspectives. Our method is conducted in the form of model merging (namely LM-Cocktail), where the fine-tuned language model is merged with the pre-trained base model or the peer models from other domains through weighted average. Despite simplicity, LM-Cocktail is surprisingly effective: the resulted model is able to achieve a strong empirical performance in the whole scope of general tasks while preserving a superior capacity in its targeted domain. We conduct comprehensive experiments with LLama and BGE model on popular benchmarks, including FLAN, MMLU, MTEB, whose results validate the efficacy of our proposed method.

It refines training progressively, tailors training to task requirements, and improves generalization through exposure to diverse examples. We present a curriculum learning approach that builds on existing knowledge about text and graph complexity formalisms for training with text graph data. The core part of our approach is a novel data scheduler, which employs \"spaced repetition\" and complexity formalisms to guide the training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several text graph tasks and graph neural network architectures. The proposed model gains more and uses less data; consistently prefers text over graph complexity indices throughout training, while the best curricula derived from text and graph complexity indices are equally effective; and it learns transferable curricula across GNN models and datasets. In addition, we find that both node-level (local) and graph-level (global) graph complexity indices, as well as shallow and traditional text complexity indices play a crucial role in effective curriculum learning",

The research is centred on employing GPT-3.5-turbo to automate the analysis of these arguments, with a focus on understanding intricate reasoning processes, generating clear and coherent explanations, and creating novel arguments. The methodology encompasses a series of tasks including detailed reasoning, interpretation, and the augmentation of a fortiori arguments. It involves meticulously identifying these arguments in diverse contexts, differentiating comparative elements, and categorizing them based on their logical structure. Extensive experiments reveals the challenges encountered by GPT-3.5-turbo in accurately detecting and classifying a fortiori arguments. Nevertheless, the model demonstrates a performance that rivals specialized models, particularly in extracting key components and interpreting underlying properties. The integration of external information into the model's processing significantly elevates the quality of the generated explanations. Additionally, the model exhibits a noteworthy capability in augmenting arguments, thus contributing to the enrichment of the data set. Despite facing certain limitations, this thesis makes significant contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence and logical reasoning. It introduces novel methodologies, establishes a rigorous evaluation framework, and provides deep insights that set the stage for future advancements in automated logical reasoning.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Extending image-based Large Multimodal Models (LMM) to videos is challenging due to the inherent complexity of video data. The recent approaches extending image-based LMM to videos either lack the grounding capabilities (e.g., VideoChat, Video-ChatGPT, Video-LLaMA) or do not utilize the audio-signals for better video understanding (e.g., Video-ChatGPT). Addressing these gaps, we propose Video-LLaVA, the first LMM with pixel-level grounding capability, integrating audio cues by transcribing them into text to enrich video-context understanding. Our framework uses an off-the-shelf tracker and a novel grounding module, enabling it to spatially and temporally localize objects in videos following user instructions. We evaluate Video-LLaVA using video-based generative and question-answering benchmarks and introduce new benchmarks specifically designed to measure prompt-based object grounding performance in videos. Further, we propose the use of Vicuna over GPT-3.5, as utilized in Video-ChatGPT, for video-based conversation benchmarking, ensuring reproducibility of results which is a concern with the proprietary nature of GPT-3.5. Our framework builds on SoTA image-based LLaVA model and extends its advantages to the video domain, delivering promising gains on video-based conversation and grounding tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The field of Explainable AI (XAI) is seeking to shed light on the inner workings of complex AI models and uncover the rationale behind their decisions. One of the models gaining attention are probabilistic circuits (PCs), which are a general and unified framework for tractable probabilistic models that support efficient computation of various probabilistic queries. Probabilistic circuits guarantee inference that is polynomial in the size of the circuit. In this paper, we improve the explainability of probabilistic circuits by computing a comprehensible, readable logical theory that covers the high-density regions generated by a PC. To achieve this, pruning approaches based on generative significance are used in a new method called PUTPUT (Probabilistic circuit Understanding Through Pruning Underlying logical Theories). The method is applied to a real world use case where music playlists are automatically generated and expressed as readable (database) queries. Evaluation shows that this approach can effectively produce a comprehensible logical theory that describes the high-density regions of a PC and outperforms state of the art methods when exploring the performance-comprehensibility trade-off",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be utilized for solving complex sequential decision-making tasks by providing high-level instructions. However, LLM-based agents face limitations in real-time dynamic environments due to their lack of specialization in solving specific target problems. Moreover, the deployment of such LLM-based agents is both costly and time-consuming in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that addresses these challenges by training a smaller scale specialized student agent using instructions from an LLM-based teacher agent. By leveraging guided actions provided by the teachers, the prior knowledge of the LLM is distilled into the local student model. Consequently, the student agent can be trained with significantly less data. Furthermore, subsequent training with environment feedback empowers the student agents to surpass the capabilities of their teachers. We conducted experiments on three challenging MiniGrid environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework. The results demonstrate that our approach enhances sample efficiency and achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in the Close World problem, being able to accurately recognize old knowledge through training and classification. However, AI faces significant challenges in the Open World problem, as it involves a new and unknown exploration journey. AI is not inherently proactive in exploration, and its challenge lies in not knowing how to approach and adapt to the unknown world. How do humans acquire knowledge of the unknown world. Humans identify new knowledge through intrinsic cognition. In the process of recognizing new colors, the cognitive cues are different from known color features and involve hue, saturation, brightness, and other characteristics. When AI encounters objects with different features in the new world, it faces another challenge: where are the distinguishing features between influential features of new and old objects? AI often mistakes a new world's brown bear for a known dog because it has not learned the differences in feature distributions between knowledge systems. This is because things in the new and old worlds have different units and dimensions for their features. This paper proposes an open-world model and elemental feature system that focuses on fundamentally recognizing the distribution differences in objective features between the new and old worlds. The quantum tunneling effect of learning ability in the new and old worlds is realized through the tractive force of meta-characteristic. The outstanding performance of the model system in learning new knowledge (using pedestrian re-identification datasets as an example) demonstrates that AI has acquired the ability to recognize the new world with an accuracy of $96.71\\%$ at most and has gained the capability to explore new knowledge, similar to humans",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Video semantic segmentation is a pivotal aspect of video representation learning. However, significant domain shifts present a challenge in effectively learning invariant spatio-temporal features across the labeled source domain and unlabeled target domain for video semantic segmentation. To solve the challenge, we propose a novel DA-STC method for domain adaptive video semantic segmentation, which incorporates a bidirectional multi-level spatio-temporal fusion module and a category-aware spatio-temporal feature alignment module to facilitate consistent learning for domain-invariant features. Firstly, we perform bidirectional spatio-temporal fusion at the image sequence level and shallow feature level, leading to the construction of two fused intermediate video domains. This prompts the video semantic segmentation model to consistently learn spatio-temporal features of shared patch sequences which are influenced by domain-specific contexts, thereby mitigating the feature gap between the source and target domain. Secondly, we propose a category-aware feature alignment module to promote the consistency of spatio-temporal features, facilitating adaptation to the target domain. Specifically, we adaptively aggregate the domain-specific deep features of each category along spatio-temporal dimensions, which are further constrained to achieve cross-domain intra-class feature alignment and inter-class feature separation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art mIOUs on multiple challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, we extend the proposed DA-STC to the image domain, where it also exhibits superior performance for domain adaptive semantic segmentation.

Accurate 3D tooth segmentation in IOSs is critical for various dental applications, while previous methods are error-prone at complicated boundaries and exhibit unsatisfactory results across patients. In this paper, we propose TSegFormer which captures both local and global dependencies among different teeth and the gingiva in the IOS point clouds with a multi-task 3D transformer architecture. Moreover, we design a geometry-guided loss based on a novel point curvature to refine boundaries in an end-to-end manner, avoiding time-consuming post-processing to reach clinically applicable segmentation. In addition, we create a dataset with 16,000 IOSs, the largest ever IOS dataset to the best of our knowledge. The experimental results demonstrate that our TSegFormer consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art baselines.

We demonstrate it with an example of a humanoid robot looking at the mirror and learning to detect the 3D pose of its own body from the image it perceives. To build our model, we first obtain features from the visual input and the postures of the robot's body via models prepared before the robot's operation. Then, we map their corresponding latent spaces by a sample-efficient robot's self-exploration at the mirror. In this way, the robot builds the solicited 3D pose detector, which quality is immediately perfect on the acquired samples instead of obtaining the quality gradually. The mapping, which employs associating the pairs of feature vectors, is then implemented in the same way as the key-value mechanism of the famous transformer models. Finally, deploying our model for imitation to a simulated robot allows us to study, tune up, and systematically evaluate its hyperparameters without the involvement of the human counterpart, advancing our previous research",

In this context, Entrepreneurial Finance is a particularly fertile ground for future Artificial Intelligence proliferation. To support the latter, the study provides a bibliometric review of Artificial Intelligence applications in (1) entrepreneurial finance literature, and (2) corporate finance literature with implications for Entrepreneurship. Rigorous search and screening procedures of the scientific database Web of Science Core Collection resulted in the identification of 1890 relevant journal articles subjected to analysis. The bibliometric analysis gives a rich insight into the knowledge field's conceptual, intellectual, and social structure, indicating nascent and underdeveloped research directions. As far as we were able to identify, this is the first study to map and bibliometrically analyze the academic field concerning the relationship between Artificial Intelligence, Entrepreneurship, and Finance, and the first review that deals with Artificial Intelligence methods in Entrepreneurship.

At the same time, applying Topic Modeling, Fuzzy Neural Network and Growing Hierarchical Self-organizing Map is quite rare.

Our approach is different because it used adaptive average ensemble after training which has increased the performance of evaluation metrics. It averages the outputs of every trained model, and every model will have weight according to its accuracy. The accuracy in the adaptive weighted ensemble model has achieved 98% where the accuracy has increased by 1 percent which is better than the best participating model in the ensemble which was 97%. Also, it decreased the numbers of false positive and false negative and enhanced the performance metrics",

    "abstract": "The exploration of multimodal language models integrates multiple data types, such as images, text, language, audio, and other heterogeneity. While the latest large language models excel in text-based tasks, they often struggle to understand and process other data types. Multimodal models address this limitation by combining various modalities, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of diverse data. This paper begins by defining the concept of multimodal and examining the historical development of multimodal algorithms. Furthermore, we introduce a range of multimodal products, focusing on the efforts of major technology companies. A practical guide is provided, offering insights into the technical aspects of multimodal models. Moreover, we present a compilation of the latest algorithms and commonly used datasets, providing researchers with valuable resources for experimentation and evaluation. Lastly, we explore the applications of multimodal models and discuss the challenges associated with their development. By addressing these aspects, this paper aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of multimodal models and their potential in various domains",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large language models (LLMs) have become a hot research topic. Education plays an important role in human social development and progress. Traditional education faces challenges such as individual student differences, insufficient allocation of teaching resources, and assessment of teaching effectiveness. Therefore, the applications of LLMs in the field of digital/smart education have broad prospects. The research on educational large models (EduLLMs) is constantly evolving, providing new methods and approaches to achieve personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and educational assessment goals, thereby improving the quality of education and the learning experience. This article aims to investigate and summarize the application of LLMs in smart education. It first introduces the research background and motivation of LLMs and explains the essence of LLMs. It then discusses the relationship between digital education and EduLLMs and summarizes the current research status of educational large models. The main contributions are the systematic summary and vision of the research background, motivation, and application of large models for education (LLM4Edu). By reviewing existing research, this article provides guidance and insights for educators, researchers, and policy-makers to gain a deep understanding of the potential and challenges of LLM4Edu. It further provides guidance for further advancing the development and application of LLM4Edu, while still facing technical, ethical, and practical challenges requiring further research and exploration",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object co-occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA.The source code will be released at \\url{https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor}",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely recognized as transformative technology due to their capabilities to understand and generate natural language text, including plans with some limited reasoning capabilities. LLM-based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of LLMs, which enable them to autonomously break down the given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate the task execution to fulfill the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building LLM-based autonomous agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using autonomous agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as architecture design guidelines and enables responsible-AI-by-design when designing LLM-based autonomous agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposed reference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-world agents",

    "title": "Toward Robust Imperceptible Perturbation against Unauthorized Text-to-image Diffusion-based Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language serves as a vehicle for conveying thought, enabling communication among individuals. The ability to distinguish between diverse concepts, identify fairness and injustice, and comprehend a range of legal notions fundamentally relies on logical reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) attempt to emulate human language understanding and generation, but their competency in logical reasoning remains limited. This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities. Through RLLF and a revised evaluation methodology, we explore new avenues for research in this domain and contribute to the development of LLMs capable of handling complex legal reasoning tasks while acknowledging the fundamental connection between language and logic",

    "abstract": "Synthetic samples from diffusion models are promising for leveraging in training discriminative models as replications of real training datasets. However, we found that the synthetic datasets degrade classification performance over real datasets even when using state-of-the-art diffusion models. This means that modern diffusion models do not perfectly represent the data distribution for the purpose of replicating datasets for training discriminative tasks. This paper investigates the gap between synthetic and real samples by analyzing the synthetic samples reconstructed from real samples through the diffusion and reverse process. By varying the time steps starting the reverse process in the reconstruction, we can control the trade-off between the information in the original real data and the information added by diffusion models. Through assessing the reconstructed samples and trained models, we found that the synthetic data are concentrated in modes of the training data distribution as the reverse step increases, and thus, they are difficult to cover the outer edges of the distribution. Our findings imply that modern diffusion models are insufficient to replicate training data distribution perfectly, and there is room for the improvement of generative modeling in the replication of training datasets",

    "abstract": "Passively collected behavioral health data from ubiquitous sensors holds significant promise to provide mental health professionals insights from patient's daily lives; however, developing analysis tools to use this data in clinical practice requires addressing challenges of generalization across devices and weak or ambiguous correlations between the measured signals and an individual's mental health. To address these challenges, we take a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to synthesize clinically useful insights from multi-sensor data. We develop chain of thought prompting methods that use LLMs to generate reasoning about how trends in data such as step count and sleep relate to conditions like depression and anxiety. We first demonstrate binary depression classification with LLMs achieving accuracies of 61.1% which exceed the state of the art. While it is not robust for clinical use, this leads us to our key finding: even more impactful and valued than classification is a new human-AI collaboration approach in which clinician experts interactively query these tools and combine their domain expertise and context about the patient with AI generated reasoning to support clinical decision-making. We find models like GPT-4 correctly reference numerical data 75% of the time, and clinician participants express strong interest in using this approach to interpret self-tracking data",

This paper addresses the underestimation of this privacy in the context of increasing online data sharing and the advancements in information gathering technologies. With the surge in the use of Large Multimodal Models, such as GPT-4, for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), the potential risks associated with geographic privacy breaches have intensified. This study highlights the criticality of these developments, focusing on their implications for individual privacy. The primary objective is to demonstrate the capabilities of advanced AI tools, specifically a GPT-4 based model named \"Dr. Watson,\" in identifying and potentially compromising geographic privacy through online shared content. We developed \"Dr. Watson\" to analyze and extract geographic information from publicly available data sources. The study involved five experimental cases, each offering different perspectives on the tool's application in extracting precise location data from partial images and social media content. The experiments revealed that \"Dr. Watson\" could successfully identify specific geographic details, thereby exposing the vulnerabilities in current geo-privacy measures. These findings underscore the ease with which geographic information can be unintentionally disclosed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the broader implications of these findings for individuals and the community at large. It emphasizes the urgency for enhanced awareness and protective measures against geo-privacy leakage in the era of advanced AI and widespread social media usage",

    "title": "RLIF: Interactive Imitation Learning as Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Although reinforcement learning methods offer a powerful framework for automatic skill acquisition, for practical learning-based control problems in domains such as robotics, imitation learning often provides a more convenient and accessible alternative. In particular, an interactive imitation learning method such as DAgger, which queries a near-optimal expert to intervene online to collect correction data for addressing the distributional shift challenges that afflict na\\\"ive behavioral cloning, can enjoy good performance both in theory and practice without requiring manually specified reward functions and other components of full reinforcement learning methods. In this paper, we explore how off-policy reinforcement learning can enable improved performance under assumptions that are similar but potentially even more practical than those of interactive imitation learning. Our proposed method uses reinforcement learning with user intervention signals themselves as rewards. This relaxes the assumption that intervening experts in interactive imitation learning should be near-optimal and enables the algorithm to learn behaviors that improve over the potential suboptimal human expert. We also provide a unified framework to analyze our RL method and DAgger; for which we present the asymptotic analysis of the suboptimal gap for both methods as well as the non-asymptotic sample complexity bound of our method. We then evaluate our method on challenging high-dimensional continuous control simulation benchmarks as well as real-world robotic vision-based manipulation tasks. The results show that it strongly outperforms DAgger-like approaches across the different tasks, especially when the intervening experts are suboptimal.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scoring student-drawn models is time-consuming. Recently released GPT-4V provides a unique opportunity to advance scientific modeling practices by leveraging the powerful image processing capability. To test this ability specifically for automatic scoring, we developed a method NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubric Instruction for Few-shot Learning) employing instructional note and rubrics to prompt GPT-4V to score students' drawn models for science phenomena. We randomly selected a set of balanced data (N = 900) that includes student-drawn models for six modeling assessment tasks. Each model received a score from GPT-4V ranging at three levels: 'Beginning,' 'Developing,' or 'Proficient' according to scoring rubrics. GPT-4V scores were compared with human experts' scores to calculate scoring accuracy. Results show that GPT-4V's average scoring accuracy was mean =.51, SD = .037. Specifically, average scoring accuracy was .64 for the 'Beginning' class, .62 for the 'Developing' class, and .26 for the 'Proficient' class, indicating that more proficient models are more challenging to score. Further qualitative study reveals how GPT-4V retrieves information from image input, including problem context, example evaluations provided by human coders, and students' drawing models. We also uncovered how GPT-4V catches the characteristics of student-drawn models and narrates them in natural language. At last, we demonstrated how GPT-4V assigns scores to student-drawn models according to the given scoring rubric and instructional notes. Our findings suggest that the NERIF is an effective approach for employing GPT-4V to score drawn models. Even though there is space for GPT-4V to improve scoring accuracy, some mis-assigned scores seemed interpretable to experts. The results of this study show that utilizing GPT-4V for automatic scoring of student-drawn models is promising",

    "abstract": "Same-Day Delivery (SDD) services aim to maximize the fulfillment of online orders while minimizing delivery delays but are beset by operational uncertainties such as those in order volumes and courier planning. Our work aims to enhance the operational efficiency of SDD by focusing on the ultra-fast Order Dispatching Problem (ODP), which involves matching and dispatching orders to couriers within a centralized warehouse setting, and completing the delivery within a strict timeline (e.g., within minutes). We introduce important extensions to ultra-fast ODP such as order batching and explicit courier assignments to provide a more realistic representation of dispatching operations and improve delivery efficiency. As a solution method, we primarily focus on NeurADP, a methodology that combines Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and our work constitutes the first application of NeurADP outside of the ride-pool matching problem. NeurADP is particularly suitable for ultra-fast ODP as it addresses complex one-to-many matching and routing intricacies through a neural network-based VFA that captures high-dimensional problem dynamics without requiring manual feature engineering as in generic ADP methods. We test our proposed approach using four distinct realistic datasets tailored for ODP and compare the performance of NeurADP against myopic and DRL baselines by also making use of non-trivial bounds to assess the quality of the policies. Our numerical results indicate that the inclusion of order batching and courier queues enhances the efficiency of delivery operations and that NeurADP significantly outperforms other methods. Detailed sensitivity analysis with important parameters confirms the robustness of NeurADP under different scenarios, including variations in courier numbers, spatial setup, vehicle capacity, and permitted delay time",

Generating highly accurate intrinsic decompositions is an inherently under-constrained task that requires precisely estimating continuous-valued shading and albedo. In this work, we achieve high-resolution intrinsic decomposition by breaking the problem into two parts. First, we present a dense ordinal shading formulation using a shift- and scale-invariant loss in order to estimate ordinal shading cues without restricting the predictions to obey the intrinsic model. We then combine low- and high-resolution ordinal estimations using a second network to generate a shading estimate with both global coherency and local details. We encourage the model to learn an accurate decomposition by computing losses on the estimated shading as well as the albedo implied by the intrinsic model. We develop a straightforward method for generating dense pseudo ground truth using our model's predictions and multi-illumination data, enabling generalization to in-the-wild imagery. We present an exhaustive qualitative and quantitative analysis of our predicted intrinsic components against state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "SPOT! Revisiting Video-Language Models for Event Understanding",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Understanding videos is an important research topic for multimodal learning. Leveraging large-scale datasets of web-crawled video-text pairs as weak supervision has become a pre-training paradigm for learning joint representations and showcased remarkable potential in video understanding tasks. However, videos can be multi-event and multi-grained, while these video-text pairs usually contain only broad-level video captions. This raises a question: with such weak supervision, can video representation in video-language models gain the ability to distinguish even factual discrepancies in textual description and understand fine-grained events? To address this, we introduce SPOT Prober, to benchmark existing video-language models's capacities of distinguishing event-level discrepancies as an indicator of models' event understanding ability. Our approach involves extracting events as tuples (<Subject, Predicate, Object, Attribute, Timestamps>) from videos and generating false event tuples by manipulating tuple components systematically. We reevaluate the existing video-language models with these positive and negative captions and find they fail to distinguish most of the manipulated events. Based on our findings, we propose to plug in these manipulated event captions as hard negative samples and find them effective in enhancing models for event understanding",

    "title": "Digital Twin Framework for Optimal and Autonomous Decision-Making in Cyber-Physical Systems: Enhancing Reliability and Adaptability in the Oil and Gas Industry",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The concept of creating a virtual copy of a complete Cyber-Physical System opens up numerous possibilities, including real-time assessments of the physical environment and continuous learning from the system to provide reliable and precise information. This process, known as the twinning process or the development of a digital twin (DT), has been widely adopted across various industries. However, challenges arise when considering the computational demands of implementing AI models, such as those employed in digital twins, in real-time information exchange scenarios. This work proposes a digital twin framework for optimal and autonomous decision-making applied to a gas-lift process in the oil and gas industry, focusing on enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the DT. The framework combines Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo simulations, transfer learning, online learning, and novel strategies to confer cognition to the DT, including model hyperdimensional reduction and cognitive tack. Consequently, creating a framework for efficient, reliable, and trustworthy DT identification was possible. The proposed approach addresses the current gap in the literature regarding integrating various learning techniques and uncertainty management in digital twin strategies. This digital twin framework aims to provide a reliable and efficient system capable of adapting to changing environments and incorporating prediction uncertainty, thus enhancing the overall decision-making process in complex, real-world scenarios. Additionally, this work lays the foundation for further developments in digital twins for process systems engineering, potentially fostering new advancements and applications across various industrial sectors",

Psychometric testing revealed consistent covariation between the external criterion and the focal measure administered across the three conditions, demonstrating the reliability and validity of the LLM-generated variants. Participants found the repeated administration of the standardized questionnaire significantly more repetitive compared to the variants.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to explore the performance of LLMs on misinformation detection tasks. This study stands as the pioneering investigation into the understanding capabilities of multiple LLMs regarding both content and propagation across social media platforms. Our empirical studies on five misinformation detection datasets show that LLMs with diverse prompts achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Besides, we further design four instruction-tuned strategies to enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection. These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple instances or hard instances, and eliminate irrelevant propagation structures, thereby achieving better detection performance. Extensive experiments further demonstrate LLMs would play a better capacity in content and propagation structure under these proposed strategies and achieve promising detection performance.

    "title": "From Concept to Manufacturing: Evaluating Vision-Language Models for Engineering Design",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Engineering Design is undergoing a transformative shift with the advent of AI, marking a new era in how we approach product, system, and service planning. Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in enabling this shift. Yet, with text as their only input modality, they cannot leverage the large body of visual artifacts that engineers have used for centuries and are accustomed to. This gap is addressed with the release of multimodal vision language models, such as GPT-4V, enabling AI to impact many more types of tasks. In light of these advancements, this paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4V, a vision language model, across a wide spectrum of engineering design tasks, categorized into four main areas: Conceptual Design, System-Level and Detailed Design, Manufacturing and Inspection, and Engineering Education Tasks. Our study assesses GPT-4V's capabilities in design tasks such as sketch similarity analysis, concept selection using Pugh Charts, material selection, engineering drawing analysis, CAD generation, topology optimization, design for additive and subtractive manufacturing, spatial reasoning challenges, and textbook problems. Through this structured evaluation, we not only explore GPT-4V's proficiency in handling complex design and manufacturing challenges but also identify its limitations in complex engineering design applications. Our research establishes a foundation for future assessments of vision language models, emphasizing their immense potential for innovating and enhancing the engineering design and manufacturing landscape. It also contributes a set of benchmark testing datasets, with more than 1000 queries, for ongoing advancements and applications in this field",

    "title": "Mobile-Seed: Joint Semantic Segmentation and Boundary Detection for Mobile Robots",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Precise and rapid delineation of sharp boundaries and robust semantics is essential for numerous downstream robotic tasks, such as robot grasping and manipulation, real-time semantic mapping, and online sensor calibration performed on edge computing units. Although boundary detection and semantic segmentation are complementary tasks, most studies focus on lightweight models for semantic segmentation but overlook the critical role of boundary detection. In this work, we introduce Mobile-Seed, a lightweight, dual-task framework tailored for simultaneous semantic segmentation and boundary detection. Our framework features a two-stream encoder, an active fusion decoder (AFD) and a dual-task regularization approach. The encoder is divided into two pathways: one captures category-aware semantic information, while the other discerns boundaries from multi-scale features. The AFD module dynamically adapts the fusion of semantic and boundary information by learning channel-wise relationships, allowing for precise weight assignment of each channel. Furthermore, we introduce a regularization loss to mitigate the conflicts in dual-task learning and deep diversity supervision. Compared to existing methods, the proposed Mobile-Seed offers a lightweight framework to simultaneously improve semantic segmentation performance and accurately locate object boundaries. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have shown that Mobile-Seed achieves notable improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline by 2.2 percentage points (pp) in mIoU and 4.2 pp in mF-score, while maintaining an online inference speed of 23.9 frames-per-second (FPS) with 1024x2048 resolution input on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Additional experiments on CamVid and PASCAL Context datasets confirm our method's generalizability.

However, LVLMs are still plagued by the two critical issues of object hallucination and factual accuracy, which limit the practicality of LVLMs in different scenarios. Furthermore, previous evaluation methods focus more on the comprehension and reasoning of language content but lack a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal interactions, thereby resulting in potential limitations. To this end, we propose a novel KNVQA-Eval, which is devoted to knowledge-based VQA task evaluation to reflect the factuality of multimodal LVLMs. To ensure the robustness and scalability of the evaluation, we develop a new KNVQA dataset by incorporating human judgment and perception, aiming to evaluate the accuracy of standard answers relative to AI-generated answers in knowledge-based VQA. This work not only comprehensively evaluates the contextual information of LVLMs using reliable human annotations, but also further analyzes the fine-grained capabilities of current methods to reveal potential avenues for subsequent optimization of LVLMs-based estimators. Our proposed VQA-Eval and corresponding dataset KNVQA will facilitate the development of automatic evaluation tools with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, and reproducibility.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Starting with early successes in computer vision tasks, deep learning based techniques have since overtaken state of the art approaches in a multitude of domains. However, it has been demonstrated time and again that these techniques fail to capture semantic context and logical constraints, instead often relying on spurious correlations to arrive at the answer. Since application of deep learning techniques to critical scenarios are dependent on adherence to domain specific constraints, several attempts have been made to address this issue. One limitation holding back a thorough exploration of this area, is a lack of suitable datasets which feature a rich set of rules. In order to address this, we present the ChessVision Dataset, consisting of 200,000+ images of annotated chess games in progress, requiring recreation of the game state from its corresponding image. This is accompanied by a curated set of rules which constrains the set of predictions to \"reasonable\" game states, and are designed to probe key semantic abilities like localization and enumeration. Alongside standard metrics, additional metrics to measure performance with regards to logical consistency is presented. We analyze several popular and state of the art vision models on this task, and show that, although their performance on standard metrics are laudable, they produce a plethora of incoherent results, indicating that this dataset presents a significant challenge for future works",

    "abstract": "When engaging in strategic decision-making, we are frequently confronted with overwhelming information and data. The situation can be further complicated when certain pieces of evidence contradict each other or become paradoxical. The primary challenge is how to determine which information can be trusted when we adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for decision-making. This issue is known as deciding what to decide or Trustworthy AI. However, the AI system itself is often considered an opaque black box. We propose a new approach to address this issue by introducing a novel framework of Trustworthy AI (TAI) encompassing three crucial components of AI: representation space, loss function, and optimizer. Each component is loosely coupled with four TAI properties. Altogether, the framework consists of twelve TAI properties. We aim to use this framework to conduct the TAI experiments by quantitive and qualitative research methods to satisfy TAI properties for the decision-making context. The framework allows us to formulate an optimal prediction model trained by the given dataset for applying the strategic investment decision of credit default swaps (CDS) in the technology sector. Finally, we provide our view of the future direction of TAI research",

    "abstract": "Auction-based Federated Learning (AFL) has emerged as an important research field in recent years. The prevailing strategies for FL model users (MUs) assume that the entire team of the required data owners (DOs) for an FL task must be assembled before training can commence. In practice, an MU can trigger the FL training process multiple times. DOs can thus be gradually recruited over multiple FL model training sessions. Existing bidding strategies for AFL MUs are not designed to handle such scenarios. Therefore, the problem of multi-session AFL remains open. To address this problem, we propose the Multi-session Budget Optimization Strategy for forward Auction-based Federated Learning (MultiBOS-AFL). Based on hierarchical reinforcement learning, MultiBOS-AFL jointly optimizes inter-session budget pacing and intra-session bidding for AFL MUs, with the objective of maximizing the total utility. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets show that it significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art approaches. On average, MultiBOS-AFL achieves 12.28% higher utility, 14.52% more data acquired through auctions for a given budget, and 1.23% higher test accuracy achieved by the resulting FL model compared to the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first budget optimization decision support method with budget pacing capability designed for MUs in multi-session forward auction-based federated learning",

    "title": "Fin-QD: A Computational Design Framework for Soft Grippers: Integrating MAP-Elites and High-fidelity FEM",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Computational design can excite the full potential of soft robotics that has the drawbacks of being highly nonlinear from material, structure, and contact. Up to date, enthusiastic research interests have been demonstrated for individual soft fingers, but the frame design space (how each soft finger is assembled) remains largely unexplored. Computationally design remains challenging for the finger-based soft gripper to grip across multiple geometrical-distinct object types successfully. Including the design space for the gripper frame can bring huge difficulties for conventional optimisation algorithms and fitness calculation methods due to the exponential growth of high-dimensional design space. This work proposes an automated computational design optimisation framework that generates gripper diversity to individually grasp geometrically distinct object types based on a quality-diversity approach. This work first discusses a significantly large design space (28 design parameters) for a finger-based soft gripper, including the rarely-explored design space of finger arrangement that is converted to various configurations to arrange individual soft fingers. Then, a contact-based Finite Element Modelling (FEM) is proposed in SOFA to output high-fidelity grasping data for fitness evaluation and feature measurements. Finally, diverse gripper designs are obtained from the framework while considering features such as the volume and workspace of grippers. This work bridges the gap of computationally exploring the vast design space of finger-based soft grippers while grasping large geometrically distinct object types with a simple control scheme",

    "abstract": "While WangchanBERTa has become the de facto standard in transformer-based Thai language modeling, it still has shortcomings in regard to the understanding of foreign words, most notably English words, which are often borrowed without orthographic assimilation into Thai in many contexts. We identify the lack of foreign vocabulary in WangchanBERTa's tokenizer as the main source of these shortcomings. We then expand WangchanBERTa's vocabulary via vocabulary transfer from XLM-R's pretrained tokenizer and pretrain a new model using the expanded tokenizer, starting from WangchanBERTa's checkpoint, on a new dataset that is larger than the one used to train WangchanBERTa. Our results show that our new pretrained model, PhayaThaiBERT, outperforms WangchanBERTa in many downstream tasks and datasets",

    "title": "Self-Supervised Deconfounding Against Spatio-Temporal Shifts: Theory and Modeling",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "One of the significant barriers to the training of statistical models on knowledge graphs is the difficulty that scientists have in finding the best input data to address their prediction goal. In addition to this, a key challenge is to determine how to manipulate these relational data, which are often in the form of particular triples (i.e., subject, predicate, object), to enable the learning process. Currently, many high-quality catalogs of knowledge graphs, are available. However, their primary goal is the re-usability of these resources, and their interconnection, in the context of the Semantic Web. This paper describes the LiveSchema initiative, namely, a first version of a gateway that has the main scope of leveraging the gold mine of data collected by many existing catalogs collecting relational data like ontologies and knowledge graphs. At the current state, LiveSchema contains - 1000 datasets from 4 main sources and offers some key facilities, which allow to: i) evolving LiveSchema, by aggregating other source catalogs and repositories as input sources; ii) querying all the collected resources; iii) transforming each given dataset into formal concept analysis matrices that enable analysis and visualization services; iv) generating models and tensors from each given dataset",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLM)-based speech synthesis has been widely adopted in zero-shot speech synthesis. However, they require a large-scale data and possess the same limitations as previous autoregressive speech models, including slow inference speed and lack of robustness. This paper proposes HierSpeech++, a fast and strong zero-shot speech synthesizer for text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC). We verified that hierarchical speech synthesis frameworks could significantly improve the robustness and expressiveness of the synthetic speech. Furthermore, we significantly improve the naturalness and speaker similarity of synthetic speech even in zero-shot speech synthesis scenarios. For text-to-speech, we adopt the text-to-vec framework, which generates a self-supervised speech representation and an F0 representation based on text representations and prosody prompts. Then, HierSpeech++ generates speech from the generated vector, F0, and voice prompt. We further introduce a high-efficient speech super-resolution framework from 16 kHz to 48 kHz. The experimental results demonstrated that the hierarchical variational autoencoder could be a strong zero-shot speech synthesizer given that it outperforms LLM-based and diffusion-based models. Moreover, we achieved the first human-level quality zero-shot speech synthesis. Audio samples and source code are available at https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/HierSpeechpp",

    "abstract": "Neglecting the effect that decisions have on individuals (and thus, on the underlying data distribution) when designing algorithmic decision-making policies may increase inequalities and unfairness in the long term - even if fairness considerations were taken in the policy design process. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for achieving long-term group fairness in dynamical systems, in which current decisions may affect an individual's features in the next step, and thus, future decisions. Specifically, our framework allows us to identify a time-independent policy that converges, if deployed, to the targeted fair stationary state of the system in the long term, independently of the initial data distribution. We model the system dynamics with a time-homogeneous Markov chain and optimize the policy leveraging the Markov chain convergence theorem to ensure unique convergence. We provide examples of different targeted fair states of the system, encompassing a range of long-term goals for society and policymakers. Furthermore, we show how our approach facilitates the evaluation of different long-term targets by examining their impact on the group-conditional population distribution in the long term and how it evolves until convergence",

However, providing effective semantic representation is quite challenging in practice. To address this issue, this article takes a crack at exploiting semantic knowledge base (KB) to usher in a new era of generative semantic communication. Via semantic KB, source messages can be characterized in low-dimensional subspaces without compromising their desired meaning, thus significantly enhancing the communication efficiency. The fundamental principle of semantic KB is first introduced, and a generative semantic communication architecture is developed by presenting three sub-KBs, namely source, task, and channel KBs. Then, the detailed construction approaches for each sub-KB are described, followed by their utilization in terms of semantic coding and transmission. A case study is also provided to showcase the superiority of generative semantic communication over conventional syntactic communication and classical semantic communication. In a nutshell, this article establishes a scientific foundation for the exciting uncharted frontier of generative semantic communication",

We address this question by exploring how TRACX2, (French et al., 2011; French \\& Cottrell, 2014; Mareschal \\& French, 2017), a recognition-based, recursive connectionist autoencoder model of chunking and sequence segmentation, which has successfully simulated speech and serial-image processing, might be applied to elementary melody perception. The model, a three-layer autoencoder that recognizes ''chunks'' of short sequences of intervals that have been frequently encountered on input, is trained on the tone intervals of melodically simple French children's songs. It dynamically incorporates the internal representations of these chunks into new input. Its internal representations cluster in a manner that is consistent with ''human-recognizable'' melodic categories. TRACX2 is sensitive to both contour and proximity information in the musical chunks that it encounters in its input. It shows the ''end-of-word'' superiority effect demonstrated by Saffran et al. (1999) for short musical phrases. The overall findings suggest that the recursive autoassociative chunking mechanism, as implemented in TRACX2, may be a general segmentation and chunking mechanism, underlying not only word-and imagechunking, but also elementary melody processing",

This benchmark aggregates high-quality data from a wide range of CTF (Capture-the-Flag) challenges and real-world applications, with annotations for each vulnerable function detailing the vulnerability type and its root cause. Through our experiments encompassing 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based models and static analyzers, we find that several LLMs outperform traditional deep learning approaches in vulnerability detection, revealing an untapped potential in LLMs. This work contributes to the understanding and utilization of LLMs for enhanced software security",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "For intelligent quadcopter UAVs, a robust and reliable autonomous planning system is crucial. Most current trajectory planning methods for UAVs are suitable for static environments but struggle to handle dynamic obstacles, which can pose challenges and even dangers to flight. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A distinction is often drawn between a model's ability to predict a label for an evaluation sample that is directly memorised from highly similar training samples versus an ability to predict the label via some method of generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering, discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two additional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart simple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on some of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is performance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of the evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional training datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of our evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and 25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change in performance",

Leveraging deep learning, computer-aided diagnosis has the potential to alleviate the pathologist scarcity and provide timely clinical analysis.

In response, we propose an adaptive depth-controlled bidirectional diffusion (ADBD) network for image data generation. The domain migration approach can work with small trainset and overcome the diffusion overfitting by source information guidance. Specifically, we developed a hybrid attention strategy to blend global and local attention priorities, which guides the bidirectional diffusion and ensures the migration success. In addition, we developed the adaptive depth-controlled strategy to simulate physiological transformations, capable of yielding unlimited cross-domain intermediate images with corresponding soft labels. ADBD is effective for overcoming pathological image data deficiency and supportable for further pathology-related research",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In the fundamental statistics course, students are taught to remember the well-known saying: \"Correlation is not Causation\". Till now, statistics (i.e., correlation) have developed various successful frameworks, such as Transformer and Pre-training large-scale models, which have stacked multiple parallel self-attention blocks to imitate a wide range of tasks. However, in the causation community, how to build an integrated causal framework still remains an untouched domain despite its excellent intervention capabilities. In this paper, we propose the Causal Graph Routing (CGR) framework, an integrated causal scheme relying entirely on the intervention mechanisms to reveal the cause-effect forces hidden in data. Specifically, CGR is composed of a stack of causal layers. Each layer includes a set of parallel deconfounding blocks from different causal graphs. We combine these blocks via the concept of the proposed sufficient cause, which allows the model to dynamically select the suitable deconfounding methods in each layer. CGR is implemented as the stacked networks, integrating no confounder, back-door adjustment, front-door adjustment, and probability of sufficient cause. We evaluate this framework on two classical tasks of CV and NLP. Experiments show CGR can surpass the current state-of-the-art methods on both Visual Question Answer and Long Document Classification tasks. In particular, CGR has great potential in building the \"causal\" pre-training large-scale model that effectively generalizes to diverse tasks. It will improve the machines' comprehension of causal relationships within a broader semantic space",

First, to explore model-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the RE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards the first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis of TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from the instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the second objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to automatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and reannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is based on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used false-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our second approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean subset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally, we retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset. Our empirical results based on two SOTA models trained on TACRED-E following the IS show an average 4% F1-score improvement, whereas reannotation (TACRED-R) does not improve the original results. However, following ES, SOTA models show the average F1-score improvement of 3.8% and 4.4% when trained on respective eliminated (TACRED-EN) and reannotated (TACRED-RN) datasets respectively. We further extended the ES for cleaning positive examples as well, which resulted in an average performance improvement of 5.8% and 5.6% for the eliminated (TACRED-ENP) and reannotated (TACRED-RNP) datasets respectively",

    "title": "ATLANTIC: Structure-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Interdisciplinary Science",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship, etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g., Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that include science question-answering and scientific document classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) heralds a pivotal shift in online user interactions with information. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) systems primarily relied on query-document matching, whereas LLMs excel in comprehending and generating human-like text, thereby enriching the IR experience significantly. While LLMs are often associated with chatbot functionalities, this paper extends the discussion to their explicit application in information retrieval. We explore methodologies to optimize the retrieval process, select optimal models, and effectively scale and orchestrate LLMs, aiming for cost-efficiency and enhanced result accuracy. A notable challenge, model hallucination-where the model yields inaccurate or misinterpreted data-is addressed alongside other model-specific hurdles. Our discourse extends to crucial considerations including user privacy, data optimization, and the necessity for system clarity and interpretability. Through a comprehensive examination, we unveil not only innovative strategies for integrating Language Models (LLMs) with Information Retrieval (IR) systems, but also the consequential considerations that underline the need for a balanced approach aligned with user-centric principles",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Assortment planning, integral to multiple commercial offerings, is a key problem studied in e-commerce and retail settings. Numerous variants of the problem along with their integration into business solutions have been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. However, the nuanced complexities of in-store planning and a lack of optimization proficiency among store planners with strong domain expertise remain largely overlooked. These challenges frequently necessitate collaborative efforts with multiple stakeholders which often lead to prolonged decision-making processes and significant delays. To mitigate these challenges and capitalize on the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose an interactive assortment planning framework, InteraSSort that augments LLMs with optimization tools to assist store planners in making decisions through interactive conversations. Specifically, we develop a solution featuring a user-friendly interface that enables users to express their optimization objectives as input text prompts to InteraSSort and receive tailored optimized solutions as output. Our framework extends beyond basic functionality by enabling the inclusion of additional constraints through interactive conversation, facilitating precise and highly customized decision-making. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and potential extensions to a broad range of operations management challenges",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent years witnessed a rising interest towards Datalog-based ontological reasoning systems, both in academia and industry. These systems adopt languages, often shared under the collective name of Datalog$+/-$, that extend Datalog with the essential feature of existential quantification, while introducing syntactic limitations to sustain reasoning decidability and achieve a good trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. From an implementation perspective, modern reasoners borrow the vast experience of the database community in developing streaming-based data processing systems, such as volcano-iterator architectures, that sustain a limited memory footprint and good scalability. In this paper, we focus on two extremely promising, expressive, and tractable languages, namely, Shy and Warded Datalog$+/-$. We leverage their theoretical underpinnings to introduce novel reasoning techniques, technically, \"chase variants\", that are particularly fit for efficient reasoning in streaming-based architectures. We then implement them in Vadalog, our reference streaming-based engine, to efficiently solve ontological reasoning tasks over real-world settings",

In this work, we present NeuroPrompts, an adaptive framework that automatically enhances a user's prompt to improve the quality of generations produced by text-to-image models. Our framework utilizes constrained text decoding with a pre-trained language model that has been adapted to generate prompts similar to those produced by human prompt engineers. This approach enables higher-quality text-to-image generations and provides user control over stylistic features via constraint set specification. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by creating an interactive application for prompt enhancement and image generation using Stable Diffusion. Additionally, we conduct experiments utilizing a large dataset of human-engineered prompts for text-to-image generation and show that our approach automatically produces enhanced prompts that result in superior image quality.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based user-centric approach for processing sensing data in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with high accuracy and efficient resource utilization. The considered scenario involves an ISAC device with a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) and a mobile edge computing (MEC) server with a large DNN. After collecting sensing data, the ISAC device either processes the data locally or uploads them to the server for higher-accuracy data processing. To cope with data drifts, the server updates the lightweight DNN when necessary, referred to as continual learning. Our objective is to minimize the long-term average computation cost of the MEC server by optimizing two decisions, i.e., sensing data offloading and sensing data selection for the DNN update. A DT of the ISAC device is constructed to predict the impact of potential decisions on the long-term computation cost of the server, based on which the decisions are made with closed-form formulas. Experiments on executing DNN-based human motion recognition tasks are conducted to demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed DT-based approach in computation cost minimization",

Then, we introduce a new notion of defense equivalence of AFs, and compare defense equivalence with standard equivalence and strong equivalence, respectively. Finally, by exploiting defense semantics, we define two kinds of reasons for accepting arguments, i.e., direct reasons and root reasons, and a notion of root equivalence of AFs that can be used in argumentation summarization",

In particular, we ask ChatGPT to give examples of how to use Bayes rule for medical diagnosis. Our prompts range from queries that use terminology from pure probability (e.g., requests for a \"posterior probability\") to queries that use terminology from the medical diagnosis literature (e.g., requests for a \"post-test probability\"). We show how the introduction of medical variable names leads to an increase in the number of errors that ChatGPT makes.

    "title": "Common (good) practices measuring trust in HRI",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Trust in robots is widely believed to be imperative for the adoption of robots into people's daily lives. It is, therefore, understandable that the literature of the last few decades focuses on measuring how much people trust robots -- and more generally, any agent - to foster such trust in these technologies. Researchers have been exploring how people trust robot in different ways, such as measuring trust on human-robot interactions (HRI) based on textual descriptions or images without any physical contact, during and after interacting with the technology. Nevertheless, trust is a complex behaviour, and it is affected and depends on several factors, including those related to the interacting agents (e.g. humans, robots, pets), itself (e.g. capabilities, reliability), the context (e.g. task), and the environment (e.g. public spaces vs private spaces vs working spaces). In general, most roboticists agree that insufficient levels of trust lead to a risk of disengagement while over-trust in technology can cause over-reliance and inherit dangers, for example, in emergency situations. It is, therefore, very important that the research community has access to reliable methods to measure people's trust in robots and technology. In this position paper, we outline current methods and their strengths, identify (some) weakly covered aspects and discuss the potential for covering a more comprehensive amount of factors influencing trust in HRI",

We relax the intrinsic model bias (i.e. using MLPs to encode local features as opposed to convolutions) and constrain the hypothesis space instead with an auxiliary regularization related to the reconstruction task, i.e. denoising. The resulting model is the first only-MLP locally conditioned implicit shape reconstruction from point cloud network with fast feed forward inference. Point cloud borne features and denoising offsets are predicted from an exclusively MLP-made network in a single forward pass. A decoder predicts occupancy probabilities for queries anywhere in space by pooling nearby features from the point cloud order-invariantly, guided by denoised relative positional encoding.

However, few datasets exist to categorize visual features and objects available to dogs, as well as how dogs direct their visual attention within their environment. We collect and study a dataset with over 11,698 gazes to categorize the objects available to be gazed at by 11 dogs in everyday outdoor environments i.e. a walk around a college campus and urban area. We explore the availability of these object categories and the visual attention of dogs over these categories using a head mounted eye tracking apparatus. A small portion (approx. 600 images or < 20% of total dataset) of the collected data is used to fine tune a MaskRCNN for the novel image domain to segment objects present in the scene, enabling further statistical analysis on the visual gaze tendencies of dogs. The MaskRCNN, with eye tracking apparatus, serves as an end to end model for automatically classifying the visual fixations of dogs. The fine tuned MaskRCNN performs far better than chance. There are few individual differences between the 11 dogs and we observe greater visual fixations on buses, plants, pavement, and construction equipment.

The reason of the reduced performance can be manifold. It could be induced by the user, environment, and device variations in realistic scenarios. Such scenarios are often more complex and diverse, which can be challenging to anticipate in the initial training data.

We plan to situate this system in a refinement-based approach, where a user writes a constraint specification describing a problem above the level of abstraction at which many modelling decisions are made.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions have dramatically risen since the early 1900s with U.S. transportation generating 28% of the U.S' emissions. As such, there is interest in reducing transportation-related emissions. Specifically, sustainability research has sprouted around signalized intersections as intersections allow different streams of traffic to cross and change directions. Recent research has developed mixed traffic control eco-driving strategies at signalized intersections to decrease emissions. However, the inherent structure of a signalized intersection generates increased emissions by creating frequent acceleration/deceleration events, excessive idling from traffic congestion, and stop-and-go waves. Thus, we believe unsignalized intersections hold potential for further sustainability improvements. In this work, we provide an emissions analysis on unsignalized intersections with complex, real-world topologies and traffic demands where mixed traffic control strategies are employed by robot vehicles (RVs) to reduce waiting times and congestion. We find with at least 10% RV penetration rate, RVs generate less fuel consumption and NOx emissions than signalized intersections by up to 27% and 28%, respectively. With at least 30% RVs, CO and HC emissions are reduced by up to 42% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, RVs can reduce emissions across the whole network despite only employing their strategies at the intersections",

    "title": "Generating Valid and Natural Adversarial Examples with Large Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based natural language processing (NLP) models, particularly pre-trained language models (PLMs), have been revealed to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, the adversarial examples generated by many mainstream word-level adversarial attack models are neither valid nor natural, leading to the loss of semantic maintenance, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility. Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin. The model can generate adversarial examples that are typically valid and natural, with the preservation of semantic meaning, grammaticality, and human imperceptibility",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The customization of recommended content to users holds significant importance in enhancing user experiences across a wide spectrum of applications such as e-commerce, music, and shopping. Graph-based methods have achieved considerable performance by capturing user-item interactions. However, these methods tend to utilize randomly constructed embeddings in the dataset used for training the recommender, which lacks any user preferences. Here, we propose the concept of variational embeddings as a means of pre-training the recommender system to improve the feature propagation through the layers of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The graph variational embedding collaborative filtering (GVECF) is introduced as a novel framework to incorporate representations learned through a variational graph auto-encoder which are embedded into a GCN-based collaborative filtering. This approach effectively transforms latent high-order user-item interactions into more trainable vectors, ultimately resulting in better performance in terms of recall and normalized discounted cumulative gain(NDCG) metrics. The experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves up to 13.78% improvement in the recall over the test data",

The unique characteristic enables DocPedia to capture a greater amount of visual and textual information using a limited number of visual tokens. To consistently enhance both perception and comprehension abilities of our model, we develop a dual-stage training strategy and enrich instructions/annotations of all training tasks covering multiple document types. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on various publicly available benchmarks confirm the mutual benefits of jointly learning perception and comprehension tasks.

Despite this, routing algorithms and applications are usually developed for a general purpose, meaning that certain groups, such as ageing people, are often marginalized due to the broad approach of the designed algorithms. This situation may pose a problem in cities which are suffering a slow but progressive ageing of their populations. With this motivation in mind, this paper focuses on describing our implemented Age-Friendly Route Planner, whose goal is to improve the experience in the city for senior citizens. In order to measure the age-friendliness of a route, several variables have been deemed, such as the number of amenities along the route, the amount of comfortable elements found, or the avoidance of sloppy sections. In this paper, we describe one of the main features of the Age-Friendly Route Planner: the preference-based routes, and we also demonstrate how it can contribute to the creation of adapted friendly routes",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

However, existing model architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet and ConvNeXt often underperform on smaller, specialised datasets typical of such projects.

Utilising a novel dataset of infrared cocoa tree images, we demonstrate PhytNet's development and compare its performance with existing architectures. Data collection was informed by analysis of spectroscopy data, which provided useful insights into the spectral characteristics of cocoa trees. Such information could inform future data collection and model development. Cocoa was chosen as a focal species due to the diverse pathology of its diseases, which pose significant challenges for detection. ResNet18 showed some signs of overfitting, while EfficientNet variants showed distinct signs of overfitting. By contrast, PhytNet displayed excellent attention to relevant features, no overfitting, and an exceptionally low computation cost (1.19 GFLOPS). As such PhytNet is a promising candidate for rapid disease or plant classification, or precise localisation of disease symptoms for autonomous systems",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Background and objectives: Dynamic handwriting analysis, due to its non-invasive and readily accessible nature, has recently emerged as a vital adjunctive method for the early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we design a compact and efficient network architecture to analyse the distinctive handwriting patterns of patients' dynamic handwriting signals, thereby providing an objective identification for the Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Methods: The proposed network is based on a hybrid deep learning approach that fully leverages the advantages of both long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the LSTM block is adopted to extract the time-varying features, while the CNN-based block is implemented using one-dimensional convolution for low computational cost. Moreover, the hybrid model architecture is continuously refined under ablation studies for superior performance. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method with its generalization under a five-fold cross-validation, which validates its efficiency and robustness. Results: The proposed network demonstrates its versatility by achieving impressive classification accuracies on both our new DraWritePD dataset ($96.2\\%$) and the well-established PaHaW dataset ($90.7\\%$). Moreover, the network architecture also stands out for its excellent lightweight design, occupying a mere $0.084$M of parameters, with a total of only $0.59$M floating-point operations. It also exhibits near real-time CPU inference performance, with inference times ranging from $0.106$ to $0.220$s. Conclusions: We present a series of experiments with extensive analysis, which systematically demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid neural network in extracting distinctive handwriting patterns for precise diagnosis of Parkinson's disease",

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmentation has become an effective solution to empower large language models (LLMs) with external and verified knowledge sources from the database, which overcomes the limitations and hallucinations of LLMs in handling up-to-date and domain-specific information. However, existing embedding models for text retrieval usually have three non-negligible limitations. First, the number and diversity of samples in a batch are too restricted to supervise the modeling of textual nuances at scale. Second, the high proportional noise are detrimental to the semantic correctness and consistency of embeddings. Third, the equal treatment to easy and difficult samples would cause sub-optimum convergence of embeddings with poorer generalization. In this paper, we propose the PEG, a progressively learned embeddings for robust text retrieval. Specifically, we increase the training in-batch negative samples to 80,000, and for each query, we extracted five hard negatives. Concurrently, we incorporated a progressive learning mechanism, enabling the model to dynamically modulate its attention to the samples throughout the entire training process. Additionally, PEG is trained on more than 100 million data, encompassing a wide range of domains (e.g., finance, medicine, and tourism) and covering various tasks (e.g., question-answering, machine reading comprehension, and similarity matching). Extensive experiments conducted on C-MTEB and DuReader demonstrate that PEG surpasses state-of-the-art embeddings in retrieving true positives, highlighting its significant potential for applications in LLMs. Our model is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/TownsWu/PEG",

    "abstract": "A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery from observational data is pivotal for deciphering complex relationships. Causal Structure Learning (CSL), which focuses on deriving causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) from data, faces challenges due to vast DAG spaces and data sparsity. The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), recognized for their causal reasoning capabilities, offers a promising direction to enhance CSL by infusing it with knowledge-based causal inferences. However, existing approaches utilizing LLMs for CSL have encountered issues, including unreliable constraints from imperfect LLM inferences and the computational intensity of full pairwise variable analyses. In response, we introduce the Iterative LLM Supervised CSL (ILS-CSL) framework. ILS-CSL innovatively integrates LLM-based causal inference with CSL in an iterative process, refining the causal DAG using feedback from LLMs. This method not only utilizes LLM resources more efficiently but also generates more robust and high-quality structural constraints compared to previous methodologies. Our comprehensive evaluation across eight real-world datasets demonstrates ILS-CSL's superior performance, setting a new standard in CSL efficacy and showcasing its potential to significantly advance the field of causal discovery.

Most of them generally focus on one of these perspectives and may fail to fully exploit the relationships across different dimensions. To address this issue, this paper introduces a convolutional mixer for video prediction, termed ViP-Mixer, to model the spatiotemporal evolution in the latent space of an autoencoder. The ViP-Mixers are stacked sequentially and interleave feature mixing at three levels: frames, channels, and locations.

    "abstract": "The rapidly emerging field of deep learning-based computational pathology has shown promising results in utilizing whole slide images (WSIs) to objectively prognosticate cancer patients. However, most prognostic methods are currently limited to either histopathology or genomics alone, which inevitably reduces their potential to accurately predict patient prognosis. Whereas integrating WSIs and genomic features presents three main challenges: (1) the enormous heterogeneity of gigapixel WSIs which can reach sizes as large as 150,000x150,000 pixels; (2) the absence of a spatially corresponding relationship between histopathology images and genomic molecular data; and (3) the existing early, late, and intermediate multimodal feature fusion strategies struggle to capture the explicit interactions between WSIs and genomics. To ameliorate these issues, we propose the Mutual-Guided Cross-Modality Transformer (MGCT), a weakly-supervised, attention-based multimodal learning framework that can combine histology features and genomic features to model the genotype-phenotype interactions within the tumor microenvironment. To validate the effectiveness of MGCT, we conduct experiments using nearly 3,600 gigapixel WSIs across five different cancer types sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Extensive experimental results consistently emphasize that MGCT outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods",

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence is a concept aimed at making complex algorithms transparent to users through a uniform solution. Researchers have highlighted the importance of integrating domain specific contexts to develop explanations tailored to end users. In this study, we focus on the Schufa housing scoring system in Germany and investigate how users information needs and expectations for explanations vary based on their roles. Using the speculative design approach, we asked business information students to imagine user interfaces that provide housing credit score explanations from the perspectives of both tenants and landlords. Our preliminary findings suggest that although there are general needs that apply to all users, there are also conflicting needs that depend on the practical realities of their roles and how credit scores affect them. We contribute to Human centered XAI research by proposing future research directions that examine users explanatory needs considering their roles and agencies",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The creation of news timeline is essential for a comprehensive and contextual understanding of events as they unfold over time. This approach aids in discerning patterns and trends that might be obscured when news is viewed in isolation. By organizing news in a chronological sequence, it becomes easier to track the development of stories, understand the interrelation of events, and grasp the broader implications of news items. This is particularly helpful in sectors like finance and insurance, where timely understanding of the event development-ranging from extreme weather to political upheavals and health crises-is indispensable for effective risk management. While traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques have had some success, they often fail to capture the news with nuanced relevance that are readily apparent to domain experts, hindering broader industry integration. The advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a renewed opportunity to tackle this challenge. However, direct prompting LLMs for this task is often ineffective. Our study investigates the application of an extended task prompting technique to assess past news relevance. We demonstrate that enhancing conventional prompts with additional tasks boosts their effectiveness on various news dataset, rendering news timeline generation practical for professional use.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The application of LLMs to specific domains, such as biomedicine, has achieved increased attention. However, most biomedical LLMs focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation tasks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the LLMs on diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, we present Taiyi, a bilingual (English and Chinese) fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. In this work, we first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text mining datasets across over 10 task types. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification, question answering tasks demonstrate Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyi's considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Embedded devices are specialised devices designed for one or only a few purposes. They are often part of a larger system, through wired or wireless connection. Those embedded devices that are connected to other computers or embedded systems through the Internet are called Internet of Things (IoT for short) devices. With their widespread usage and their insufficient protection, these devices are increasingly becoming the target of malware attacks. Companies often cut corners to save manufacturing costs or misconfigure when producing these devices. This can be lack of software updates, ports left open or security defects by design. Although these devices may not be as powerful as a regular computer, their large number makes them suitable candidates for botnets. Other types of IoT devices can even cause health problems since there are even pacemakers connected to the Internet. This means, that without sufficient defence, even directed assaults are possible against people. The goal of this thesis project is to provide better security for these devices with the help of machine learning algorithms and reverse engineering tools. Specifically, I study the applicability of control-flow related data of executables for malware detection. I present a malware detection method with two phases. The first phase extracts control-flow related data using static binary analysis. The second phase classifies binary executables as either malicious or benign using a neural network model. I train the model using a dataset of malicious and benign ARM applications",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In general, deep learning-based video frame interpolation (VFI) methods have predominantly focused on estimating motion vectors between two input frames and warping them to the target time. While this approach has shown impressive performance for linear motion between two input frames, it exhibits limitations when dealing with occlusions and nonlinear movements. Recently, generative models have been applied to VFI to address these issues. However, as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images, but rather on predicting accurate intermediate frames between two given frames, performance limitations still persist. In this paper, we propose a multi-in-single-out (MISO) based VFI method that does not rely on motion vector estimation, allowing it to effectively model occlusions and nonlinear motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel motion perceptual loss that enables MISO-VFI to better capture the spatio-temporal correlations within the video frames. Our MISO-VFI method achieves state-of-the-art results on VFI benchmarks Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101, with a significant performance gap compared to existing approaches",

    "title": "Advancing Urban Renewal: An Automated Approach to Generating Historical Arcade Facades with Stable Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Urban renewal and transformation processes necessitate the preservation of the historical urban fabric, particularly in districts known for their architectural and historical significance. These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts",

Current works have significantly advanced the problem in terms of model and data. However, the overall performance of most FSOD methods still does not fulfill the desired accuracy. In this paper we improve the FSOD model to address the severe issue of sample imbalance and weak feature propagation. To alleviate modeling bias from data-sufficient base classes, we examine the effect of decoupling the parameters for classes with sufficient data and classes with few samples in various ways. We design a base-novel categories decoupled DETR (DeDETR) for FSOD. We also explore various types of skip connection between the encoder and decoder for DETR. Besides, we notice that the best outputs could come from the intermediate layer of the decoder instead of the last layer; therefore, we build a unified decoder module that could dynamically fuse the decoder layers as the output feature. We evaluate our model on commonly used datasets such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. Our results indicate that our proposed module could achieve stable improvements of 5% to 10% in both fine-tuning and meta-learning paradigms and has outperformed the highest score in recent works",

    "abstract": "Context and motivation: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Their application in Requirements Engineering (RE), especially in requirements classification, has gained increasing interest. Question/problem: In our research, we conducted an extensive empirical evaluation of ChatGPT models including text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, and gpt-4 in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for requirements classification. The question arises as to how these models compare to traditional classification methods, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Principal ideas/results: Based on five diverse datasets, our results show that ChatGPT consistently outperforms LSTM, and while ChatGPT is more effective than SVM in classifying functional requirements (FR), SVM is better in classifying non-functional requirements (NFR). Our results also show that contrary to our expectations, the few-shot setting does not always lead to enhanced performance; in most instances, it was found to be suboptimal.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Our focus is on projects, i.e., business processes, which are emerging as the economic drivers of our times. Differently from day-to-day operational processes that do not require detailed planning, a project requires planning and resource-constrained scheduling for coordinating resources across sub- or related projects and organizations. A planner in charge of project planning has to select a set of activities to perform, determine their precedence constraints, and schedule them according to temporal project constraints. We suggest a data-driven project planning approach for classes of projects such as infrastructure building and information systems development projects. A project network is first learned from historical records. The discovered network relaxes temporal constraints embedded in individual projects, thus uncovering where planning and scheduling flexibility can be exploited for greater benefit. Then, the network, which contains multiple project plan variations, from which one has to be selected, is enriched by identifying decision rules and frequent paths. The planner can rely on the project network for: 1) decoding a project variation such that it forms a new project plan, and 2) applying resource-constrained project scheduling procedures to determine the project's schedule and resource allocation. Using two real-world project datasets, we show that the suggested approach may provide the planner with significant flexibility (up to a 26% reduction of the critical path of a real project) to adjust the project plan and schedule. We believe that the proposed approach can play an important part in supporting decision making towards automated data-driven project planning",

Some examples are used to illustrate the comparison results of the proposed algorithm and some exist-ing methods. The comparison result shows that the proposed algorithm is effective and can identify the optimal scheme accurately. In medical diagnosis area, it can be used to quickly diagnose disease.

While traditional predictive models, grounded in simulation, hold theoretical robustness, they grapple with challenges, notably the assimilation of imprecise data and extensive computational complexities. In recent years, Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) has been adopted to develop Machine Learning (ML)-enabled magnetometer systems for predicting real-time terrestrial magnetic perturbations as a proxy measure for GIC. While TinyML offers efficient, real-time data processing, its intrinsic limitations prevent the utilization of robust methods with high computational needs. This paper developed a physics-guided TinyML framework to address the above challenges. This framework integrates physics-based regularization at the stages of model training and compression, thereby augmenting the reliability of predictions. The developed pruning scheme within the framework harnesses the inherent physical characteristics of the domain, striking a balance between model size and robustness. The study presents empirical results, drawing a comprehensive comparison between the accuracy and reliability of the developed framework and its traditional counterpart.

Any optimization method (e.g., Adam) which uses decoupled weight decay regularization (respectively, AdamW) can be viewed as a particular case of a more general algorithm with weight norm control (respectively, AdamWN). We argue that setting the target norm of weights to 0 can be suboptimal and other target norm values can be considered. For instance, any training run where AdamW achieves a particular norm of weights can be challenged by AdamWN scheduled to achieve a comparable norm of weights. We discuss various implications of introducing weight norm control instead of weight decay",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A multitude of (dis)similarity measures between neural network representations have been proposed, resulting in a fragmented research landscape. Most of these measures fall into one of two categories. First, measures such as linear regression, canonical correlations analysis (CCA), and shape distances, all learn explicit mappings between neural units to quantify similarity while accounting for expected invariances. Second, measures such as representational similarity analysis (RSA), centered kernel alignment (CKA), and normalized Bures similarity (NBS) all quantify similarity in summary statistics, such as stimulus-by-stimulus kernel matrices, which are already invariant to expected symmetries. Here, we take steps towards unifying these two broad categories of methods by observing that the cosine of the Riemannian shape distance (from category 1) is equal to NBS (from category 2). We explore how this connection leads to new interpretations of shape distances and NBS, and draw contrasts of these measures with CKA, a popular similarity measure in the deep learning literature",

With Smaragdine, the energy consumption of a DL program can be broken down into units aligned with its logical hierarchical decomposition structure. We apply Smaragdine for understanding the energy behavior of BERT, one of the most widely used language models. Layer-by-layer and tensor-by-tensor, Smaragdine is capable of identifying the highest energy/power-consuming components of BERT.

In this work, we first investigate the use of \\emph{offline} RL algorithms in solving the RRM problem. We evaluate several state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms, including behavior constrained Q-learning (BCQ), conservative Q-learning (CQL), and implicit Q-learning (IQL), for a specific RRM problem that aims at maximizing a linear combination {of sum and} 5-percentile rates via user scheduling. We observe that the performance of offline RL for the RRM problem depends critically on the behavior policy used for data collection, and further propose a novel offline RL solution that leverages heterogeneous datasets collected by different behavior policies. We show that with a proper mixture of the datasets, offline RL can produce a near-optimal RL policy even when all involved behavior policies are highly suboptimal",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There exist a wide range of single number metrics for assessing performance of classification algorithms, including AUC and the F1-score (Wikipedia lists 17 such metrics, with 27 different names). In this article, I propose a new metric to answer the following question: when an algorithm is tuned so that it can no longer distinguish labelled cats from real cats, how often does a randomly chosen image that has been labelled as containing a cat actually contain a cat? The steps to construct this metric are as follows. First, we set a threshold score such that when the algorithm is shown two randomly-chosen images -- one that has a score greater than the threshold (i.e. a picture labelled as containing a cat) and another from those pictures that really does contain a cat -- the probability that the image with the highest score is the one chosen from the set of real cat images is 50\\%. At this decision threshold, the set of positively labelled images are indistinguishable from the set of images which are positive. Then, as a second step, we measure performance by asking how often a randomly chosen picture from those labelled as containing a cat actually contains a cat. This metric can be thought of as {\\it precision at the indistinguishability threshold}. While this new metric doesn't address the tradeoff between precision and recall inherent to all such metrics, I do show why this method avoids pitfalls that can occur when using, for example AUC, and it is better motivated than, for example, the F1-score",

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) allows applications such as user personalization and household robots to learn on the fly and adapt to context. This is an important feature when context, actions, and users change. However, enabling CL on resource-constrained embedded systems is challenging due to the limited labeled data, memory, and computing capacity. In this paper, we propose LifeLearner, a hardware-aware meta continual learning system that drastically optimizes system resources (lower memory, latency, energy consumption) while ensuring high accuracy. Specifically, we (1) exploit meta-learning and rehearsal strategies to explicitly cope with data scarcity issues and ensure high accuracy, (2) effectively combine lossless and lossy compression to significantly reduce the resource requirements of CL and rehearsal samples, and (3) developed hardware-aware system on embedded and IoT platforms considering the hardware characteristics. As a result, LifeLearner achieves near-optimal CL performance, falling short by only 2.8% on accuracy compared to an Oracle baseline. With respect to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) Meta CL method, LifeLearner drastically reduces the memory footprint (by 178.7x), end-to-end latency by 80.8-94.2%, and energy consumption by 80.9-94.2%. In addition, we successfully deployed LifeLearner on two edge devices and a microcontroller unit, thereby enabling efficient CL on resource-constrained platforms where it would be impractical to run SOTA methods and the far-reaching deployment of adaptable CL in a ubiquitous manner.

    "abstract": "Traditional model-based image reconstruction (MBIR) methods combine forward and noise models with simple object priors. Recent application of deep learning methods for image reconstruction provides a successful data-driven approach to addressing the challenges when reconstructing images with undersampled measurements or various types of noise. In this work, we propose a hybrid supervised-unsupervised learning framework for X-ray computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction. The proposed learning formulation leverages both sparsity or unsupervised learning-based priors and neural network reconstructors to simulate a fixed-point iteration process. Each proposed trained block consists of a deterministic MBIR solver and a neural network. The information flows in parallel through these two reconstructors and is then optimally combined. Multiple such blocks are cascaded to form a reconstruction pipeline. We demonstrate the efficacy of this learned hybrid model for low-dose CT image reconstruction with limited training data, where we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we study combinations of supervised deep network reconstructors and MBIR solver with learned sparse representation-based priors or analytical priors. Our results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed framework compared to recent low-dose CT reconstruction methods",

We tackle a significant challenge for pre-training a general time-series model from multiple heterogeneous time-series dataset: providing semantically useful inputs to models for modeling time series of different dynamics from different domains. We observe that partitioning time-series into segments as inputs to sequential models produces semantically better inputs and propose a novel model LPTM that automatically identifies optimal dataset-specific segmentation strategy leveraging self-supervised learning loss during pre-training. LPTM provides performance similar to or better than domain-specific state-of-art model and is significantly more data and compute efficient taking up to 40% less data as well as 50% less training time to achieve state-of-art performance in a wide range of time-series analysis tasks from multiple disparate domain",

    "abstract": "Overfitting is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model is trained for too long and focused too much on the exact fitness of the training samples to the provided training labels and cannot keep track of the predictive rules that would be useful on the test data. This phenomenon is commonly attributed to memorization of particular samples, memorization of the noise, and forced fitness into a data set of limited samples by using a high number of neurons. While it is true that the model encodes various peculiarities as the training process continues, we argue that most of the overfitting occurs in the process of reconciling sharply defined membership ratios. In this study, we present an approach that increases the classification accuracy of machine learning models by allowing the model to negotiate output representations of the samples with previously determined class labels. By setting up a negotiation between the models interpretation of the inputs and the provided labels, we not only increased average classification accuracy but also decreased the rate of overfitting without applying any other regularization tricks. By implementing our negotiation paradigm approach to several low regime machine learning problems by generating overfitting scenarios from publicly available data sets such as CIFAR 10, CIFAR 100, and MNIST we have demonstrated that the proposed paradigm has more capacity than its intended purpose. We are sharing the experimental results and inviting the machine learning community to explore the limits of the proposed paradigm. We also aim to incentive the community to exploit the negotiation paradigm to overcome the learning related challenges in other research fields such as continual learning.

Here we provide a solution to this dilemma, by algorithmically reinterpreting the ALIF model, reducing the sequential simulation complexity and permitting a more efficient parallelisation on GPUs. We computationally validate our implementation to obtain over a $50\\times$ training speedup using small DTs on synthetic benchmarks. We also obtained a comparable performance to the standard ALIF implementation on different supervised classification tasks - yet in a fraction of the training time.

However, most of these methods rely on pairwise relations in the graph and do not capture the underling higher-order relations between entities. Hypergraphs are versatile and expressive structures that can effectively model higher-order relationships among entities in the data. Despite the efforts to adapt GNNs to hypergraphs (HyperGNN), there are currently no fully self-supervised pretraining methods for HyperGNN on heterogeneous hypergraphs. In this paper, we present SPHH, a novel self-supervised pretraining framework for heterogeneous HyperGNNs. Our method is able to effectively capture higher-order relations among entities in the data in a self-supervised manner. SPHH is consist of two self-supervised pretraining tasks that aim to simultaneously learn both local and global representations of the entities in the hypergraph by using informative representations derived from the hypergraph structure. Overall, our work presents a significant advancement in the field of self-supervised pretraining of HyperGNNs, and has the potential to improve the performance of various graph-based downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction tasks which are mapped to hypergraph configuration. Our experiments on two real-world benchmarks using four different HyperGNN models show that our proposed SPHH framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various downstream tasks.

Recent advances in evidential deep learning shed light on the direct quantification of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with a single forward pass of the model. Most traditional approaches adopt an entropy-based method to derive evidential uncertainty in classification, quantifying uncertainty at the sample level. However, the variance-based method that has been widely applied in regression problems is seldom used in the classification setting. In this work, we adapt the variance-based approach from regression to classification, quantifying classification uncertainty at the class level. The variance decomposition technique in regression is extended to class covariance decomposition in classification based on the law of total covariance, and the class correlation is also derived from the covariance. Experiments on cross-domain datasets are conducted to illustrate that the variance-based approach not only results in similar accuracy as the entropy-based one in active domain adaptation but also brings information about class-wise uncertainties as well as between-class correlations.

Existing algorithmic recourse approaches often assume an invariant predictive model; however, the predictive model is usually updated upon the arrival of new data. Thus, a recourse that is valid respective to the present model may become invalid for the future model. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework to generate a model-agnostic recourse that exhibits robustness to model shifts. Our framework first builds a coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate of the nonlinear (black-box) model; then, the recourse is generated with respect to the linear surrogate. We establish a theoretical connection between our coverage-validity-aware linear surrogate and the minimax probability machines (MPM). We then prove that by prescribing different covariance robustness, the proposed framework recovers popular regularizations for MPM, including the $\\ell_2$-regularization and class-reweighting. Furthermore, we show that our surrogate pushes the approximate hyperplane intuitively, facilitating not only robust but also interpretable recourses. The numerical results demonstrate the usefulness and robustness of our framework",

    "abstract": "In materials science, the challenge of rapid prototyping materials with desired properties often involves extensive experimentation to find suitable microstructures. Additionally, finding microstructures for given properties is typically an ill-posed problem where multiple solutions may exist. Using generative machine learning models can be a viable solution which also reduces the computational cost. This comes with new challenges because, e.g., a continuous property variable as conditioning input to the model is required. We investigate the shortcomings of an existing method and compare this to a novel embedding strategy for generative models that is based on the binary representation of floating point numbers. This eliminates the need for normalization, preserves information, and creates a versatile embedding space for conditioning the generative model. This technique can be applied to condition a network on any number, to provide fine control over generated microstructure images, thereby contributing to accelerated materials design",

Here, the idea is to reduce the variance of the low-sample CATE estimation by a (potentially constrained) low-dimensional representation. However, low-dimensional representations can lose information about the observed confounders and thus lead to bias, because of which the validity of representation learning for CATE estimation is typically violated. In this paper, we propose a new, representation-agnostic framework for estimating bounds on the representation-induced confounding bias that comes from dimensionality reduction (or other constraints on the representations) in CATE estimation. First, we establish theoretically under which conditions CATEs are non-identifiable given low-dimensional (constrained) representations. Second, as our remedy, we propose to perform partial identification of CATEs or, equivalently, aim at estimating of lower and upper bounds of the representation-induced confounding bias. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in a series of experiments. In sum, our framework is of direct relevance in practice where the validity of CATE estimation is of importance",

We explore a novel paradigm termed name-only continual learning where time and cost constraints prohibit manual annotation. In this scenario, learners adapt to new category shifts using only category names without the luxury of annotated training data. Our proposed solution leverages the expansive and ever-evolving internet to query and download uncurated webly-supervised data for image classification. We investigate the reliability of our web data and find them comparable, and in some cases superior, to manually annotated datasets. Additionally, we show that by harnessing the web, we can create support sets that surpass state-of-the-art name-only classification that create support sets using generative models or image retrieval from LAION-5B, achieving up to 25% boost in accuracy. When applied across varied continual learning contexts, our method consistently exhibits a small performance gap in comparison to models trained on manually annotated datasets. We present EvoTrends, a class-incremental dataset made from the web to capture real-world trends, created in just minutes.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Time series is a special type of sequence data, a sequence of real-valued random variables collected at even intervals of time. The real-world multivariate time series comes with noises and contains complicated local and global temporal dynamics, making it difficult to forecast the future time series given the historical observations. This work proposes a simple and effective framework, coined as TimeSQL, which leverages multi-scale patching and smooth quadratic loss (SQL) to tackle the above challenges. The multi-scale patching transforms the time series into two-dimensional patches with different length scales, facilitating the perception of both locality and long-term correlations in time series. SQL is derived from the rational quadratic kernel and can dynamically adjust the gradients to avoid overfitting to the noises and outliers. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, under mild conditions, the effect of the noises on the model with SQL is always smaller than that with MSE. Based on the two modules, TimeSQL achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the eight real-world benchmark datasets. Further ablation studies indicate that the key modules in TimeSQL could also enhance the results of other models for multivariate time series forecasting, standing as plug-and-play techniques",

The interplay between RRA and vehicle control necessitates their collaborative design. In this two-part paper (Part I and Part II), taking platoon control (PC) as an example use case, we propose a joint optimization framework of multi-timescale control and communications (MTCC) based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In this paper (Part I), we first decompose the problem into a communication-aware DRL-based PC sub-problem and a control-aware DRL-based RRA sub-problem. Then, we focus on the PC sub-problem assuming an RRA policy is given, and propose the MTCC-PC algorithm to learn an efficient PC policy. To improve the PC performance under random observation delay, the PC state space is augmented with the observation delay and PC action history. Moreover, the reward function with respect to the augmented state is defined to construct an augmented state Markov Decision Process (MDP). It is proved that the optimal policy for the augmented state MDP is optimal for the original PC problem with observation delay. Different from most existing works on communication-aware control, the MTCC-PC algorithm is trained in a delayed environment generated by the fine-grained embedded simulation of C-V2X communications rather than by a simple stochastic delay model. Finally, experiments are performed to compare the performance of MTCC-PC with those of the baseline DRL algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in scientific machine learning (SciML) becomes increasingly critical as neural networks (NNs) are being widely adopted in addressing complex problems across various scientific disciplines. Representative SciML models are physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs). While UQ in SciML has been increasingly investigated in recent years, very few works have focused on addressing the uncertainty caused by the noisy inputs, such as spatial-temporal coordinates in PINNs and input functions in NOs. The presence of noise in the inputs of the models can pose significantly more challenges compared to noise in the outputs of the models, primarily due to the inherent nonlinearity of most SciML algorithms. As a result, UQ for noisy inputs becomes a crucial factor for reliable and trustworthy deployment of these models in applications involving physical knowledge. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty arising from noisy inputs-outputs in PINNs and NOs. We show that this approach can be seamlessly integrated into PINNs and NOs, when they are employed to encode the physical information. PINNs incorporate physics by including physics-informed terms via automatic differentiation, either in the loss function or the likelihood, and often take as input the spatial-temporal coordinate. Therefore, the present method equips PINNs with the capability to address problems where the observed coordinate is subject to noise. On the other hand, pretrained NOs are also commonly employed as equation-free surrogates in solving differential equations and Bayesian inverse problems, in which they take functions as inputs. The proposed approach enables them to handle noisy measurements for both input and output functions with UQ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be an effective paradigm for the global optimization of expensive-to-sample systems. One of the main advantages of BO is its use of Gaussian processes (GPs) to characterize model uncertainty which can be leveraged to guide the learning and search process. However, BO typically treats systems as black-boxes and this limits the ability to exploit structural knowledge (e.g., physics and sparse interconnections). Composite functions of the form $f(x, y(x))$, wherein GP modeling is shifted from the performance function $f$ to an intermediate function $y$, offer an avenue for exploiting structural knowledge. However, the use of composite functions in a BO framework is complicated by the need to generate a probability density for $f$ from the Gaussian density of $y$ calculated by the GP (e.g., when $f$ is nonlinear it is not possible to obtain a closed-form expression). Previous work has handled this issue using sampling techniques; these are easy to implement and flexible but are computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce a new paradigm which allows for the efficient use of composite functions in BO; this uses adaptive linearizations of $f$ to obtain closed-form expressions for the statistical moments of the composite function. We show that this simple approach (which we call BOIS) enables the exploitation of structural knowledge, such as that arising in interconnected systems as well as systems that embed multiple GP models and combinations of physics and GP models. Using a chemical process optimization case study, we benchmark the effectiveness of BOIS against standard BO and sampling approaches.

By adding a small amount of labeled data of areas or regions where a U-Net model trained on OpenEarthMap clearly failed and retraining the model, an overall accuracy of 80\\% was achieved, which is a nearly 16 percentage point improvement after retraining. Using aerial imagery provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, we create land cover classification maps of eight classes for the entire country of Japan. Our framework, with its low annotation cost and high-accuracy mapping results, demonstrates the potential to contribute to the automatic updating of national-scale land cover mapping using submeter-level optical remote sensing data.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As IoT devices become widely, it is crucial to protect them from malicious intrusions. However, the data scarcity of IoT limits the applicability of traditional intrusion detection methods, which are highly data-dependent. To address this, in this paper we propose the Open-Set Dandelion Network (OSDN) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation in an open-set manner. The OSDN model performs intrusion knowledge transfer from the knowledge-rich source network intrusion domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for the data-scarce target IoT intrusion domain. Under the open-set setting, it can also detect newly-emerged target domain intrusions that are not observed in the source domain. To achieve this, the OSDN model forms the source domain into a dandelion-like feature space in which each intrusion category is compactly grouped and different intrusion categories are separated, i.e., simultaneously emphasising inter-category separability and intra-category compactness. The dandelion-based target membership mechanism then forms the target dandelion. Then, the dandelion angular separation mechanism achieves better inter-category separability, and the dandelion embedding alignment mechanism further aligns both dandelions in a finer manner. To promote intra-category compactness, the discriminating sampled dandelion mechanism is used. Assisted by the intrusion classifier trained using both known and generated unknown intrusion knowledge, a semantic dandelion correction mechanism emphasises easily-confused categories and guides better inter-category separability. Holistically, these mechanisms form the OSDN model that effectively performs intrusion knowledge transfer to benefit IoT intrusion detection. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets verify the effectiveness of the OSDN model, outperforming three state-of-the-art baseline methods by 16.9%",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The ongoing challenges in time series anomaly detection (TSAD), notably the scarcity of anomaly labels and the variability in anomaly lengths and shapes, have led to the need for a more efficient solution. As limited anomaly labels hinder traditional supervised models in TSAD, various SOTA deep learning techniques, such as self-supervised learning, have been introduced to tackle this issue. However, they encounter difficulties handling variations in anomaly lengths and shapes, limiting their adaptability to diverse anomalies. Additionally, many benchmark datasets suffer from the problem of having explicit anomalies that even random functions can detect. This problem is exacerbated by ill-posed evaluation metrics, known as point adjustment (PA), which can result in inflated model performance. In this context, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based Tri-domain Anomaly Detector (TriAD), which addresses these challenges by modeling features across three data domains - temporal, frequency, and residual domains - without relying on anomaly labels. Unlike traditional contrastive learning methods, TriAD employs both inter-domain and intra-domain contrastive loss to learn common attributes among normal data and differentiate them from anomalies. Additionally, our approach can detect anomalies of varying lengths by integrating with a discord discovery algorithm. It is worth noting that this study is the first to reevaluate the deep learning potential in TSAD, utilizing both rigorously designed datasets (i.e., UCR Archive) and evaluation metrics (i.e., PA%K and affiliation). Through experimental results on the UCR dataset, TriAD achieves an impressive three-fold increase in PA%K based F1 scores over SOTA deep learning models, and 50% increase of accuracy as compared to SOTA discord discovery algorithms",

In response to this challenge, we propose a novel federated tuning algorithm, FedRA. The implementation of FedRA is straightforward and can be seamlessly integrated into any transformer-based model without the need for further modification to the original model. Specifically, in each communication round, FedRA randomly generates an allocation matrix. For resource-constrained clients, it reorganizes a small number of layers from the original model based on the allocation matrix and fine-tunes using LoRA. Subsequently, the server aggregates the updated LoRA parameters from the clients according to the current allocation matrix into the corresponding layers of the original model. It is worth noting that FedRA also supports scenarios where none of the clients can support the entire global model, which is an impressive advantage. We conduct experiments on two large-scale image datasets, DomainNet and NICO++, under various non-iid settings. The results demonstrate that FedRA outperforms the compared methods significantly.

    "title": "TextGuard: Provable Defense against Backdoor Attacks on Text Classification",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have become a major security threat for deploying machine learning models in security-critical applications. Existing research endeavors have proposed many defenses against backdoor attacks. Despite demonstrating certain empirical defense efficacy, none of these techniques could provide a formal and provable security guarantee against arbitrary attacks. As a result, they can be easily broken by strong adaptive attacks, as shown in our evaluation. In this work, we propose TextGuard, the first provable defense against backdoor attacks on text classification. In particular, TextGuard first divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger. Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the triggers in training and testing inputs. In our evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TextGuard on three benchmark text classification tasks, surpassing the certification accuracy of existing certified defenses against backdoor attacks. Furthermore, we propose additional strategies to enhance the empirical performance of TextGuard. Comparisons with state-of-the-art empirical defenses validate the superiority of TextGuard in countering multiple backdoor attacks.

    "title": "Can We Utilize Pre-trained Language Models within Causal Discovery Algorithms?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Scaling laws have allowed Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) into the field of causal reasoning. Causal reasoning of PLM relies solely on text-based descriptions, in contrast to causal discovery which aims to determine the causal relationships between variables utilizing data. Recently, there has been current research regarding a method that mimics causal discovery by aggregating the outcomes of repetitive causal reasoning, achieved through specifically designed prompts. It highlights the usefulness of PLMs in discovering cause and effect, which is often limited by a lack of data, especially when dealing with multiple variables. Conversely, the characteristics of PLMs which are that PLMs do not analyze data and they are highly dependent on prompt design leads to a crucial limitation for directly using PLMs in causal discovery. Accordingly, PLM-based causal reasoning deeply depends on the prompt design and carries out the risk of overconfidence and false predictions in determining causal relationships. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate the aforementioned limitations of PLM-based causal reasoning through experiments on physics-inspired synthetic data. Then, we propose a new framework that integrates prior knowledge obtained from PLM with a causal discovery algorithm. This is accomplished by initializing an adjacency matrix for causal discovery and incorporating regularization using prior knowledge. Our proposed framework not only demonstrates improved performance through the integration of PLM and causal discovery but also suggests how to leverage PLM-extracted prior knowledge with existing causal discovery algorithms",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) framework for network slicing in a dynamic environment with multiple base stations and multiple users. In particular, we propose a novel deep RL framework with multiple actors and centralized critic (MACC) in which actors are implemented as pointer networks to fit the varying dimension of input. We evaluate the performance of the proposed deep RL algorithm via simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness. Subsequently, we develop a deep RL based jammer with limited prior information and limited power budget. The goal of the jammer is to minimize the transmission rates achieved with network slicing and thus degrade the network slicing agents' performance. We design a jammer with both listening and jamming phases and address jamming location optimization as well as jamming channel optimization via deep RL. We evaluate the jammer at the optimized location, generating interference attacks in the optimized set of channels by switching between the jamming phase and listening phase. We show that the proposed jammer can significantly reduce the victims' performance without direct feedback or prior knowledge on the network slicing policies. Finally, we devise a Nash-equilibrium-supervised policy ensemble mixed strategy profile for network slicing (as a defensive measure) and jamming. We evaluate the performance of the proposed policy ensemble algorithm by applying on the network slicing agents and the jammer agent in simulations to show its effectiveness",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The power-law distribution plays a crucial role in complex networks as well as various applied sciences. Investigating whether the degree distribution of a network follows a power-law distribution is an important concern. The commonly used inferential methods for estimating the model parameters often yield biased estimates, which can lead to the rejection of the hypothesis that a model conforms to a power-law. In this paper, we discuss improved methods that utilize Bayesian inference to obtain accurate estimates and precise credibility intervals. The inferential methods are derived for both continuous and discrete distributions. These methods reveal that objective Bayesian approaches return nearly unbiased estimates for the parameters of both models. Notably, in the continuous case, we identify an explicit posterior distribution. This work enhances the power of goodness-of-fit tests, enabling us to accurately discern whether a network or any other dataset adheres to a power-law distribution. We apply the proposed approach to fit degree distributions for more than 5,000 synthetic networks and over 3,000 real networks. The results indicate that our method is more suitable in practice, as it yields a frequency of acceptance close to the specified nominal level",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The process of annotating relevant data in the field of digital microscopy can be both time-consuming and especially expensive due to the required technical skills and human-expert knowledge. Consequently, large amounts of microscopic image data sets remain unlabeled, preventing their effective exploitation using deep-learning algorithms. In recent years it has been shown that a lot of relevant information can be drawn from unlabeled data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising solution based on learning intrinsic features under a pretext task that is similar to the main task without requiring labels. The trained result is transferred to the main task - image segmentation in our case. A ResNet50 U-Net was first trained to restore images of liver progenitor organoids from augmented images using the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM), alone, and using SSIM combined with L1 loss. Both the encoder and decoder were trained in tandem. The weights were transferred to another U-Net model designed for segmentation with frozen encoder weights, using Binary Cross Entropy, Dice, and Intersection over Union (IoU) losses. For comparison, we used the same U-Net architecture to train two supervised models, one utilizing the ResNet50 encoder as well as a simple CNN. Results showed that self-supervised learning models using a 25\\% pixel drop or image blurring augmentation performed better than the other augmentation techniques using the IoU loss. When trained on only 114 images for the main task, the self-supervised learning approach outperforms the supervised method achieving an F1-score of 0.85, with higher stability, in contrast to an F1=0.78 scored by the supervised method. Furthermore, when trained with larger data sets (1,000 images), self-supervised learning is still able to perform better, achieving an F1-score of 0.92, contrasting to a score of 0.85 for the supervised method",

Specifically, we consider the following distributional property testing framework: Suppose there is a set of distributions over a discrete support of size $k$, $\\textbf{p}_1, \\textbf{p}_2,\\ldots,\\textbf{p}_T$, and we obtain $c$ independent draws from each distribution. Suppose the goal is to learn or test a property of the average distribution, $\\textbf{p}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$. This setup models a number of important practical settings where the individual distributions correspond to heterogeneous entities -- either individuals, chronologically distinct time periods, spatially separated data sources, etc. From a learning standpoint, even with $c=1$ samples from each distribution, $\\Theta(k/\\varepsilon^2)$ samples are necessary and sufficient to learn $\\textbf{p}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ to within error $\\varepsilon$ in TV distance. To test uniformity or identity -- distinguishing the case that $\\textbf{p}_{\\mathrm{avg}}$ is equal to some reference distribution, versus has $\\ell_1$ distance at least $\\varepsilon$ from the reference distribution, we show that a linear number of samples in $k$ is necessary given $c=1$ samples from each distribution. In contrast, for $c \\ge 2$, we recover the usual sublinear sample testing of the i.i.d. setting: we show that $O(\\sqrt{k}/\\varepsilon^2 + 1/\\varepsilon^4)$ samples are sufficient, matching the optimal sample complexity in the i.i.d. case in the regime where $\\varepsilon \\ge k^{-1/4}$. Additionally, we show that in the $c=2$ case, there is a constant $\\rho > 0$ such that even in the linear regime with $\\rho k$ samples, no tester that considers the multiset of samples (ignoring which samples were drawn from the same $\\textbf{p}_i$) can perform uniformity testing",

We develop mathematical programming models that define explicitly both types of auctions, and show that in each type, there are significant benefits to be gained both on the side of the hotelier as well as on the side of the customer. We discuss algorithmic techniques for the approximate solution of these optimization problems, and present results using exact optimization solvers to solve them to guaranteed optimality.

However, real-world complex systems present three prevalent challenges concerning task planning and tool usage: (1) The real system usually has a vast array of APIs, so it is impossible to feed the descriptions of all APIs to the prompt of LLMs as the token length is limited; (2) the real system is designed for handling complex tasks, and the base LLMs can hardly plan a correct sub-task order and API-calling order for such tasks; (3) Similar semantics and functionalities among APIs in real systems create challenges for both LLMs and even humans in distinguishing between them. In response, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework aimed at enhancing the Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities of LLM-based agents operating within real-world systems. Our framework comprises three key components designed to address these challenges: (1) the API Retriever selects the most pertinent APIs for the user task among the extensive array available; (2) LLM Finetuner tunes a base LLM so that the finetuned LLM can be more capable for task planning and API calling; (3) the Demo Selector adaptively retrieves different demonstrations related to hard-to-distinguish APIs, which is further used for in-context learning to boost the final performance.

However, control-based approaches are not suitable due to the difficulty of formally describing open-world manipulation in reality, and the inefficiency of existing learning methods. Thus, applying manipulation in a wide range of scenarios presents significant challenges. In this study, we propose a novel method for skill learning in robotic manipulation called Tactile Active Inference Reinforcement Learning (Tactile-AIRL), aimed at achieving efficient training. To enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL), we introduce active inference, which integrates model-based techniques and intrinsic curiosity into the RL process. This integration improves the algorithm's training efficiency and adaptability to sparse rewards. Additionally, we utilize a vision-based tactile sensor to provide detailed perception for manipulation tasks. Finally, we employ a model-based approach to imagine and plan appropriate actions through free energy minimization. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly high training efficiency in non-prehensile objects pushing tasks. It enables agents to excel in both dense and sparse reward tasks with just a few interaction episodes, surpassing the SAC baseline.

We demonstrate that AdvPT improves resistance against white-box and black-box adversarial attacks and exhibits a synergistic effect when combined with existing image-processing-based defense techniques, further boosting defensive capabilities. Comprehensive experimental analyses provide insights into adversarial prompt tuning, a novel paradigm devoted to improving resistance to adversarial images through textual input modifications, paving the way for future robust multimodal learning research. These findings open up new possibilities for enhancing the security of VLMs. Our code will be available upon publication of the paper",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As technological advancements in extended reality (XR) amplify the demand for more XR content, traditional development processes face several challenges: 1) a steep learning curve for inexperienced developers, 2) a disconnect between 2D development environments and 3D user experiences inside headsets, and 3) slow iteration cycles due to context switching between development and testing environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AtomXR, a streamlined, immersive, no-code XR prototyping tool designed to empower both experienced and inexperienced developers in creating applications using natural language, eye-gaze, and touch interactions. AtomXR consists of: 1) AtomScript, a high-level human-interpretable scripting language for rapid prototyping, 2) a natural language interface that integrates LLMs and multimodal inputs for AtomScript generation, and 3) an immersive in-headset authoring environment. Empirical evaluation through two user studies offers insights into natural language-based and immersive prototyping, and shows AtomXR provides significant improvements in speed and user experience compared to traditional systems",

    "abstract": "A multi-modal emotion recognition method was established by combining two-channel convolutional neural network with ring network. This method can extract emotional information effectively and improve learning efficiency. The words were vectorized with GloVe, and the word vector was input into the convolutional neural network. Combining attention mechanism and maximum pool converter BiSRU channel, the local deep emotion and pre-post sequential emotion semantics are obtained. Finally, multiple features are fused and input as the polarity of emotion, so as to achieve the emotion analysis of the target. Experiments show that the emotion analysis method based on feature fusion can effectively improve the recognition accuracy of emotion data set and reduce the learning time.

    "title": "An Interactive Query Generation Assistant using LLM-based Prompt Modification and User Feedback",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While search is the predominant method of accessing information, formulating effective queries remains a challenging task, especially for situations where the users are not familiar with a domain, or searching for documents in other languages, or looking for complex information such as events, which are not easily expressible as queries. Providing example documents or passages of interest, might be easier for a user, however, such query-by-example scenarios are prone to concept drift, and are highly sensitive to the query generation method. This demo illustrates complementary approaches of using LLMs interactively, assisting and enabling the user to provide edits and feedback at all stages of the query formulation process. The proposed Query Generation Assistant is a novel search interface which supports automatic and interactive query generation over a mono-linguial or multi-lingual document collection. Specifically, the proposed assistive interface enables the users to refine the queries generated by different LLMs, to provide feedback on the retrieved documents or passages, and is able to incorporate the users' feedback as prompts to generate more effective queries. The proposed interface is a valuable experimental tool for exploring fine-tuning and prompting of LLMs for query generation to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of retrieval and ranking models, and for conducting Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) experiments for complex search tasks where users struggle to formulate queries without such assistance",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Effective cyber threat recognition and prevention demand comprehensible forecasting systems, as prior approaches commonly offer limited and, ultimately, unconvincing information. We introduce Simplified Plaintext Language (SPLAIN), a natural language generator that converts warning data into user-friendly cyber threat explanations. SPLAIN is designed to generate clear, actionable outputs, incorporating hierarchically organized explanatory details about input data and system functionality. Given the inputs of individual sensor-induced forecasting signals and an overall warning from a fusion module, SPLAIN queries each signal for information on contributing sensors and data signals. This collected data is processed into a coherent English explanation, encompassing forecasting, sensing, and data elements for user review. SPLAIN's template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary. SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand. Our conclusions emphasize the need for designers to specify the \"how\" and \"why\" behind cyber warnings, advocate for simple structured templates in generating consistent explanations, and recognize that direct causal links in Machine Learning approaches may not always be identifiable, requiring some explanations to focus on general methodologies, such as model and training data",

    "title": "On the Noise Scheduling for Generating Plausible Designs with Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep Generative Models (DGMs) are widely used to create innovative designs across multiple industries, ranging from fashion to the automotive sector. In addition to generating images of high visual quality, the task of structural design generation imposes more stringent constrains on the semantic expression, e.g., no floating material or missing part, which we refer to as plausibility in this work. We delve into the impact of noise schedules of diffusion models on the plausibility of the outcome: there exists a range of noise levels at which the model's performance decides the result plausibility. Also, we propose two techniques to determine such a range for a given image set and devise a novel parametric noise schedule for better plausibility. We apply this noise schedule to the training and sampling of the well-known diffusion model EDM and compare it to its default noise schedule. Compared to EDM, our schedule significantly improves the rate of plausible designs from 83.4% to 93.5% and Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID) from 7.84 to 4.87. Further applications of advanced image editing tools demonstrate the model's solid understanding of structure",

    "title": "Assessing AI Impact Assessments: A Classroom Study",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessments (\"AIIAs\"), a family of tools that provide structured processes to imagine the possible impacts of a proposed AI system, have become an increasingly popular proposal to govern AI systems. Recent efforts from government or private-sector organizations have proposed many diverse instantiations of AIIAs, which take a variety of forms ranging from open-ended questionnaires to graded score-cards. However, to date that has been limited evaluation of existing AIIA instruments. We conduct a classroom study (N = 38) at a large research-intensive university (R1) in an elective course focused on the societal and ethical implications of AI. We assign students to different organizational roles (for example, an ML scientist or product manager) and ask participant teams to complete one of three existing AI impact assessments for one of two imagined generative AI systems. In our thematic analysis of participants' responses to pre- and post-activity questionnaires, we find preliminary evidence that impact assessments can influence participants' perceptions of the potential risks of generative AI systems, and the level of responsibility held by AI experts in addressing potential harm. We also discover a consistent set of limitations shared by several existing AIIA instruments, which we group into concerns about their format and content, as well as the feasibility and effectiveness of the activity in foreseeing and mitigating potential harms. Drawing on the findings of this study, we provide recommendations for future work on developing and validating AIIAs",

    "title": "Attention-Based Real-Time Defenses for Physical Adversarial Attacks in Vision Applications",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks exhibit excellent performance in computer vision tasks, but their vulnerability to real-world adversarial attacks, achieved through physical objects that can corrupt their predictions, raises serious security concerns for their application in safety-critical domains. Existing defense methods focus on single-frame analysis and are characterized by high computational costs that limit their applicability in multi-frame scenarios, where real-time decisions are crucial. To address this problem, this paper proposes an efficient attention-based defense mechanism that exploits adversarial channel-attention to quickly identify and track malicious objects in shallow network layers and mask their adversarial effects in a multi-frame setting. This work advances the state of the art by enhancing existing over-activation techniques for real-world adversarial attacks to make them usable in real-time applications. It also introduces an efficient multi-frame defense framework, validating its efficacy through extensive experiments aimed at evaluating both defense performance and computational cost",

By making the LLM the task planner and off-the-shelf vision models the tools, the proposed method is capable of classifying and segmenting target objects using only image-level labels. Specifically, chain-of-thought prompting and in-context learning guide the LLM to observe support images like human; vision models such as Segment Anything Model (SAM) and GPT-4Vision assist LLM understand spatial and semantic information at the same time. Ultimately, the LLM uses its summarizing and reasoning capabilities to classify and segment the query image. The proposed method's modular framework makes it easily extendable.
