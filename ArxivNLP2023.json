    "title": "Making Large Multimodal Models Understand Arbitrary Visual Prompts",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "While existing large vision-language multimodal models focus on whole image understanding, there is a prominent gap in achieving region-specific comprehension. Current approaches that use textual coordinates or spatial encodings often fail to provide a user-friendly interface for visual prompting. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multimodal model capable of decoding arbitrary visual prompts. This allows users to intuitively mark images and interact with the model using natural cues like a \"red bounding box\" or \"pointed arrow\". Our simple design directly overlays visual markers onto the RGB image, eliminating the need for complex region encodings, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on region-understanding tasks like Visual7W, PointQA, and Visual Commonsense Reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, we present ViP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to assess the capability of models in understanding visual prompts across multiple dimensions, enabling future research in this domain. Code, data, and model are publicly available",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Conversational agents leveraging AI, particularly deep learning, are emerging in both academic research and real-world applications. However, these applications still face challenges, including disrespecting knowledge and facts, not personalizing to user preferences, and enormous demand for computational resources during training and inference. Recent research efforts have been focused on addressing these challenges from various aspects, including supplementing various types of auxiliary information to the conversational agents. However, existing methods are still not able to effectively and efficiently exploit relevant information from these auxiliary supplements to further unleash the power of the conversational agents and the language models they use. In this paper, we present a novel method, PK-NCLI, that is able to accurately and efficiently identify relevant auxiliary information to improve the quality of conversational responses by learning the relevance among persona, chat history, and knowledge background through low-level normalized contextual latent interaction. Our experimental results indicate that PK-NCLI outperforms the state-of-the-art method, PK-FoCus, by 47.80%/30.61%/24.14% in terms of perplexity, knowledge grounding, and training efficiency, respectively, and maintained the same level of persona grounding performance. We also provide a detailed analysis of how different factors, including language model choices and trade-offs on training weights, would affect the performance of PK-NCLI",

    "title": "Beyond ChatBots: ExploreLLM for Structured Thoughts and Personalized Model Responses",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) powered chatbots are primarily text-based today, and impose a large interactional cognitive load, especially for exploratory or sensemaking tasks such as planning a trip or learning about a new city. Because the interaction is textual, users have little scaffolding in the way of structure, informational \"scent\", or ability to specify high-level preferences or goals. We introduce ExploreLLM that allows users to structure thoughts, help explore different options, navigate through the choices and recommendations, and to more easily steer models to generate more personalized responses. We conduct a user study and show that users find it helpful to use ExploreLLM for exploratory or planning tasks, because it provides a useful schema-like structure to the task, and guides users in planning. The study also suggests that users can more easily personalize responses with high-level preferences with ExploreLLM. Together, ExploreLLM points to a future where users interact with LLMs beyond the form of chatbots, and instead designed to support complex user tasks with a tighter integration between natural language and graphical user interfaces",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Transformers have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of natural language processing and computer vision applications. However, the representation capacity of a deep transformer model is degraded due to the over-smoothing issue in which the token representations become identical when the model's depth grows. In this work, we show that self-attention layers in transformers minimize a functional which promotes smoothness, thereby causing token uniformity. We then propose a novel regularizer that penalizes the norm of the difference between the smooth output tokens from self-attention and the input tokens to preserve the fidelity of the tokens. Minimizing the resulting regularized energy functional, we derive the Neural Transformer with a Regularized Nonlocal Functional (NeuTRENO), a novel class of transformer models that can mitigate the over-smoothing issue. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of NeuTRENO over the baseline transformers and state-of-the-art methods in reducing the over-smoothing of token representations on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various tasks, there remains a linguistic bias that favors high-resource languages, such as English, often at the expense of low-resource and regional languages. To address this imbalance, we introduce SeaLLMs, an innovative series of language models that specifically focuses on Southeast Asian (SEA) languages. SeaLLMs are built upon the Llama-2 model and further advanced through continued pre-training with an extended vocabulary, specialized instruction and alignment tuning to better capture the intricacies of regional languages. This allows them to respect and reflect local cultural norms, customs, stylistic preferences, and legal considerations. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SeaLLM-13b models exhibit superior performance across a wide spectrum of linguistic tasks and assistant-style instruction-following capabilities relative to comparable open-source models. Moreover, they outperform ChatGPT-3.5 in non-Latin languages, such as Thai, Khmer, Lao, and Burmese, by large margins while remaining lightweight and cost-effective to operate",

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Guided by grammatical structure, words compose to form sentences, and guided by discourse structure, sentences compose to form dialogues and documents. The compositional aspect of sentence and discourse units is often overlooked by machine learning algorithms. A recent initiative called Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) learns word meanings as points in a Hilbert space and acts on them via a translation of grammatical structure into Parametrised Quantum Circuits (PQCs). Previous work extended the QNLP translation to discourse structure using points in a closure of Hilbert spaces. In this paper, we evaluate this translation on a Winograd-style pronoun resolution task. We train a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) for binary classification and implement an end-to-end pronoun resolution system. The simulations executed on IBMQ software converged with an F1 score of 87.20%. The model outperformed two out of three classical coreference resolution systems and neared state-of-the-art SpanBERT. A mixed quantum-classical model yet improved these results with an F1 score increase of around 6%",

Although their application to numerous natural language processing tasks has proven to be very fruitful, they continue to be models with little or no interpretability and explainability. One of the tasks for which they are best suited is the encoding of the contextual sense of words using contextualized embeddings. In this paper we propose a transparent, interpretable, and linguistically motivated strategy for encoding the contextual sense of words by modeling semantic compositionality. Particular attention is given to dependency relations and semantic notions such as selection preferences and paradigmatic classes. A partial implementation of the proposed model is carried out and compared with Transformer-based architectures for a given semantic task, namely the similarity calculation of word senses in context. The results obtained show that it is possible to be competitive with linguistically motivated models instead of using the black boxes underlying complex neural architectures",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been a driving force in transforming various domains, reshaping the artificial general intelligence landscape. However, the increasing computational and memory demands of these models present substantial challenges, hindering both academic research and practical applications. To address these issues, a wide array of methods, including both algorithmic and hardware solutions, have been developed to enhance the efficiency of LLMs. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of algorithmic advancements aimed at improving LLM efficiency. Unlike other surveys that typically focus on specific areas such as training or model compression, this paper examines the multi-faceted dimensions of efficiency essential for the end-to-end algorithmic development of LLMs. Specifically, it covers various topics related to efficiency, including scaling laws, data utilization, architectural innovations, training and tuning strategies, and inference techniques. This paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, laying the groundwork for future innovations in this critical research area.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "The current paradigm of large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning Transformer large language models has lead to significant improvements across the board in natural language processing. However, such large models are susceptible to overfitting to their training data, and as a result the models perform poorly when the domain changes. Also, due to the model's scale, the cost of fine-tuning the model to the new domain is large. Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) has been proposed as a regulariser for training cross-attention in Transformers, potentially addressing the overfitting problem. We extend the NVIB framework to replace all types of attention functions in Transformers, and show that existing pretrained Transformers can be reinterpreted as Nonparametric Variational (NV) models using a proposed identity initialisation. We then show that changing the initialisation introduces a novel, information-theoretic post-training regularisation in the attention mechanism, which improves out-of-domain generalisation without any training. This success supports the hypothesis that pretrained Transformers are implicitly NV Bayesian models",

    "abstract": "The introduction of large public legal datasets has brought about a renaissance in legal NLP. Many of these datasets are comprised of legal judgements - the product of judges deciding cases. This fact, together with the way machine learning works, means that several legal NLP models are models of judges. While some have argued for the automation of judges, in this position piece, we argue that automating the role of the judge raises difficult ethical challenges, in particular for common law legal systems. Our argument follows from the social role of the judge in actively shaping the law, rather than merely applying it. Since current NLP models come nowhere close to having the facilities necessary for this task, they should not be used to automate judges. Furthermore, even in the case the models could achieve human-level capabilities, there would still be remaining ethical concerns inherent in the automation of the legal process",

    "abstract": "Instruction-tuning is a widely adopted method of finetuning that enables large language models (LLMs) to generate output that more closely resembles human responses to natural language queries, in many cases leading to human-level performance on diverse testbeds. However, it remains unclear whether instruction-tuning truly makes LLMs more similar to how humans process language. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on LLM-human similarity in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs across three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences. We discover that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment by an average of 6%, but does not have a similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify the factors underlying LLM-brain alignment, we compute correlations between the brain alignment of LLMs and various model properties, such as model size, various problem-solving abilities, and performance on tasks requiring world knowledge spanning various domains. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain",

    "title": "Explanatory Argument Extraction of Correct Answers in Resident Medical Exams",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Developing the required technology to assist medical experts in their everyday activities is currently a hot topic in the Artificial Intelligence research field. Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) and automated benchmarks have recently been proposed with the aim of facilitating information extraction in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) using natural language as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. The most representative benchmarks are limited to either multiple-choice or long-form answers and are available only in English. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present a new dataset which, unlike previous work: (i) includes not only explanatory arguments for the correct answer, but also arguments to reason why the incorrect answers are not correct; (ii) the explanations are written originally by medical doctors to answer questions from the Spanish Residency Medical Exams. Furthermore, this new benchmark allows us to setup a novel extractive task which consists of identifying the explanation of the correct answer written by medical doctors. An additional benefit of our setting is that we can leverage the extractive QA paradigm to automatically evaluate performance of LLMs without resorting to costly manual evaluation by medical experts. Comprehensive experimentation with language models for Spanish shows that sometimes multilingual models fare better than monolingual ones, even outperforming models which have been adapted to the medical domain. Furthermore, results across the monolingual models are mixed, with supposedly smaller and inferior models performing competitively. In any case, the obtained results show that our novel dataset and approach can be an effective technique to help medical practitioners in identifying relevant evidence-based explanations for medical questions",

    "abstract": "Programming language understanding and representation (a.k.a code representation learning) has always been a hot and challenging task in software engineering. It aims to apply deep learning techniques to produce numerical representations of the source code features while preserving its semantics. These representations can be used for facilitating subsequent code-related tasks. The abstract syntax tree (AST), a fundamental code feature, illustrates the syntactic information of the source code and has been widely used in code representation learning. However, there is still a lack of systematic and quantitative evaluation of how well AST-based code representation facilitates subsequent code-related tasks. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of the AST-based code representation in facilitating follow-up code-related tasks. To do so, we compare the performance of models trained with code token sequence (Token for short) based code representation and AST-based code representation on three popular types of code-related tasks. Surprisingly, the overall quantitative statistical results demonstrate that models trained with AST-based code representation consistently perform worse across all three tasks compared to models trained with Token-based code representation. Our further quantitative analysis reveals that models trained with AST-based code representation outperform models trained with Token-based code representation in certain subsets of samples across all three tasks. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate and reveal the impact of the choice of AST parsing/preprocessing/encoding methods on AST-based code representation and subsequent code-related tasks.

Access to pre-trained models, courtesy of the open-source community, has made it possible to adapt these models to specific applications for enhanced performance. However, the substantial resources required for training these models necessitate efficient solutions. This paper introduces CoLLiE, an efficient library that facilitates collaborative training of large language models using 3D parallelism, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and optimizers such as Lion, Adan, Sophia, LOMO and AdaLomo. With its modular design and comprehensive functionality, CoLLiE offers a balanced blend of efficiency, ease of use, and customization. CoLLiE has proven superior training efficiency in comparison with prevalent solutions in pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios.

    "title": "Event-driven Real-time Retrieval in Web Search",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Information retrieval in real-time search presents unique challenges distinct from those encountered in classical web search. These challenges are particularly pronounced due to the rapid change of user search intent, which is influenced by the occurrence and evolution of breaking news events, such as earthquakes, elections, and wars. Previous dense retrieval methods, which primarily focused on static semantic representation, lack the capacity to capture immediate search intent, leading to inferior performance in retrieving the most recent event-related documents in time-sensitive scenarios. To address this issue, this paper expands the query with event information that represents real-time search intent. The Event information is then integrated with the query through a cross-attention mechanism, resulting in a time-context query representation. We further enhance the model's capacity for event representation through multi-task training. Since publicly available datasets such as MS-MARCO do not contain any event information on the query side and have few time-sensitive queries, we design an automatic data collection and annotation pipeline to address this issue, which includes ModelZoo-based Coarse Annotation and LLM-driven Fine Annotation processes. In addition, we share the training tricks such as two-stage training and hard negative sampling. Finally, we conduct a set of offline experiments on a million-scale production dataset to evaluate our approach and deploy an A/B testing in a real online system to verify the performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods",

Two research questions are formulated to investigate the accuracy of LLMs in recalling information from pre-training knowledge graphs and their ability to infer knowledge graph relations from context. To address these questions, we employ LLMs to perform four distinct knowledge graph reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we identify two types of hallucinations that may occur during knowledge reasoning with LLMs: content and ontology hallucination. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can successfully tackle both simple and complex knowledge graph reasoning tasks from their own memory, as well as infer from input context",

The idea is to collect data in tightly scoped, carefully defined ways which allow for exhaustive annotation of behavioral phenomena of interest, and then use machine learning to construct explanatory theories of these phenomena which can form building blocks for intelligible AI systems. After laying some conceptual groundwork, I describe several investigations into data-driven theories of shallow semantic structure using Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL), a schema for annotating verbal predicate-argument relations using highly constrained question-answer pairs.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video-language understanding have been established on the foundation of image-text models, resulting in promising outcomes due to the shared knowledge between images and videos. However, video-language understanding presents unique challenges due to the inclusion of highly complex semantic details, which result in information redundancy, temporal dependency, and scene complexity. Current techniques have only partially tackled these issues, and our quantitative analysis indicates that some of these methods are complementary. In light of this, we propose a novel framework called RTQ (Refine, Temporal model, and Query), which addresses these challenges simultaneously. The approach involves refining redundant information within frames, modeling temporal relations among frames, and querying task-specific information from the videos. Remarkably, our model demonstrates outstanding performance even in the absence of video-language pre-training, and the results are comparable with or superior to those achieved by state-of-the-art pre-training methods",

    "abstract": "Ontology matching (OM) enables semantic interoperability between different ontologies and resolves their conceptual heterogeneity by aligning related entities. OM systems currently have two prevailing design paradigms: conventional knowledge-based expert systems and newer machine learning-based predictive systems. While large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have become revolutionary in data engineering and have been applied creatively in various domains, their potential for OM remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel agent-powered LLM-based design paradigm for OM systems. With thoughtful consideration of several specific challenges to leverage LLMs for OM, we propose a generic framework, namely Agent-OM, consisting of two Siamese agents for retrieval and matching, with a set of simple prompt-based OM tools. Our framework is implemented in a proof-of-concept system. Evaluations of three Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) tracks over state-of-the-art OM systems show that our system can achieve very close results to the best long-standing performance on simple OM tasks and significantly improve the performance on complex and few-shot OM tasks",

This paper adapts different psychological models in the proposed PsyAttention for personality detection, which can effectively encode psychological features, reducing their number by 85%.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Deception is the intentional practice of twisting information. It is a nuanced societal practice deeply intertwined with human societal evolution, characterized by a multitude of facets. This research explores the problem of deception through the lens of psychology, employing a framework that categorizes deception into three forms: lies of omission, lies of commission, and lies of influence. The primary focus of this study is specifically on investigating only lies of omission. We propose a novel framework for deception detection leveraging NLP techniques. We curated an annotated dataset of 876,784 samples by amalgamating a popular large-scale fake news dataset and scraped news headlines from the Twitter handle of Times of India, a well-known Indian news media house. Each sample has been labeled with four layers, namely: (i) the type of omission (speculation, bias, distortion, sounds factual, and opinion), (ii) colors of lies(black, white, etc), and (iii) the intention of such lies (to influence, etc) (iv) topic of lies (political, educational, religious, etc). We present a novel multi-task learning pipeline that leverages the dataless merging of fine-tuned language models to address the deception detection task mentioned earlier. Our proposed model achieved an F1 score of 0.87, demonstrating strong performance across all layers including the type, color, intent, and topic aspects of deceptive content. Finally, our research explores the relationship between lies of omission and propaganda techniques. To accomplish this, we conducted an in-depth analysis, uncovering compelling findings. For instance, our analysis revealed a significant correlation between loaded language and opinion, shedding light on their interconnectedness. To encourage further research in this field, we will be making the models and dataset available with the MIT License, making it favorable for open-source research",

    "title": "Text Attribute Control via Closed-Loop Disentanglement",
    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Changing an attribute of a text without changing the content usually requires to first disentangle the text into irrelevant attributes and content representations. After that, in the inference phase, the representation of one attribute is tuned to a different value, expecting that the corresponding attribute of the text can also be changed accordingly. The usual way of disentanglement is to add some constraints on the latent space of an encoder-decoder architecture, including adversarial-based constraints and mutual-information-based constraints. However, the previous semi-supervised processes of attribute change are usually not enough to guarantee the success of attribute change and content preservation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieve a robust control of attributes while enhancing content preservation. In this approach, we use a semi-supervised contrastive learning method to encourage the disentanglement of attributes in latent spaces. Differently from previous works, we re-disentangle the reconstructed sentence and compare the re-disentangled latent space with the original latent space, which makes a closed-loop disentanglement process. This also helps content preservation. In addition, the contrastive learning method is also able to replace the role of minimizing mutual information and adversarial training in the disentanglement process, which alleviates the computation cost. We conducted experiments on three text datasets, including the Yelp Service review dataset, the Amazon Product review dataset, and the GoEmotions dataset.

In this context, the ability to distinguish machine-generated text from human-authored content becomes important. Prior works have proposed numerous schemes to watermark text, which would benefit from a systematic evaluation framework. This work focuses on text watermarking techniques - as opposed to image watermarks - and proposes a comprehensive benchmark for them under different tasks as well as practical attacks. We focus on three main metrics: quality, size (e.g. the number of tokens needed to detect a watermark), and tamper-resistance. Current watermarking techniques are good enough to be deployed: Kirchenbauer et al. can watermark Llama2-7B-chat with no perceivable loss in quality in under 100 tokens, and with good tamper-resistance to simple attacks, regardless of temperature. We argue that watermark indistinguishability is too strong a requirement: schemes that slightly modify logit distributions outperform their indistinguishable counterparts with no noticeable loss in generation quality.

Given the recent surge in multi-modal, relying solely on a single modality is arguably insufficient.

In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal video topic segmenter that utilizes both video transcripts and frames, bolstered by a cross-modal attention mechanism. Furthermore, we propose a dual-contrastive learning framework adhering to the unsupervised domain adaptation paradigm, enhancing our model's adaptability to longer, more semantically complex videos.

    "title": "Robust Concept Erasure via Kernelized Rate-Distortion Maximization",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Distributed representations provide a vector space that captures meaningful relationships between data instances. The distributed nature of these representations, however, entangles together multiple attributes or concepts of data instances (e.g., the topic or sentiment of a text, characteristics of the author (age, gender, etc), etc). Recent work has proposed the task of concept erasure, in which rather than making a concept predictable, the goal is to remove an attribute from distributed representations while retaining other information from the original representation space as much as possible. In this paper, we propose a new distance metric learning-based objective, the Kernelized Rate-Distortion Maximizer (KRaM), for performing concept erasure. KRaM fits a transformation of representations to match a specified distance measure (defined by a labeled concept to erase) using a modified rate-distortion function. Specifically, KRaM's objective function aims to make instances with similar concept labels dissimilar in the learned representation space while retaining other information. We find that optimizing KRaM effectively erases various types of concepts: categorical, continuous, and vector-valued variables from data representations across diverse domains. We also provide a theoretical analysis of several properties of KRaM's objective. To assess the quality of the learned representations, we propose an alignment score to evaluate their similarity with the original representation space. Additionally, we conduct experiments to showcase KRaM's efficacy in various settings, from erasing binary gender variables in word embeddings to vector-valued variables in GPT-3 representations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Existing long video retrieval systems are trained and tested in the paragraph-to-video retrieval regime, where every long video is described by a single long paragraph. This neglects the richness and variety of possible valid descriptions of a video, which could be described in moment-by-moment detail, or in a single phrase summary, or anything in between. To provide a more thorough evaluation of the capabilities of long video retrieval systems, we propose a pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art large language models to carefully generate a diverse set of synthetic captions for long videos. We validate this pipeline's fidelity via rigorous human inspection. We then benchmark a representative set of video language models on these synthetic captions using a few long video datasets, showing that they struggle with the transformed data, especially the shortest captions. We also propose a lightweight fine-tuning method, where we use a contrastive loss to learn a hierarchical embedding loss based on the differing levels of information among the various captions. Our method improves performance both on the downstream paragraph-to-video retrieval task (+1.1% R@1 on ActivityNet), as well as for the various long video retrieval metrics we compute using our synthetic data (+3.6% R@1 for short descriptions on ActivityNet).

    "abstract": "Do large language models (LLMs) exhibit sociodemographic biases, even when they decline to respond? To bypass their refusal to \"speak,\" we study this research question by probing contextualized embeddings and exploring whether this bias is encoded in its latent representations. We propose a logistic Bradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the words' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference tasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association test (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a relative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best represented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless tasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare ethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender. We observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral model implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and left-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests that instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized embeddings. Our codebase is at https://github.com/castorini/biasprobe",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in many tasks, much about their inner workings remains unclear. In this study, we present novel experimental insights into the resilience of LLMs, particularly GPT-4, when subjected to extensive character-level permutations. To investigate this, we first propose the Scrambled Bench, a suite designed to measure the capacity of LLMs to handle scrambled input, in terms of both recovering scrambled sentences and answering questions given scrambled context. The experimental results indicate that most powerful LLMs demonstrate the capability akin to typoglycemia, a phenomenon where humans can understand the meaning of words even when the letters within those words are scrambled, as long as the first and last letters remain in place. More surprisingly, we found that only GPT-4 nearly flawlessly processes inputs with unnatural errors, even under the extreme condition, a task that poses significant challenges for other LLMs and often even for humans. Specifically, GPT-4 can almost perfectly reconstruct the original sentences from scrambled ones, decreasing the edit distance by 95%, even when all letters within each word are entirely scrambled. It is counter-intuitive that LLMs can exhibit such resilience despite severe disruption to input tokenization caused by scrambled text",

There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks, and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 17% to 20% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability.

To facilitate instruction-modality fine-tuning, we collect high-quality instruction tuning data in an automatic and scalable manner, composed of 24K QA samples for audio and 250K QA samples for 3D. Leveraging instruction-aware representations, our model performs comparably with leading-edge counterparts without the need of extensive modality-specific pre-training or customization. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates cross-modal reasoning abilities across two or more input modalities, despite each modality projection being trained individually. To study the model's cross-modal abilities, we contribute a novel Discriminative Cross-modal Reasoning (DisCRn) evaluation task, comprising 9K audio-video QA samples and 28K image-3D QA samples that require the model to reason discriminatively across disparate input modalities",

    "abstract": "This paper presents our work for the Violence Inciting Text Detection shared task in the First Workshop on Bangla Language Processing. Social media has accelerated the propagation of hate and violence-inciting speech in society. It is essential to develop efficient mechanisms to detect and curb the propagation of such texts. The problem of detecting violence-inciting texts is further exacerbated in low-resource settings due to sparse research and less data. The data provided in the shared task consists of texts in the Bangla language, where each example is classified into one of the three categories defined based on the types of violence-inciting texts. We try and evaluate several BERT-based models, and then use an ensemble of the models as our final submission.

By aligning modalities with language for both encoding and generation, CoDi-2 empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to not only understand complex modality-interleaved instructions and in-context examples, but also autoregressively generate grounded and coherent multimodal outputs in the continuous feature space. To train CoDi-2, we build a large-scale generation dataset encompassing in-context multimodal instructions across text, vision, and audio. CoDi-2 demonstrates a wide range of zero-shot capabilities for multimodal generation, such as in-context learning, reasoning, and compositionality of any-to-any modality generation through multi-round interactive conversation. CoDi-2 surpasses previous domain-specific models on tasks such as subject-driven image generation, vision transformation, and audio editing. CoDi-2 signifies a substantial breakthrough in developing a comprehensive multimodal foundation model adept at interpreting in-context language-vision-audio interleaved instructions and producing multimodal outputs",

Our approach is simple, utilizing MLLMs to extend multiple captions for each image. To prevent the bias that introduced by MLLMs' hallucinations and intrinsic caption styles, we propose a \"text shearing\" to keep the lengths of extended captions identical to the originals. In image-text retrieval, our method consistently obtains 5.6 ~ 35.0% and 16.8 ~ 46.1% improvement on R@1 under the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, respectively.

    "title": "Can training neural language models on a curriculum with developmentally plausible data improve alignment with human reading behavior?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The use of neural language models to model human behavior has met with mixed success. While some work has found that the surprisal estimates from these models can be used to predict a wide range of human neural and behavioral responses, other work studying more complex syntactic phenomena has found that these surprisal estimates generate incorrect behavioral predictions. This paper explores the extent to which the misalignment between empirical and model-predicted behavior can be minimized by training models on more developmentally plausible data, such as in the BabyLM Challenge. We trained teacher language models on the BabyLM \"strict-small\" dataset and used sentence level surprisal estimates from these teacher models to create a curriculum. We found tentative evidence that our curriculum made it easier for models to acquire linguistic knowledge from the training data: on the subset of tasks in the BabyLM challenge suite evaluating models' grammatical knowledge of English, models first trained on the BabyLM data curriculum and then on a few randomly ordered training epochs performed slightly better than models trained on randomly ordered epochs alone. This improved linguistic knowledge acquisition did not result in better alignment with human reading behavior, however: models trained on the BabyLM dataset (with or without a curriculum) generated predictions that were as misaligned with human behavior as models trained on larger less curated datasets. This suggests that training on developmentally plausible datasets alone is likely insufficient to generate language models capable of accurately predicting human language processing",

    "abstract": "Recently, the incredible progress of large language models (LLMs) has ignited the spark of task automation, which decomposes the complex tasks described by user instructions into sub-tasks, and invokes external tools to execute them, and plays a central role in autonomous agents. However, there lacks a systematic and standardized benchmark to foster the development of LLMs in task automation. To this end, we introduce TaskBench to evaluate the capability of LLMs in task automation. Specifically, task automation can be formulated into three critical stages: task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction to fulfill user intent. This complexity makes data collection and evaluation more challenging compared to common NLP tasks. To generate high-quality evaluation datasets, we introduce the concept of Tool Graph to represent the decomposed tasks in user intent, and adopt a back-instruct method to simulate user instruction and annotations. Furthermore, we propose TaskEval to evaluate the capability of LLMs from different aspects, including task decomposition, tool invocation, and parameter prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that TaskBench can effectively reflects the capability of LLMs in task automation. Benefiting from the mixture of automated data construction and human verification, TaskBench achieves a high consistency compared to the human evaluation, which can be utilized as a comprehensive and faithful benchmark for LLM-based autonomous agents",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language model agents (LMA) recently emerged as a promising paradigm on muti-step decision making tasks, often outperforming humans and other reinforcement learning agents. Despite the promise, their performance on real-world applications that often involve combinations of tasks is still underexplored. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark, called CompWoB -- 50 new compositional web automation tasks reflecting more realistic assumptions. We show that while existing prompted LMAs (gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4) achieve 94.0% average success rate on base tasks, their performance degrades to 24.9% success rate on compositional tasks. On the other hand, transferred LMAs (finetuned only on base tasks) show less generalization gap, dropping from 85.4% to 54.8%. By balancing data distribution across tasks, we train a new model, HTML-T5++, that surpasses human-level performance (95.2%) on MiniWoB, and achieves the best zero-shot performance on CompWoB (61.5%). While these highlight the promise of small-scale finetuned and transferred models for compositional generalization, their performance further degrades under different instruction compositions changing combinational order. In contrast to the recent remarkable success of LMA, our benchmark and detailed analysis emphasize the necessity of building LMAs that are robust and generalizable to task compositionality for real-world deployment",

By representing functions as a generalization of arrays, we seamlessly use JAX's existing primitive system to implement higher-order functions.

For every introduced primitive operator, we derive and implement both linearization and transposition rules, aligning with JAX's internal protocols for forward and reverse mode automatic differentiation. This enhancement allows for functional differentiation in the same syntax traditionally use for functions. The resulting functional gradients are themselves functions ready to be invoked in python.

In this paper, we propose a new critique generation model called CritiqueLLM, which includes a dialogue-based prompting method for high-quality referenced / reference-free evaluation data. Experimental results show that our model can achieve comparable evaluation performance to GPT-4 especially in system-level correlations, and even outperform GPT-4 in 3 out of 8 tasks in a challenging reference-free setting.

In response to this need, this paper introduces ArcMMLU, a specialized benchmark tailored for the Library & Information Science (LIS) domain in Chinese. This benchmark aims to measure the knowledge and reasoning capability of LLMs within four key sub-domains: Archival Science, Data Science, Library Science, and Information Science. Following the format of MMLU/CMMLU, we collected over 6,000 high-quality questions for the compilation of ArcMMLU. This extensive compilation can reflect the diverse nature of the LIS domain and offer a robust foundation for LLM evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while most mainstream LLMs achieve an average accuracy rate above 50% on ArcMMLU, there remains a notable performance gap, suggesting substantial headroom for refinement in LLM capabilities within the LIS domain. Further analysis explores the effectiveness of few-shot examples on model performance and highlights challenging questions where models consistently underperform, providing valuable insights for targeted improvements.

    "abstract": "How much meaning influences gender assignment across languages is an active area of research in modern linguistics and cognitive science. We can view current approaches as aiming to determine where gender assignment falls on a spectrum, from being fully arbitrarily determined to being largely semantically determined. For the latter case, there is a formulation of the neo-Whorfian hypothesis, which claims that even inanimate noun gender influences how people conceive of and talk about objects (using the choice of adjective used to modify inanimate nouns as a proxy for meaning). We offer a novel, causal graphical model that jointly represents the interactions between a noun's grammatical gender, its meaning, and adjective choice. In accordance with past results, we find a relationship between the gender of nouns and the adjectives which modify them. However, when we control for the meaning of the noun, we find that grammatical gender has a near-zero effect on adjective choice, thereby calling the neo-Whorfian hypothesis into question",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "People in conversation entrain their linguistic behaviours through spontaneous alignment mechanisms [7] - both in face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) [8]. In CMC, one of the mechanisms through which linguistic entrainment happens is through explicit replies. Indeed, the use of explicit replies influences the structure of conversations, favouring the formation of reply-trees typically delineated by topic shifts [5]. The interpersonal coordination mechanisms realized by how actors address each other have been studied using a probabilistic framework proposed by David Gibson [2,3]. Other recent approaches use computational methods and information theory to quantify changes in text. We explore coordination mechanisms concerned with some of the roles utterances play in dialogues - specifically in explicit replies. We identify these roles by finding community structure in the conversation's vocabulary using a non-parametric, hierarchical topic model. Some conversations may always stay on the ground, remaining at the level of general introductory chatter. Some others may develop a specific sub-topic in significant depth and detail. Even others may jump between general chatter, out-of-topic remarks and people agreeing or disagreeing without further elaboration",

    "title": "IAG: Induction-Augmented Generation Framework for Answering Reasoning Questions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), by incorporating external knowledge with parametric memory of language models, has become the state-of-the-art architecture for open-domain QA tasks. However, common knowledge bases are inherently constrained by limited coverage and noisy information, making retrieval-based approaches inadequate to answer implicit reasoning questions. In this paper, we propose an Induction-Augmented Generation (IAG) framework that utilizes inductive knowledge along with the retrieved documents for implicit reasoning. We leverage large language models (LLMs) for deriving such knowledge via a novel prompting method based on inductive reasoning patterns. On top of this, we implement two versions of IAG named IAG-GPT and IAG-Student, respectively. IAG-GPT directly utilizes the knowledge generated by GPT-3 for answer prediction, while IAG-Student gets rid of dependencies on GPT service at inference time by incorporating a student inductor model. The inductor is firstly trained via knowledge distillation and further optimized by back-propagating the generator feedback via differentiable beam scores. Experimental results show that IAG outperforms RAG baselines as well as ChatGPT on two Open-Domain QA tasks. Notably, our best models have won the first place in the official leaderboards of CSQA2.0 (since Nov 1, 2022) and StrategyQA (since Jan 8, 2023)",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Semantic representations of text, i.e. representations of natural language which capture meaning by geometry, are essential for areas such as information retrieval and document grouping. High-dimensional trained dense vectors have received much attention in recent years as such representations. We investigate the structure of semantic spaces that arise from embeddings made with Sentence-BERT and find that the representations suffer from a well-known problem in high dimensions called hubness. Hubness results in asymmetric neighborhood relations, such that some texts (the hubs) are neighbours of many other texts while most texts (so-called anti-hubs), are neighbours of few or no other texts. We quantify the semantic quality of the embeddings using hubness scores and error rate of a neighbourhood based classifier. We find that when hubness is high, we can reduce error rate and hubness using hubness reduction methods. We identify a combination of two methods as resulting in the best reduction. For example, on one of the tested pretrained models, this combined method can reduce hubness by about 75% and error rate by about 9%. Thus, we argue that mitigating hubness in the embedding space provides better semantic representations of text",

For questions taken from an existing multiplechoice logical reading comprehension dataset, we crowdsource rationale texts that explain why we should select or eliminate answer options, resulting in 3,003 multiple-choice subquestions that are associated with 943 main questions. Experiments on our dataset show that recent large language models (e.g., InstructGPT) struggle to answer the subquestions even if they are able to answer the main questions correctly. We find that the models perform particularly poorly in answering subquestions written for the incorrect options of the main questions, implying that the models have a limited capability for explaining why incorrect alternatives should be eliminated. These results suggest that our dataset encourages further investigation into the critical reasoning ability of language models while focusing on the elimination process of relevant alternatives",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Radiology reports are an instrumental part of modern medicine, informing key clinical decisions such as diagnosis and treatment. The worldwide shortage of radiologists, however, restricts access to expert care and imposes heavy workloads, contributing to avoidable errors and delays in report delivery. While recent progress in automated report generation with vision-language models offer clear potential in ameliorating the situation, the path to real-world adoption has been stymied by the challenge of evaluating the clinical quality of AI-generated reports. In this study, we build a state-of-the-art report generation system for chest radiographs, Flamingo-CXR, by fine-tuning a well-known vision-language foundation model on radiology data. To evaluate the quality of the AI-generated reports, a group of 16 certified radiologists provide detailed evaluations of AI-generated and human written reports for chest X-rays from an intensive care setting in the United States and an inpatient setting in India. At least one radiologist (out of two per case) preferred the AI report to the ground truth report in over 60$\\%$ of cases for both datasets. Amongst the subset of AI-generated reports that contain errors, the most frequently cited reasons were related to the location and finding, whereas for human written reports, most mistakes were related to severity and finding. This disparity suggested potential complementarity between our AI system and human experts, prompting us to develop an assistive scenario in which Flamingo-CXR generates a first-draft report, which is subsequently revised by a clinician. This is the first demonstration of clinician-AI collaboration for report writing, and the resultant reports are assessed to be equivalent or preferred by at least one radiologist to reports written by experts alone in 80$\\%$ of in-patient cases and 66$\\%$ of intensive care cases",

However, the weak diagram analysis abilities of LLMs or Multimodal LLMs greatly limit their application scenarios, especially for scientific academic paper writing. In this work, towards a more versatile copilot for academic paper writing, we mainly focus on strengthening the multi-modal diagram analysis ability of Multimodal LLMs. By parsing Latex source files of high-quality papers, we carefully build a multi-modal diagram understanding dataset M-Paper. By aligning diagrams in the paper with related paragraphs, we construct professional diagram analysis samples for training and evaluation. M-Paper is the first dataset to support joint comprehension of multiple scientific diagrams, including figures and tables in the format of images or Latex codes. Besides, to better align the copilot with the user's intention, we introduce the `outline' as the control signal, which could be directly given by the user or revised based on auto-generated ones. Comprehensive experiments with a state-of-the-art Mumtimodal LLM demonstrate that training on our dataset shows stronger scientific diagram understanding performance, including diagram captioning, diagram analysis, and outline recommendation.

    "title": "LMRL Gym: Benchmarks for Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning with Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) provide excellent text-generation capabilities, but standard prompting and generation methods generally do not lead to intentional or goal-directed agents and might necessitate considerable prompt tuning. This becomes particularly apparent in multi-turn conversations: even the best current LLMs rarely ask clarifying questions, engage in explicit information gathering, or take actions now that lead to better decisions after multiple turns. Reinforcement learning has the potential to leverage the powerful modeling capabilities of LLMs, as well as their internal representation of textual interactions, to create capable goal-directed language agents. This can enable intentional and temporally extended interactions, such as with humans, through coordinated persuasion and carefully crafted questions, or in goal-directed play through text games to bring about desired final outcomes. However, enabling this requires the community to develop stable and reliable reinforcement learning algorithms that can effectively train LLMs. Developing such algorithms requires tasks that can gauge progress on algorithm design, provide accessible and reproducible evaluations for multi-turn interactions, and cover a range of task properties and challenges in improving reinforcement learning algorithms. Our paper introduces the LMRL-Gym benchmark for evaluating multi-turn RL for LLMs, together with an open-source research framework containing a basic toolkit for getting started on multi-turn RL with offline value-based and policy-based RL methods. Our benchmark consists of 8 different language tasks, which require multiple rounds of language interaction and cover a range of tasks in open-ended dialogue and text games",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided translation (CAT) aims to enhance human translation efficiency and is still important in scenarios where machine translation cannot meet quality requirements. One fundamental task within this field is Word-Level Auto Completion (WLAC). WLAC predicts a target word given a source sentence, translation context, and a human typed character sequence. Previous works either employ word classification models to exploit contextual information from both sides of the target word or directly disregarded the dependencies from the right-side context. Furthermore, the key information, i.e. human typed sequences, is only used as prefix constraints in the decoding module. In this paper, we propose the INarIG (Iterative Non-autoregressive Instruct Generation) model, which constructs the human typed sequence into Instruction Unit and employs iterative decoding with subwords to fully utilize input information given in the task. Our model is more competent in dealing with low-frequency words (core scenario of this task), and achieves state-of-the-art results on the WMT22 and benchmark datasets, with a maximum increase of over 10% prediction accuracy",

While previous approaches have made significant strides in generating versatile scenes based on text descriptions and a few input images, challenges persist in maintaining the subject fidelity within the generated images. In this work, we introduce an innovative algorithm named HiFi Tuner to enhance the appearance preservation of objects during personalized image generation. Our proposed method employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework, comprising a denoising process and a pivotal inversion process. Key enhancements include the utilization of mask guidance, a novel parameter regularization technique, and the incorporation of step-wise subject representations to elevate the sample fidelity. Additionally, we propose a reference-guided generation approach that leverages the pivotal inversion of a reference image to mitigate unwanted subject variations and artifacts. We further extend our method to a novel image editing task: substituting the subject in an image through textual manipulations. Experimental evaluations conducted on the DreamBooth dataset using the Stable Diffusion model showcase promising results. Fine-tuning solely on textual embeddings improves CLIP-T score by 3.6 points and improves DINO score by 9.6 points over Textual Inversion. When fine-tuning all parameters, HiFi Tuner improves CLIP-T score by 1.2 points and improves DINO score by 1.2 points over DreamBooth, establishing a new state of the art",

The expertly curated dataset includes annotations for 5,952 tweets, assessing their relevance to COVID-19 vaccines, presence of misinformation, and the themes of the misinformation. To address challenges posed by domain specificity, the low-resource setting, and data imbalance, we adopt two approaches for developing COVID-19 vaccine misinformation detection models: domain-specific pre-training and text augmentation using a large language model. Our best misinformation detection models demonstrate improvements ranging from 2.7 to 15.9 percentage points in macro F1-score compared to the baseline models. Additionally, we apply our misinformation detection models in a large-scale study of 19 million unlabeled tweets from the three countries between 2020 and 2022, showcasing the practical application of our dataset and models for detecting and analyzing vaccine misinformation in multiple countries and languages. Our analysis indicates that percentage changes in the number of new COVID-19 cases are positively associated with COVID-19 vaccine misinformation rates in a staggered manner for Brazil and Indonesia, and there are significant positive associations between the misinformation rates across the three countries",

Despite the impressive ICL ability of LLMs, it has also been found that ICL in LLMs is sensitive to input demonstrations and limited to short context lengths. To understand the limitations and principles for successful ICL, we conduct an investigation with ICL linear regression of transformers. We characterize several Out-of-Distribution (OOD) cases for ICL inspired by realistic LLM ICL failures and compare transformers with DeepSet, a simple yet powerful architecture for ICL. Surprisingly, DeepSet outperforms transformers across a variety of distribution shifts, implying that preserving permutation invariance symmetry to input demonstrations is crucial for OOD ICL. The phenomenon specifies a fundamental requirement by ICL, which we termed as ICL invariance. Nevertheless, the positional encodings in LLMs will break ICL invariance. To this end, we further evaluate transformers with identical positional encodings and find preserving ICL invariance in transformers achieves state-of-the-art performance across various ICL distribution shifts",

    "abstract": "Transformers have become the gold standard for many natural language processing tasks and, in particular, for multi-hop question answering (MHQA). This task includes processing a long document and reasoning over the multiple parts of it. The landscape of MHQA approaches can be classified into two primary categories. The first group focuses on extracting supporting evidence, thereby constraining the QA model's context to predicted facts. Conversely, the second group relies on the attention mechanism of the long input encoding model to facilitate multi-hop reasoning. However, attention-based token representations lack explicit global contextual information to connect reasoning steps. To address these issues, we propose GEMFormer, a two-stage method that first collects relevant information over the entire document to the memory and then combines it with local context to solve the task. Our experimental results show that fine-tuning a pre-trained model with memory-augmented input, including the most certain global elements, improves the model's performance on three MHQA datasets compared to the baseline. We also found that the global explicit memory contains information from supporting facts required for the correct answer",

Generated counterspeech, however, can be viable only when grounded in the context of topic, audience and sensitivity as these factors influence both the efficacy and appropriateness. In this work, we propose a novel framework based on theories of discourse to study the inferential links that connect counter speeches to the hateful comment. Within this framework, we propose: i) a taxonomy of counterspeech derived from discourse frameworks, and ii) discourse-informed prompting strategies for generating contextually-grounded counterspeech. To construct and validate this framework, we present a process for collecting an in-the-wild dataset of counterspeech from Reddit. Using this process, we manually annotate a dataset of 3.9k Reddit comment pairs for the presence of hatespeech and counterspeech. The positive pairs are annotated for 10 classes in our proposed taxonomy. We annotate these pairs with paraphrased counterparts to remove offensiveness and first-person references. We show that by using our dataset and framework, large language models can generate contextually-grounded counterspeech informed by theories of discourse.

Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold: (1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in the paper. The comparison of those benchmarks gives us insights about the bias and toxicity of the compared models. Therefore, we explore the frequency of demographic terms in common LLM pre-training corpora and how this may relate to model biases. (2) Mitigation: we conduct a comprehensive study of how well 3 bias/toxicity mitigation techniques perform across our suite of measurements. ROBBIE aims to provide insights for practitioners while deploying a model, emphasizing the need to not only measure potential harms, but also understand how they arise by characterizing the data, mitigate harms once found, and balance any trade-offs.

We trained our model using the same approach for RoBERTa model and evaluated on two text classification tasks: Sentiment Classification and Hate Speech Detection. We demonstrate that TurkishBERTweet outperforms the other available alternatives on generalizability and its lower inference time gives significant advantage to process large-scale datasets. We also compared our models with the commercial OpenAI solutions in terms of cost and performance to demonstrate TurkishBERTweet is scalable and cost-effective solution. As part of our research, we released TurkishBERTweet and fine-tuned LoRA adapters for the mentioned tasks under the MIT License to facilitate future research and applications on Turkish social media. Our TurkishBERTweet model is available at: https://github.com/ViralLab/TurkishBERTweet",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Potential harms of Large Language Models such as mass misinformation and plagiarism can be partially mitigated if there exists a reliable way to detect machine generated text. In this paper, we propose a new watermarking method to detect machine-generated texts. Our method embeds a unique pattern within the generated text, ensuring that while the content remains coherent and natural to human readers, it carries distinct markers that can be identified algorithmically. Specifically, we intervene with the token sampling process in a way which enables us to trace back our token choices during the detection phase. We show how watermarking affects textual quality and compare our proposed method with a state-of-the-art watermarking method in terms of robustness and detectability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our watermarking scheme in distinguishing between watermarked and non-watermarked text, achieving high detection rates while maintaining textual quality",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Cross-lingual transfer learning is an important property of multilingual large language models (LLMs). But how do LLMs represent relationships between languages? Every language model has an input layer that maps tokens to vectors. This ubiquitous layer of language models is often overlooked. We find that similarities between these input embeddings are highly interpretable and that the geometry of these embeddings differs between model families. In one case (XLM-RoBERTa), embeddings encode language: tokens in different writing systems can be linearly separated with an average of 99.2% accuracy. Another family (mT5) represents cross-lingual semantic similarity: the 50 nearest neighbors for any token represent an average of 7.61 writing systems, and are frequently translations. This result is surprising given that there is no explicit parallel cross-lingual training corpora and no explicit incentive for translations in pre-training objectives. Our research opens the door for investigations in 1) The effect of pre-training and model architectures on representations of languages and 2) The applications of cross-lingual representations embedded in language models",

    "title": "Filtered Semi-Markov CRF",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Semi-Markov CRF has been proposed as an alternative to the traditional Linear Chain CRF for text segmentation tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Unlike CRF, which treats text segmentation as token-level prediction, Semi-CRF considers segments as the basic unit, making it more expressive. However, Semi-CRF suffers from two major drawbacks: (1) quadratic complexity over sequence length, as it operates on every span of the input sequence, and (2) inferior performance compared to CRF for sequence labeling tasks like NER. In this paper, we introduce Filtered Semi-Markov CRF, a variant of Semi-CRF that addresses these issues by incorporating a filtering step to eliminate irrelevant segments, reducing complexity and search space. Our approach is evaluated on several NER benchmarks, where it outperforms both CRF and Semi-CRF while being significantly faster.

    "title": "Knowledge Pursuit Prompting for Zero-Shot Multimodal Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Hallucinations and unfaithful synthesis due to inaccurate prompts with insufficient semantic details are widely observed in multimodal generative models. A prevalent strategy to align multiple modalities is to fine-tune the generator with a large number of annotated text-image pairs. However, such a procedure is labor-consuming and resource-draining. The key question we ask is: can we enhance the quality and faithfulness of text-driven generative models beyond extensive text-image pair annotations? To address this question, we propose Knowledge Pursuit Prompting (KPP), a zero-shot framework that iteratively incorporates external knowledge to help generators produce reliable visual content. Instead of training generators to handle generic prompts, KPP employs a recursive knowledge query process to gather informative external facts from the knowledge base, instructs a language model to compress the acquired knowledge for prompt refinement, and utilizes text-driven generators for visual synthesis. The entire process is zero-shot, without accessing the architectures and parameters of generative models. We evaluate the framework across multiple text-driven generative tasks (image, 3D rendering, and video) on datasets of different domains. We further demonstrate the extensibility and adaptability of KPP through varying foundation model bases and instructions. Our results show that KPP is capable of generating faithful and semantically rich content across diverse visual domains, offering a promising solution to improve multimodal generative models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There is a significant disconnect between linguistic theory and modern NLP practice, which relies heavily on inscrutable black-box architectures. DisCoCirc is a newly proposed model for meaning that aims to bridge this divide, by providing neuro-symbolic models that incorporate linguistic structure. DisCoCirc represents natural language text as a `circuit' that captures the core semantic information of the text. These circuits can then be interpreted as modular machine learning models. Additionally, DisCoCirc fulfils another major aim of providing an NLP model that can be implemented on near-term quantum computers. In this paper we describe a software pipeline that converts English text to its DisCoCirc representation. The pipeline achieves coverage over a large fragment of the English language. It relies on Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) parses of the input text as well as coreference resolution information. This semantic and syntactic information is used in several steps to convert the text into a simply-typed $\\lambda$-calculus term, and then into a circuit diagram. This pipeline will enable the application of the DisCoCirc framework to NLP tasks, using both classical and quantum approaches",

    "abstract": "In this study, we are interested in imbuing robots with the capability of physically-grounded task planning. Recent advancements have shown that large language models (LLMs) possess extensive knowledge useful in robotic tasks, especially in reasoning and planning. However, LLMs are constrained by their lack of world grounding and dependence on external affordance models to perceive environmental information, which cannot jointly reason with LLMs. We argue that a task planner should be an inherently grounded, unified multimodal system. To this end, we introduce Robotic Vision-Language Planning (ViLa), a novel approach for long-horizon robotic planning that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to generate a sequence of actionable steps. ViLa directly integrates perceptual data into its reasoning and planning process, enabling a profound understanding of commonsense knowledge in the visual world, including spatial layouts and object attributes. It also supports flexible multimodal goal specification and naturally incorporates visual feedback. Our extensive evaluation, conducted in both real-robot and simulated environments, demonstrates ViLa's superiority over existing LLM-based planners, highlighting its effectiveness in a wide array of open-world manipulation tasks",

As a special case, we show how to translate from the Lambek calculus into Peirce's system beta for first-order logic.

These methods use contrastive learning technique and are tailored specifically for the handwriting domain. They can be applied to any encoder-decoder model that works with digital ink. We demonstrate that our method reduces the character error rate on long-form English data by half compared to baseline RNN and by 16% compared to the previous approach that aims at addressing the same problem.

We utilize this feature to develop an infilling-augmented decoding process that facilitates non-monotonic generation. This approach allows for postponing the generation of uncertain code snippets until a definitive suffix is established, leading to improved control over the generation sequence. In addition, it facilitates a looping mechanism, which can iteratively update and synchronize each piece of generation in a cyclic manner.

A prominent obstacle that specifically hinders headline generation in Indian languages is the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. To address this crucial gap, we proudly present Mukhyansh, an extensive multilingual dataset, tailored for Indian language headline generation.

In this paper, we compare two different approaches to train a stateless Transducer-based E2E joint rich and normalized ASR system, ready for streaming applications, with a limited amount of rich labeled data. The first approach uses a language model to generate pseudo-rich transcriptions of normalized training data. The second approach uses a single decoder conditioned on the type of the output. The first approach leads to E2E rich ASR which perform better on out-of-domain data, with up to 9% relative reduction in errors.

Sentence transformers are the NLP counterparts to this architecture, and have been growing in popularity due to their rich and effective sentence representations. Having effective sentence representations is paramount in multiple tasks, such as information retrieval, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and sentence comparison. Keeping in mind the deployability factor of transformers, evaluating the robustness of sentence transformers is of utmost importance. This work focuses on evaluating the robustness of the sentence encoders. We employ several adversarial attacks to evaluate its robustness. This system uses character-level attacks in the form of random character substitution, word-level attacks in the form of synonym replacement, and sentence-level attacks in the form of intra-sentence word order shuffling. The results of the experiments strongly undermine the robustness of sentence encoders. The models produce significantly different predictions as well as embeddings on perturbed datasets. The accuracy of the models can fall up to 15 percent on perturbed datasets as compared to unperturbed datasets. Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate that these embeddings does capture the semantic and syntactic structure (sentence order) of sentences. However, existing supervised classification strategies fail to leverage this information, and merely function as n-gram detectors",

Specifically, we focus on learning language-grounded visual features to enhance the world model learning, a model-based reinforcement learning technique. To enforce our hypothesis explicitly, we mask out the bounding boxes of a few objects in the image observation and provide the text prompt as descriptions for these masked objects. Subsequently, we predict the masked objects along with the surrounding regions as pixel reconstruction, similar to the transformer-based masked autoencoder approach. Our proposed LanGWM: Language Grounded World Model achieves state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution test at the 100K interaction steps benchmarks of iGibson point navigation tasks. Furthermore, our proposed technique of explicit language-grounded visual representation learning has the potential to improve models for human-robot interaction because our extracted visual features are language grounded",

    "abstract": "Query-focused Summarization (QfS) deals with systems that generate summaries from document(s) based on a query. Motivated by the insight that Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a generalization to Supervised Learning (SL) for Natural Language Generation, and thereby performs better (empirically) than SL, we use an RL-based approach for this task of QfS. Additionally, we also resolve the conflict of employing RL in Transformers with Teacher Forcing. We develop multiple Policy Gradient networks, trained on various reward signals: ROUGE, BLEU, and Semantic Similarity, which lead to a 10-point improvement over the State-of-the-Art approach on the ROUGE-L metric for a benchmark dataset (ELI5). We also show performance of our approach in zero-shot setting for another benchmark dataset (DebatePedia) -- our approach leads to results comparable to baselines, which were specifically trained on DebatePedia. To aid the RL training, we propose a better semantic similarity reward, enabled by a novel Passage Embedding scheme developed using Cluster Hypothesis. Lastly, we contribute a gold-standard test dataset to further research in QfS and Long-form Question Answering (LfQA)",

    "abstract": "Community Question Answering (CQA) becomes increasingly prevalent in recent years. However, there are a large number of answers, which is difficult for users to select the relevant answers. Therefore, answer selection is a very significant subtask of CQA. In this paper, we first propose the Question-Answer cross attention networks (QAN) with pre-trained models for answer selection and utilize large language model (LLM) to perform answer selection with knowledge augmentation. Specifically, we apply the BERT model as the encoder layer to do pre-training for question subjects, question bodies and answers, respectively, then the cross attention mechanism selects the most relevant answer for different questions. Experiments show that the QAN model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, SemEval2015 and SemEval2017. Moreover, we use the LLM to generate external knowledge from questions and correct answers to achieve knowledge augmentation for the answer selection task by LLM, while optimizing the prompt of LLM in different aspects. The results show that the introduction of external knowledge can improve the correct answer selection rate of LLM on datasets SemEval2015 and SemEval2017.

To develop this model, we utilize valuable resources such as the Manwen Laodang(a historical book) and a Manchu-Korean dictionary. Due to the scarcity of a Manchu-Korean parallel dataset, we expand our data by employing word replacement guided by GloVe embeddings, trained on both monolingual and parallel texts. Our approach is built around an encoder-decoder neural machine translation model, incorporating a bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer.

This paper introduces Taiwan LLM, a pioneering Large Language Model that specifically caters to the Traditional Chinese language, with a focus on the variant used in Taiwan. Leveraging a comprehensive pretraining corpus and instruction-finetuning datasets, we have developed a model that not only understands the complexities of Traditional Chinese but also embodies the cultural context of Taiwan. Taiwan LLM represents the first of its kind, a model that is not only linguistically accurate but also culturally resonant with its user base. Our evaluations demonstrate that Taiwan LLM achieves superior performance in understanding and generating Traditional Chinese text, outperforming existing models that are predominantly trained on Simplified Chinese or English. The open-source release of Taiwan LLM invites collaboration and further innovation, ensuring that the linguistic diversity of Chinese speakers is embraced and well-served.

    "abstract": "Prompt-based learning has been widely applied in many low-resource NLP tasks such as few-shot scenarios. However, this paradigm has been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Most of the existing attack methods focus on inserting manually predefined templates as triggers in the pre-training phase to train the victim model and utilize the same triggers in the downstream task to perform inference, which tends to ignore the transferability and stealthiness of the templates. In this work, we propose a novel approach of TARGET (Template-trAnsfeRable backdoor attack aGainst prompt-basEd NLP models via GPT4), which is a data-independent attack method. Specifically, we first utilize GPT4 to reformulate manual templates to generate tone-strong and normal templates, and the former are injected into the model as a backdoor trigger in the pre-training phase. Then, we not only directly employ the above templates in the downstream task, but also use GPT4 to generate templates with similar tone to the above templates to carry out transferable attacks. Finally we have conducted extensive experiments on five NLP datasets and three BERT series models, with experimental results justifying that our TARGET method has better attack performance and stealthiness compared to the two-external baseline methods on direct attacks, and in addition achieves satisfactory attack capability in the unseen tone-similar templates",

We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently.

    "title": "Improving the Robustness of Transformer-based Large Language Models with Dynamic Attention",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based models, such as BERT and GPT, have been widely adopted in natural language processing (NLP) due to their exceptional performance. However, recent studies show their vulnerability to textual adversarial attacks where the model's output can be misled by intentionally manipulating the text inputs. Despite various methods that have been proposed to enhance the model's robustness and mitigate this vulnerability, many require heavy consumption resources (e.g., adversarial training) or only provide limited protection (e.g., defensive dropout). In this paper, we propose a novel method called dynamic attention, tailored for the transformer architecture, to enhance the inherent robustness of the model itself against various adversarial attacks. Our method requires no downstream task knowledge and does not incur additional costs. The proposed dynamic attention consists of two modules: (I) attention rectification, which masks or weakens the attention value of the chosen tokens, and (ii) dynamic modeling, which dynamically builds the set of candidate tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that dynamic attention significantly mitigates the impact of adversarial attacks, improving up to 33\\% better performance than previous methods against widely-used adversarial attacks. The model-level design of dynamic attention enables it to be easily combined with other defense methods (e.g., adversarial training) to further enhance the model's robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic attention preserves the state-of-the-art robustness space of the original model compared to other dynamic modeling methods",

    "abstract": "The open-endedness of large language models (LLMs) combined with their impressive capabilities may lead to new safety issues when being exploited for malicious use. While recent studies primarily focus on probing toxic outputs that can be easily detected with existing toxicity classifiers, we show that LLMs can generate diverse implicit toxic outputs that are exceptionally difficult to detect via simply zero-shot prompting. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based attacking method to further induce the implicit toxicity in LLMs. Specifically, we optimize the language model with a reward that prefers implicit toxic outputs to explicit toxic and non-toxic ones. Experiments on five widely-adopted toxicity classifiers demonstrate that the attack success rate can be significantly improved through RL fine-tuning. For instance, the RL-finetuned LLaMA-13B model achieves an attack success rate of 90.04% on BAD and 62.85% on Davinci003. Our findings suggest that LLMs pose a significant threat in generating undetectable implicit toxic outputs. We further show that fine-tuning toxicity classifiers on the annotated examples from our attacking method can effectively enhance their ability to detect LLM-generated implicit toxic language.

Focusing on dialog applications, we propose a novel framework, CESAR, that unifies a large number of dialog tasks in the same format and allows programmatic induction of complex instructions without any manual effort. We apply CESAR on InstructDial, a benchmark for instruction-based dialog tasks. We further enhance InstructDial with new datasets and tasks and utilize CESAR to induce complex tasks with compositional instructions. This results in a new benchmark called InstructDial++, which includes 63 datasets with 86 basic tasks and 68 composite tasks. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate the scalability of CESAR in providing rich instructions. Models trained on InstructDial++ can follow compositional prompts, such as prompts that ask for multiple stylistic constraints",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning has laid the foundation for deploying deep learning models. However, most fine-tuning methods are designed to meet a specific resource budget. Recently, considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets, stitchable neural network (SN-Net) is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising, SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains, including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work, we present a novel framework, Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA), to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically, we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way, we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore, we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline, which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches, we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family, obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes",

    "abstract": "Public events, such as concerts and sports games, can be major attractors for large crowds, leading to irregular surges in travel demand. Accurate human mobility prediction for public events is thus crucial for event planning as well as traffic or crowd management. While rich textual descriptions about public events are commonly available from online sources, it is challenging to encode such information in statistical or machine learning models. Existing methods are generally limited in incorporating textual information, handling data sparsity, or providing rationales for their predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a framework for human mobility prediction under public events (LLM-MPE) based on Large Language Models (LLMs), leveraging their unprecedented ability to process textual data, learn from minimal examples, and generate human-readable explanations. Specifically, LLM-MPE first transforms raw, unstructured event descriptions from online sources into a standardized format, and then segments historical mobility data into regular and event-related components. A prompting strategy is designed to direct LLMs in making and rationalizing demand predictions considering historical mobility and event features. A case study is conducted for Barclays Center in New York City, based on publicly available event information and taxi trip data. Results show that LLM-MPE surpasses traditional models, particularly on event days, with textual data significantly enhancing its accuracy. Furthermore, LLM-MPE offers interpretable insights into its predictions. Despite the great potential of LLMs, we also identify key challenges including misinformation and high costs that remain barriers to their broader adoption in large-scale human mobility analysis",

We introduce DreamSync, a model-agnostic training algorithm by design that improves T2I models to be faithful to the text input. DreamSync builds off a recent insight from TIFA's evaluation framework -- that large vision-language models (VLMs) can effectively identify the fine-grained discrepancies between generated images and the text inputs. DreamSync uses this insight to train T2I models without any labeled data; it improves T2I models using its own generations. First, it prompts the model to generate several candidate images for a given input text. Then, it uses two VLMs to select the best generation: a Visual Question Answering model that measures the alignment of generated images to the text, and another that measures the generation's aesthetic quality. After selection, we use LoRA to iteratively finetune the T2I model to guide its generation towards the selected best generations. DreamSync does not need any additional human annotation. model architecture changes, or reinforcement learning. Despite its simplicity, DreamSync improves both the semantic alignment and aesthetic appeal of two diffusion-based T2I models, evidenced by multiple benchmarks (+1.7% on TIFA, +2.9% on DSG1K, +3.4% on VILA aesthetic) and human evaluation",

Solutions such as pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning add substantial computational overhead, and the latter require domain-expertise.

Here, we introduce a task-agnostic Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) framework by leveraging the massive biomedical KG SPOKE with LLMs such as Llama-2-13b, GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, to generate meaningful biomedical text rooted in established knowledge.

Notably, KG-RAG provides a remarkable 71% boost in the performance of the Llama-2 model on the challenging MCQ dataset, demonstrating the framework's capacity to empower open-source models with fewer parameters for domain-specific questions. Furthermore, KG-RAG enhanced the performance of proprietary GPT models, such as GPT-3.5 which exhibited improvement over GPT-4 in context utilization on MCQ data. Our approach was also able to address drug repurposing questions, returning meaningful repurposing suggestions. In summary, the proposed framework combines explicit and implicit knowledge of KG and LLM, respectively, in an optimized fashion, thus enhancing the adaptability of general-purpose LLMs to tackle domain-specific questions in a unified framework",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription is the most critical form of TCM treatment, and uncovering the complex nonlinear relationship between symptoms and TCM is of great significance for clinical practice and assisting physicians in diagnosis and treatment. Although there have been some studies on TCM prescription generation, these studies consider a single factor and directly model the symptom-prescription generation problem mainly based on symptom descriptions, lacking guidance from TCM knowledge. To this end, we propose a RoBERTa and Knowledge Enhancement model for Prescription Generation of Traditional Chinese Medicine (RoKEPG). RoKEPG is firstly pre-trained by our constructed TCM corpus, followed by fine-tuning the pre-trained model, and the model is guided to generate TCM prescriptions by introducing four classes of knowledge of TCM through the attention mask matrix. Experimental results on the publicly available TCM prescription dataset show that RoKEPG improves the F1 metric by about 2% over the baseline model with the best results",

In short, we believe the perspective of researchers and educators can add some clarity to the public's understanding of the technologies beyond what's currently available, which tends to be either extremely technical or promotional material generated about products by their purveyors. Our approach teases apart the concept of a language model from products built on them, from the behaviors attributed to or desired from those products, and from claims about similarity to human cognition. As a starting point, we (1) offer a scientific viewpoint that focuses on questions amenable to study through experimentation; (2) situate language models as they are today in the context of the research that led to their development; and (3) describe the boundaries of what is known about the models at this writing",

    "abstract": "In Natural Language Processing (NLP), the Elo rating system, originally designed for ranking players in dynamic games such as chess, is increasingly being used to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) through \"A vs B\" paired comparisons. However, while popular, the system's suitability for assessing entities with constant skill levels, such as LLMs, remains relatively unexplored. We study two fundamental axioms that evaluation methods should adhere to: reliability and transitivity. We conduct extensive evaluation of Elo behaviour, illustrating that individual Elo computations exhibit volatility and delving into the impact of varying the Elo rating system's hyperparameters. We show that these axioms are not always satisfied raising questions about the reliability of current comparative evaluations of LLMs. If the current use of Elo scores is intended to substitute the costly head-to-head comparison of LLMs, it is crucial to ensure the ranking is as robust as possible. Guided by the axioms, our findings offer concrete guidelines for enhancing the reliability of LLM evaluation methods, suggesting a need for reassessment of existing comparative approaches",

We find that nonsensical or irrelevant language instructions during pretraining can have little effect on downstream performance for both HAMT and VLN-BERT on R2R, and is still better than only using clean, human data. To underscore these results, we concoct an efficient augmentation method, Unigram + Object, which generates nonsensical instructions that nonetheless improve downstream performance.

    "abstract": "Prosody -- the suprasegmental component of speech, including pitch, loudness, and tempo -- carries critical aspects of meaning. However, the relationship between the information conveyed by prosody vs. by the words themselves remains poorly understood. We use large language models (LLMs) to estimate how much information is redundant between prosody and the words themselves. Using a large spoken corpus of English audiobooks, we extract prosodic features aligned to individual words and test how well they can be predicted from LLM embeddings, compared to non-contextual word embeddings. We find a high degree of redundancy between the information carried by the words and prosodic information across several prosodic features, including intensity, duration, pauses, and pitch contours. Furthermore, a word's prosodic information is redundant with both the word itself and the context preceding as well as following it. Still, we observe that prosodic features can not be fully predicted from text, suggesting that prosody carries information above and beyond the words. Along with this paper, we release a general-purpose data processing pipeline for quantifying the relationship between linguistic information and extra-linguistic features",

By evaluating the simulation effectiveness, we examine the advancements and limitations of cutting-edge AI systems' abilities in studying complex collective human behaviors such as international conflicts under diverse settings. In these simulations, the emergent interactions among agents also offer a novel perspective for examining the triggers and conditions that lead to war. Our findings offer data-driven and AI-augmented insights that can redefine how we approach conflict resolution and peacekeeping strategies.

    "volume": "Dec",
    "abstract": "Radiologists produce unstructured data that could be valuable for clinical care when consumed by information systems. However, variability in style limits usage. Study compares performance of system using domain-adapted language model (RadLing) and general-purpose large language model (GPT-4) in extracting common data elements (CDE) from thoracic radiology reports. Three radiologists annotated a retrospective dataset of 1300 thoracic reports (900 training, 400 test) and mapped to 21 pre-selected relevant CDEs. RadLing was used to generate embeddings for sentences and identify CDEs using cosine-similarity, which were mapped to values using light-weight mapper. GPT-4 system used OpenAI's general-purpose embeddings to identify relevant CDEs and used GPT-4 to map to values. The output CDE:value pairs were compared to the reference standard; an identical match was considered true positive. Precision (positive predictive value) was 96% (2700/2824) for RadLing and 99% (2034/2047) for GPT-4. Recall (sensitivity) was 94% (2700/2876) for RadLing and 70% (2034/2887) for GPT-4; the difference was statistically significant (P<.001). RadLing's domain-adapted embeddings were more sensitive in CDE identification (95% vs 71%) and its light-weight mapper had comparable precision in value assignment (95.4% vs 95.0%). RadLing system exhibited higher performance than GPT-4 system in extracting CDEs from radiology reports. RadLing system's domain-adapted embeddings outperform general-purpose embeddings from OpenAI in CDE identification and its light-weight value mapper achieves comparable precision to large GPT-4. RadLing system offers operational advantages including local deployment and reduced runtime costs. Domain-adapted RadLing system surpasses GPT-4 system in extracting common data elements from radiology reports, while providing benefits of local deployment and lower costs",

We argue that this question cannot be answered from the X-ray alone and requires a pragmatic perspective, which captures the communicative goal that radiology reports serve between radiologists and patients. However, the standard image-to-text formulation for radiology report generation fails to incorporate such pragmatic intents. Following this pragmatic perspective, we demonstrate that the indication, which describes why a patient comes for an X-ray, drives the mentions of negative observations and introduce indications as additional input to report generation. With respect to the output, we develop a framework to identify uninferable information from the image as a source of model hallucinations, and limit them by cleaning groundtruth reports. Finally, we use indications and cleaned groundtruth reports to develop pragmatic models, and show that they outperform existing methods not only in new pragmatics-inspired metrics (+4.3 Negative F1) but also in standard metrics (+6.3 Positive F1 and +11.0 BLEU-2)",

In this work, we introduce MobileCLIP -- a new family of efficient image-text models optimized for runtime performance along with a novel and efficient training approach, namely multi-modal reinforced training. The proposed training approach leverages knowledge transfer from an image captioning model and an ensemble of strong CLIP encoders to improve the accuracy of efficient models.

MobileCLIP sets a new state-of-the-art latency-accuracy tradeoff for zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks on several datasets. Our MobileCLIP-S2 variant is 2.3$\\times$ faster while more accurate compared to previous best CLIP model based on ViT-B/16. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-modal reinforced training by training a CLIP model based on ViT-B/16 image backbone and achieving +2.9% average performance improvement on 38 evaluation benchmarks compared to the previous best. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach achieves 10$\\times$-1000$\\times$ improved learning efficiency when compared with non-reinforced CLIP training",

Current VLMs, while proficient in tasks like image captioning and visual question answering, face computational burdens when processing long videos due to the excessive visual tokens. LLaMA-VID addresses this issue by representing each frame with two distinct tokens, namely context token and content token. The context token encodes the overall image context based on user input, whereas the content token encapsulates visual cues in each frame. This dual-token strategy significantly reduces the overload of long videos while preserving critical information. Generally, LLaMA-VID empowers existing frameworks to support hour-long videos and pushes their upper limit with an extra context token. It is proved to surpass previous methods on most of video- or image-based benchmarks. Code is available https://github.com/dvlab-research/LLaMA-VID}{https://github.com/dvlab-research/LLaMA-VID",

We propose a novel training method $\\mathbb{E}$fficient $\\mathbb{I}$n-context $\\mathbb{L}$earning on $\\mathbb{E}$gocentric $\\mathbb{V}$ideos ($\\mathbb{EILEV}$), which elicits in-context learning in VLMs for egocentric videos without requiring massive, naturalistic egocentric video datasets. $\\mathbb{EILEV}$ involves architectural and training data adaptations to allow the model to process contexts interleaved with video clips and narrations, sampling of in-context examples with clusters of similar verbs and nouns, use of data with skewed marginal distributions with a long tail of infrequent verbs and nouns, as well as homonyms and synonyms. Our evaluations show that $\\mathbb{EILEV}$-trained models outperform larger VLMs trained on a huge amount of naturalistic data in in-context learning.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand model behaviors in terms of specific, interpretable features, often hypothesized to manifest as low-dimensional subspaces of activations. Specifically, recent studies have explored subspace interventions (such as activation patching) as a way to simultaneously manipulate model behavior and attribute the features behind it to given subspaces. In this work, we demonstrate that these two aims diverge, potentially leading to an illusory sense of interpretability. Counterintuitively, even if a subspace intervention makes the model's output behave as if the value of a feature was changed, this effect may be achieved by activating a dormant parallel pathway leveraging another subspace that is causally disconnected from model outputs. We demonstrate this phenomenon in a distilled mathematical example, in two real-world domains (the indirect object identification task and factual recall), and present evidence for its prevalence in practice. In the context of factual recall, we further show a link to rank-1 fact editing, providing a mechanistic explanation for previous work observing an inconsistency between fact editing performance and fact localization. However, this does not imply that activation patching of subspaces is intrinsically unfit for interpretability. To contextualize our findings, we also show what a success case looks like in a task (indirect object identification) where prior manual circuit analysis informs an understanding of the location of a feature. We explore the additional evidence needed to argue that a patched subspace is faithful",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Subject-verb agreement in the presence of an attractor noun located between the main noun and the verb elicits complex behavior: judgments of grammaticality are modulated by the grammatical features of the attractor. For example, in the sentence \"The girl near the boys likes climbing\", the attractor (boys) disagrees in grammatical number with the verb (likes), creating a locally implausible transition probability. Here, we parametrically modulate the distance between the attractor and the verb while keeping the length of the sentence equal. We evaluate the performance of both humans and two artificial neural network models: both make more mistakes when the attractor is closer to the verb, but neural networks get close to the chance level while humans are mostly able to overcome the attractor interference. Additionally, we report a linear effect of attractor distance on reaction times. We hypothesize that a possible reason for the proximity effect is the calculation of transition probabilities between adjacent words. Nevertheless, classical models of attraction such as the cue-based model might suffice to explain this phenomenon, thus paving the way for new research.

This paper explores the potential of transfer learning in natural language processing focusing mainly on sentiment analysis. The models trained on the big data can also be used where data are scarce. The claim is that, compared to training models from scratch, transfer learning, using pre-trained BERT models, can increase sentiment classification accuracy. The study adopts a sophisticated experimental design that uses the IMDb dataset of sentimentally labelled movie reviews. Pre-processing includes tokenization and encoding of text data, making it suitable for NLP models. The dataset is used on a BERT based model, measuring its performance using accuracy. The result comes out to be 100 per cent accurate. Although the complete accuracy could appear impressive, it might be the result of overfitting or a lack of generalization. Further analysis is required to ensure the model's ability to handle diverse and unseen data.

Robust predictive features contain diverse information that helps a model generalize to out-of-distribution data. Hence, minimizing the information content of features obtained from a pretrained biased model helps learn the simplest predictive features that capture the underlying data distribution. We treat these features as confounder representations and use them via methods motivated by causal theory to remove bias from models. We find that the learned confounder representations indeed capture dataset biases, and the proposed debiasing methods improve out-of-distribution (OOD) performance on multiple multimodal datasets without sacrificing in-distribution performance. Additionally, we introduce a novel metric to quantify the sufficiency of spurious features in models' predictions that further demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced considerably, intertwining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content that is not only coherent but also contextually attuned. Despite their success, LVLMs still suffer from the issue of object hallucinations, where models generate plausible yet incorrect outputs that include objects that do not exist in the images. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD), a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors, two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Our experiments show that VCD, without either additional training or the usage of external tools, significantly mitigates the object hallucination issue across different LVLM families. Beyond mitigating object hallucinations, VCD also excels in general LVLM benchmarks, highlighting its wide-ranging applicability",

    "abstract": "Image editing affords increased control over the aesthetics and content of generated images. Pre-existing works focus predominantly on text-based instructions to achieve desired image modifications, which limit edit precision and accuracy. In this work, we propose an inference-time editing optimisation, designed to extend beyond textual edits to accommodate multiple editing instruction types (e.g. spatial layout-based; pose, scribbles, edge maps). We propose to disentangle the editing task into two competing subtasks: successful local image modifications and global content consistency preservation, where subtasks are guided through two dedicated loss functions. By allowing to adjust the influence of each loss function, we build a flexible editing solution that can be adjusted to user preferences. We evaluate our method using text, pose and scribble edit conditions, and highlight our ability to achieve complex edits, through both qualitative and quantitative experiments",

We report detailed evaluations, as well as a deep dive into the methods and custom tooling employed to pretrain Falcon. Notably, we report on our custom distributed training codebase, allowing us to efficiently pretrain these models on up to 4,096 A100s on cloud AWS infrastructure with limited interconnect.

In this work, we evaluate how robust metrics are to non-standardized dialects, i.e. spelling differences in language varieties that do not have a standard orthography. To investigate this, we collect a dataset of human translations and human judgments for automatic machine translations from English to two Swiss German dialects. We further create a challenge set for dialect variation and benchmark existing metrics' performances. Our results show that existing metrics cannot reliably evaluate Swiss German text generation outputs, especially on segment level.

To tackle this challenge, we propose an interactive system that helps users obtain insights into the reliability of the generated text.

Using this idea, we design RELIC, an interactive system that enables users to investigate and verify semantic-level variations in multiple long-form responses. This allows users to recognize potentially inaccurate information in the generated text and make necessary corrections. From a user study with ten participants, we demonstrate that our approach helps users better verify the reliability of the generated text.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models have made significant advancements in recent years, yet they still suffer from a common issue known as the \"hallucination problem\" where the models generate textual descriptions that contain inaccurate or non-existent content from the image. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel strategy: Hallucination-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (HA-DPO). Our approach treats the hallucination problem as a unique preference selection issue, where the model is trained to favor the non-hallucinating response when presented with two responses of the same image (one accurate and one hallucinating). This paper also presents an efficient process for constructing hallucination sample pairs to ensure high-quality, style-consistent pairs for stable HA-DPO training. We applied this strategy to two mainstream multimodal models, and the results showed a significant reduction in the hallucination problem and an enhancement in the models' generalization capabilities. With HA-DPO, the MiniGPT-4 model demonstrates significant advancements: POPE accuracy increases from 51.13% to 85.66% (34.5% absolute improvement), and the MME score escalates from 968.58 to 1365.76 (41% relative improvement).

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generative models have shown remarkable capabilities in producing diverse and imaginative visuals based on text prompts. Despite the advancement, these diffusion models sometimes struggle to translate the semantic content from the text into images entirely. While conditioning on the layout has shown to be effective in improving the compositional ability of T2I diffusion models, they typically require manual layout input. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to improving T2I diffusion models using Large Language Models (LLMs) as layout generators. Our method leverages the Chain-of-Thought prompting of LLMs to interpret text and generate spatially reasonable object layouts. The generated layout is then used to enhance the generated images' composition and spatial accuracy. Moreover, we propose an efficient adapter based on a cross-attention mechanism, which explicitly integrates the layout information into the stable diffusion models. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in image quality and layout accuracy, showcasing the potential of LLMs in augmenting generative image models",

Those LLMs can be used to generate large amounts of content which is posted on the internet to various platforms. As LLMs are trained on datasets usually collected from the internet, this LLM-generated content might be used to train the next generation of LLMs. Therefore, a self-consuming training loop emerges in which new LLM generations are trained on the output from the previous generations. We empirically study this self-consuming training loop using a novel dataset to analytically and accurately measure quality and diversity of generated outputs. We find that this self-consuming training loop initially improves both quality and diversity. However, after a few generations the output inevitably degenerates in diversity.

The solution revolves around the use of a neural network, based on the siamese architecture, to create the distributions of the distances between similar and dissimilar pairs of sentences. The goal of these distributions is to find a discriminating factor, that we call \"threshold\", which represents a well-defined quantity that can be used to distinguish vector distances of similar pairs from vector distances of dissimilar pairs in new predictions and later analyses. In addition, we developed a way to score the predictions by combining attributes from both the distributions' features and the way the distance function works. Finally, we generalize the results showing that they can be transferred to a wider range of domains by applying the system discussed to a well-known and widely used benchmark dataset for STS problems",

Correlations are also substantial within party, indicating that position estimates produced with GPT-4 capture within-party differences between senators. Overall, using GPT-4 for ideological scaling is fast, cost-efficient, and reliable. This approach provides a viable alternative to scaling by both expert raters and crowdsourcing",

    "title": "On the Long Range Abilities of Transformers",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite their dominance in modern DL and, especially, NLP domains, transformer architectures exhibit sub-optimal performance on long-range tasks compared to recent layers that are specifically designed for this purpose. In this work, drawing inspiration from key attributes of long-range layers, such as state-space layers, linear RNN layers, and global convolution layers, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the transformer architecture can significantly enhance performance on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, thus narrowing the gap with these specialized layers. We identify that two key principles for long-range tasks are (i) incorporating an inductive bias towards smoothness, and (ii) locality. As we show, integrating these ideas into the attention mechanism improves results with a negligible amount of additional computation and without any additional trainable parameters. Our theory and experiments also shed light on the reasons for the inferior performance of transformers on long-range tasks and identify critical properties that are essential for successfully capturing long-range dependencies",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The study of causal relationships between emotions and causes in texts has recently received much attention. Most works focus on extracting causally related clauses from documents. However, none of these works has considered that the causal relationships among the extracted emotion and cause clauses can only be valid under some specific context clauses. To highlight the context in such special causal relationships, we propose a new task to determine whether or not an input pair of emotion and cause has a valid causal relationship under different contexts and extract the specific context clauses that participate in the causal relationship. Since the task is new for which no existing dataset is available, we conduct manual annotation on a benchmark dataset to obtain the labels for our tasks and the annotations of each context clause's type that can also be used in some other applications. We adopt negative sampling to construct the final dataset to balance the number of documents with and without causal relationships. Based on the constructed dataset, we propose an end-to-end multi-task framework, where we design two novel and general modules to handle the two goals of our task. Specifically, we propose a context masking module to extract the context clauses participating in the causal relationships. We propose a prediction aggregation module to fine-tune the prediction results according to whether the input emotion and causes depend on specific context clauses. Results of extensive comparative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our proposed framework",

To validate the effectiveness of this GNN in extracting node features, a correlation analysis of the output features from each node within the neural network layer was conducted. The results from experiments show that this method can accurately locate fault nodes in simulated scenarios with a remarkable 99.53% accuracy.

As a first step towards an end-to-end method for generating speaking-style prompts from speech, i.e., automatic speaking-style captioning, StyleCap uses paired data of speech and natural language descriptions to train neural networks that predict prefix vectors fed into a large language model (LLM)-based text decoder from a speech representation vector. We explore an appropriate text decoder and speech feature representation suitable for this new task. The experimental results demonstrate that our StyleCap leveraging richer LLMs for the text decoder, speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and sentence rephrasing augmentation improves the accuracy and diversity of generated speaking-style captions.

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) are reshaping various aspects of human life, our current understanding of their impacts remains somewhat constrained. Here we investigate the impact of LLMs on human communication, in the context of consumer complaints in the financial industry. Employing an AI detection tool on more than 780K complaints gathered by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), we find evidence of LLM usage in the writing of complaints - shortly after the release of ChatGPT. Our analyses reveal that LLM usage is positively correlated with the likelihood of obtaining desirable outcomes (i.e., offer of relief from financial firms) and suggest that this positive correlation may be partly due to the linguistic features improved by LLMs. We test this conjecture with a preregistered experiment, which reveals results consistent with those from observational studies: Consumer complaints written with ChatGPT for improved linguistic qualities were more likely to receive hypothetical relief offers than the original consumer complaints, demonstrating the LLM's ability to enhance message persuasiveness in human communication. Being some of the earliest empirical evidence on LLM usage for enhancing persuasion, our results highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in human communication",

    "title": "Can Generalist Foundation Models Outcompete Special-Purpose Tuning? Case Study in Medicine",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Generalist foundation models such as GPT-4 have displayed surprising capabilities in a wide variety of domains and tasks. Yet, there is a prevalent assumption that they cannot match specialist capabilities of fine-tuned models. For example, most explorations to date on medical competency benchmarks have leveraged domain-specific training, as exemplified by efforts on BioGPT and Med-PaLM. We build on a prior study of GPT-4's capabilities on medical challenge benchmarks in the absence of special training. Rather than using simple prompting to highlight the model's out-of-the-box capabilities, we perform a systematic exploration of prompt engineering. We find that prompting innovation can unlock deeper specialist capabilities and show that GPT-4 easily tops prior leading results for medical benchmarks. The prompting methods we explore are general purpose, and make no specific use of domain expertise, removing the need for expert-curated content. Our experimental design carefully controls for overfitting during the prompt engineering process. We introduce Medprompt, based on a composition of several prompting strategies. With Medprompt, GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art results on all nine of the benchmark datasets in the MultiMedQA suite. The method outperforms leading specialist models such as Med-PaLM 2 by a significant margin with an order of magnitude fewer calls to the model. Steering GPT-4 with Medprompt achieves a 27% reduction in error rate on the MedQA dataset over the best methods to date achieved with specialist models and surpasses a score of 90% for the first time. Beyond medical problems, we show the power of Medprompt to generalize to other domains and provide evidence for the broad applicability of the approach via studies of the strategy on exams in electrical engineering, machine learning, philosophy, accounting, law, nursing, and clinical psychology",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel benchmark for cross-view knowledge transfer of dense video captioning, adapting models from web instructional videos with exocentric views to an egocentric view. While dense video captioning (predicting time segments and their captions) is primarily studied with exocentric videos (e.g., YouCook2), benchmarks with egocentric videos are restricted due to data scarcity. To overcome the limited video availability, transferring knowledge from abundant exocentric web videos is demanded as a practical approach. However, learning the correspondence between exocentric and egocentric views is difficult due to their dynamic view changes. The web videos contain mixed views focusing on either human body actions or close-up hand-object interactions, while the egocentric view is constantly shifting as the camera wearer moves. This necessitates the in-depth study of cross-view transfer under complex view changes. In this work, we first create a real-life egocentric dataset (EgoYC2) whose captions are shared with YouCook2, enabling transfer learning between these datasets assuming their ground-truth is accessible. To bridge the view gaps, we propose a view-invariant learning method using adversarial training in both the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. While the pre-training is designed to learn invariant features against the mixed views in the web videos, the view-invariant fine-tuning further mitigates the view gaps between both datasets. We validate our proposed method by studying how effectively it overcomes the view change problem and efficiently transfers the knowledge to the egocentric domain. Our benchmark pushes the study of the cross-view transfer into a new task domain of dense video captioning and will envision methodologies to describe egocentric videos in natural language",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models are well-known for their ability to generate realistic images based on textual prompts. However, the existing works have predominantly focused on English, lacking support for non-English text-to-image models. The most commonly used translation methods cannot solve the generation problem related to language culture, while training from scratch on a specific language dataset is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we are inspired to propose a simple plug-and-play language transfer method based on knowledge distillation. All we need to do is train a lightweight MLP-like parameter-efficient adapter (PEA) with only 6M parameters under teacher knowledge distillation along with a small parallel data corpus. We are surprised to find that freezing the parameters of UNet can still achieve remarkable performance on the language-specific prompt evaluation set, demonstrating that PEA can stimulate the potential generation ability of the original UNet. Additionally, it closely approaches the performance of the English text-to-image model on a general prompt evaluation set. Furthermore, our adapter can be used as a plugin to achieve significant results in downstream tasks in cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

    "abstract": "As the scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has dramatically enhanced their capabilities, there has been a growing focus on the alignment problem to ensure their responsible and ethical use. While existing alignment efforts predominantly concentrate on universal values such as the HHH principle, the aspect of culture, which is inherently pluralistic and diverse, has not received adequate attention. This work introduces a new benchmark, CDEval, aimed at evaluating the cultural dimensions of LLMs. CDEval is constructed by incorporating both GPT-4's automated generation and human verification, covering six cultural dimensions across seven domains. Our comprehensive experiments provide intriguing insights into the culture of mainstream LLMs, highlighting both consistencies and variations across different dimensions and domains. The findings underscore the importance of integrating cultural considerations in LLM development, particularly for applications in diverse cultural settings. Through CDEval, we aim to broaden the horizon of LLM alignment research by including cultural dimensions, thus providing a more holistic framework for the future development and evaluation of LLMs. This benchmark serves as a valuable resource for cultural studies in LLMs, paving the way for more culturally aware and sensitive models",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural methods have led to substantial improvement in the quality of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems. However, these systems frequently produce translations with inaccurate gender (Stanovsky et al., 2019), which can be traced to bias in training data. Saunders and Byrne (2020) tackle this problem with a handcrafted dataset containing balanced gendered profession words. By using this data to fine-tune an existing NMT model, they show that gender bias can be significantly mitigated, albeit at the expense of translation quality due to catastrophic forgetting. They recover some of the lost quality with modified training objectives or additional models at inference. We find, however, that simply supplementing the handcrafted dataset with a random sample from the base model training corpus is enough to significantly reduce the catastrophic forgetting. We also propose a novel domain-adaptation technique that leverages in-domain data created with the counterfactual data generation techniques proposed by Zmigrod et al. (2019) to further improve accuracy on the WinoMT challenge test set without significant loss in translation quality. We show its effectiveness in NMT systems from English into three morphologically rich languages French, Spanish, and Italian. The relevant dataset and code will be available at Github",

    "abstract": "The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However, recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning, such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)--a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet, scene graph data requires scene graph annotations, which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover, finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this, inspired by chain-of-thought methods, we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT), a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically, we first generate an SG using the LMM, and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments, we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks, without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs",

    "abstract": "Modern ML systems ingest data aggregated from diverse sources, such as synthetic, human-annotated, and live customer traffic. Understanding \\textit{which} examples are important to the performance of a learning algorithm is crucial for efficient model training. Recently, a growing body of literature has given rise to various \"influence scores,\" which use training artifacts such as model confidence or checkpointed gradients to identify important subsets of data. However, these methods have primarily been developed in computer vision settings, and it remains unclear how well they generalize to language-based tasks using pretrained models. In this paper, we explore the applicability of influence scores in language classification tasks. We evaluate a diverse subset of these scores on the SNLI dataset by quantifying accuracy changes in response to pruning training data through random and influence-score-based sampling. We then stress-test one of the scores -- \"variance of gradients\" (VoG) from Agarwal et al. (2022) -- in an NLU model stack that was exposed to dynamic user speech patterns in a voice assistant type of setting. Our experiments demonstrate that in many cases, encoder-based language models can be finetuned on roughly 50% of the original data without degradation in performance metrics. Along the way, we summarize lessons learned from applying out-of-the-box implementations of influence scores, quantify the effects of noisy and class-imbalanced data, and offer recommendations on score-based sampling for better accuracy and training efficiency",

Our generalized left-corner transformation (GLCT) arose from unifying the left-corner transformation and speculation transformation (Eisner and Blatz, 2007), originally for logic programming. Our new transformation and speculation define equivalent weighted languages. Yet, their derivation trees are structurally different in an important way: GLCT replaces left recursion with right recursion, and speculation does not. We also provide several technical results regarding the formal relationships between the outputs of GLCT, speculation, and the original grammar. Lastly, we empirically investigate the efficiency of GLCT for left-recursion elimination from grammars of nine languages",

    "title": "Removing NSFW Concepts from Vision-and-Language Models for Text-to-Image Retrieval and Generation",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness across a wide range of tasks. However, these models are typically trained on web-scale data, which can introduce inappropriate content and lead to the development of unsafe and biased behavior. This, in turn, hampers their applicability in sensitive and trustworthy contexts and could raise significant concern in their adoption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a methodology to make Vision-and-Language models safer by removing their sensitivity to not-safe-for-work concepts. We show how this can be done by distilling from a large language model which converts between safe and unsafe sentences and which is fine-tuned starting from just 100 manually-curated pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on the resulting embedding space for both retrieval and text-to-image generation, where we show that our model can also be properly employed with pre-trained image generators.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This work focuses on the potential of Vision LLMs (VLLMs) in visual reasoning. Different from prior studies, we shift our focus from evaluating standard performance to introducing a comprehensive safety evaluation suite, covering both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and adversarial robustness. For the OOD evaluation, we present two novel VQA datasets, each with one variant, designed to test model performance under challenging conditions. In exploring adversarial robustness, we propose a straightforward attack strategy for misleading VLLMs to produce visual-unrelated responses. Moreover, we assess the efficacy of two jailbreaking strategies, targeting either the vision or language component of VLLMs. Our evaluation of 21 diverse models, ranging from open-source VLLMs to GPT-4V, yields interesting observations: 1) Current VLLMs struggle with OOD texts but not images, unless the visual information is limited; and 2) These VLLMs can be easily misled by deceiving vision encoders only, and their vision-language training often compromise safety protocols. We release this safety evaluation suite at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/vllm-safety-benchmark",

    "abstract": "Even the most advanced language models remain susceptible to errors necessitating to modify these models without initiating a comprehensive retraining process. Model editing refers to the modification of a model's knowledge or representations in a manner that produces the desired outcomes. Prior research primarily centered around editing factual data e.g. \"Messi plays for Inter Miami\" confining the definition of an edit to a knowledge triplet i.e. (subject, object, relation). However, as the applications of language models expand, so do the diverse ways in which we wish to edit and refine their outputs. In this study, we broaden the scope of the editing problem to include an array of editing cases such as debiasing and rectifying reasoning errors and define an edit as any natural language expression that solicits a change in the model's outputs. We are introducing DUnE-an editing benchmark where edits are natural language sentences and propose that DUnE presents a challenging yet relevant task. To substantiate this claim, we conduct an extensive series of experiments testing various editing approaches to address DUnE, demonstrating their respective strengths and weaknesses. We show that retrieval-augmented language modeling can outperform specialized editing techniques and neither set of approaches has fully solved the generalized editing problem covered by our benchmark",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While performance of many text classification tasks has been recently improved due to Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), in this paper we show that they still suffer from a performance gap when the underlying distribution of topics changes. For example, a genre classifier trained on \\textit{political} topics often fails when tested on documents about \\textit{sport} or \\textit{medicine}. In this work, we quantify this phenomenon empirically with a large corpus and a large set of topics. Consequently, we verify that domain transfer remains challenging both for classic PLMs, such as BERT, and for modern large models, such as GPT-3. We also suggest and successfully test a possible remedy: after augmenting the training dataset with topically-controlled synthetic texts, the F1 score improves by up to 50\\% for some topics, nearing on-topic training results, while others show little to no improvement. While our empirical results focus on genre classification, our methodology is applicable to other classification tasks such as gender, authorship, or sentiment classification.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can potentially democratize access to medical knowledge. While many efforts have been made to harness and improve LLMs' medical knowledge and reasoning capacities, the resulting models are either closed-source (e.g., PaLM, GPT-4) or limited in scale (<= 13B parameters), which restricts their abilities. In this work, we improve access to large-scale medical LLMs by releasing MEDITRON: a suite of open-source LLMs with 7B and 70B parameters adapted to the medical domain. MEDITRON builds on Llama-2 (through our adaptation of Nvidia's Megatron-LM distributed trainer), and extends pretraining on a comprehensively curated medical corpus, including selected PubMed articles, abstracts, and internationally-recognized medical guidelines. Evaluations using four major medical benchmarks show significant performance gains over several state-of-the-art baselines before and after task-specific finetuning. Overall, MEDITRON achieves a 6% absolute performance gain over the best public baseline in its parameter class and 3% over the strongest baseline we finetuned from Llama-2. Compared to closed-source LLMs, MEDITRON-70B outperforms GPT-3.5 and Med-PaLM and is within 5% of GPT-4 and 10% of Med-PaLM-2. We release our code for curating the medical pretraining corpus and the MEDITRON model weights to drive open-source development of more capable medical LLMs",

Drawing on the wealth of the UMLS knowledge graph and harnessing cutting-edge Large Language Models, we propose a new state-of-the-art approach for obtaining high-fidelity representations of biomedical concepts and sentences, consisting of three steps: an improved contrastive learning phase, a novel self-distillation phase, and a weight averaging phase. Through rigorous evaluations via the extensive BioLORD testing suite and diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate consistent and substantial performance improvements over the previous state of the art (e.g. +2pts on MedSTS, +2.5pts on MedNLI-S, +6.1pts on EHR-Rel-B). Besides our new state-of-the-art biomedical model for English, we also distill and release a multilingual model compatible with 50+ languages and finetuned on 7 European languages. Many clinical pipelines can benefit from our latest models. Our new multilingual model enables a range of languages to benefit from our advancements in biomedical semantic representation learning, opening a new avenue for bioinformatics researchers around the world.

    "abstract": "Among the many tasks that Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized is text classification. However, existing approaches for applying pretrained LLMs to text classification predominantly rely on using single token outputs from only the last layer of hidden states. As a result, they suffer from limitations in efficiency, task-specificity, and interpretability. In our work, we contribute an approach that uses all internal representations by employing multiple pooling strategies on all activation and hidden states. Our novel lightweight strategy, Sparsify-then-Classify (STC) first sparsifies task-specific features layer-by-layer, then aggregates across layers for text classification. STC can be applied as a seamless plug-and-play module on top of existing LLMs. Our experiments on a comprehensive set of models and datasets demonstrate that STC not only consistently improves the classification performance of pretrained and fine-tuned models, but is also more efficient for both training and inference, and is more intrinsically interpretable",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Procedural videos show step-by-step demonstrations of tasks like recipe preparation. Understanding such videos is challenging, involving the precise localization of steps and the generation of textual instructions. Manually annotating steps and writing instructions is costly, which limits the size of current datasets and hinders effective learning. Leveraging large but noisy video-transcript datasets for pre-training can boost performance, but demands significant computational resources. Furthermore, transcripts contain irrelevant content and exhibit style variation compared to instructions written by human annotators. To mitigate both issues, we propose a technique, Sieve-&-Swap, to automatically curate a smaller dataset: (i) Sieve filters irrelevant transcripts and (ii) Swap enhances the quality of the text instruction by automatically replacing the transcripts with human-written instructions from a text-only recipe dataset. The curated dataset, three orders of magnitude smaller than current web-scale datasets, enables efficient training of large-scale models with competitive performance. We complement our Sieve-\\&-Swap approach with a Procedure Transformer (ProcX) for end-to-end step localization and instruction generation for procedural videos. When this model is pre-trained on our curated dataset, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot and finetuning settings on YouCook2 and Tasty, while using a fraction of the computational resources",

We develop a novel metric, the Phonetic-Syntax Ratio (PSR), to measure the phonetic and synthetic information in the extracted representations using deep generalized canonical correlation analysis. Results show the contrastive loss in the wav2vec2.0 objective facilitates more effective cross-lingual feature extraction. There is a positive correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance, suggesting that phonetic information extracted by monolingual SSL models can be used for downstream tasks in cross-lingual settings.

We introduce the first public annotated dataset specifically on the Mobility domain of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), aiming to facilitate automatic extraction and analysis of functioning information from free-text clinical notes. We utilize the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) research dataset to construct a pool of candidate sentences using keyword expansion. Our active learning approach, using query-by-committee sampling weighted by density representativeness, selects informative sentences for human annotation. We train BERT and CRF models, and use predictions from these models to guide the selection of new sentences for subsequent annotation iterations. Our final dataset consists of 4,265 sentences with a total of 11,784 entities, including 5,511 Action entities, 5,328 Mobility entities, 306 Assistance entities, and 639 Quantification entities. The inter-annotator agreement (IAA), averaged over all entity types, is 0.72 for exact matching and 0.91 for partial matching. We also train and evaluate common BERT models and state-of-the-art Nested NER models. The best F1 scores are 0.84 for Action, 0.7 for Mobility, 0.62 for Assistance, and 0.71 for Quantification.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to post-Optical Character Recognition Correction (POC) for handwritten Cyrillic text, addressing a significant gap in current research methodologies. This gap is due to the lack of large text corporas that provide OCR errors for further training of language-based POC models, which are demanding in terms of corpora size. Our study primarily focuses on the development and application of a synthetic handwriting generation engine based on B\\'ezier curves. Such an engine generates highly realistic handwritten text in any amounts, which we utilize to create a substantial dataset by transforming Russian text corpora sourced from the internet. We apply a Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model to this dataset to identify OCR errors, forming the basis for our POC model training. The correction model is trained on a 90-symbol input context, utilizing a pre-trained T5 architecture with a seq2seq correction task. We evaluate our approach on HWR200 and School_notebooks_RU datasets as they provide significant challenges in the HTR domain. Furthermore, POC can be used to highlight errors for teachers, evaluating student performance. This can be done simply by comparing sentences before and after correction, displaying differences in text. Our primary contribution lies in the innovative use of B\\'ezier curves for Cyrillic text generation and subsequent error correction using a specialized POC model. We validate our approach by presenting Word Accuracy Rate (WAR) and Character Accuracy Rate (CAR) results, both with and without post-OCR correction, using real open corporas of handwritten Cyrillic text. These results, coupled with our methodology, are designed to be reproducible, paving the way for further advancements in the field of OCR and handwritten text analysis.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent work in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision has been using textual information -- e.g., entity names and descriptions -- available in knowledge graphs to ground neural models to high-quality structured data. However, when it comes to non-English languages, the quantity and quality of textual information are comparatively scarce. To address this issue, we introduce the novel task of automatic Knowledge Graph Enhancement (KGE) and perform a thorough investigation on bridging the gap in both the quantity and quality of textual information between English and non-English languages. More specifically, we: i) bring to light the problem of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of entity names and descriptions in Wikidata; ii) demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods, namely, Machine Translation (MT), Web Search (WS), and Large Language Models (LLMs), struggle with this task; iii) present M-NTA, a novel unsupervised approach that combines MT, WS, and LLMs to generate high-quality textual information; and, iv) study the impact of increasing multilingual coverage and precision of non-English textual information in Entity Linking, Knowledge Graph Completion, and Question Answering. As part of our effort towards better multilingual knowledge graphs, we also introduce WikiKGE-10, the first human-curated benchmark to evaluate KGE approaches in 10 languages across 7 language families",

    "title": "Knowledge Unlearning for LLMs: Tasks, Methods, and Challenges",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have spurred a new research paradigm in natural language processing. Despite their excellent capability in knowledge-based question answering and reasoning, their potential to retain faulty or even harmful knowledge poses risks of malicious application. The challenge of mitigating this issue and transforming these models into purer assistants is crucial for their widespread applicability. Unfortunately, Retraining LLMs repeatedly to eliminate undesirable knowledge is impractical due to their immense parameters. Knowledge unlearning, derived from analogous studies on machine unlearning, presents a promising avenue to address this concern and is notably advantageous in the context of LLMs. It allows for the removal of harmful knowledge in an efficient manner, without affecting unrelated knowledge in the model. To this end, we provide a survey of knowledge unlearning in the era of LLMs. Firstly, we formally define the knowledge unlearning problem and distinguish it from related works. Subsequently, we categorize existing knowledge unlearning methods into three classes: those based on parameter optimization, parameter merging, and in-context learning, and introduce details of these unlearning methods. We further present evaluation datasets used in existing methods, and finally conclude this survey by presenting the ongoing challenges and future directions",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved significant multimodal generation capabilities, akin to GPT-4. These models predominantly map visual information into language representation space, leveraging the vast knowledge and powerful text generation abilities of LLMs to produce multimodal instruction-following responses. We could term this method as LLMs for Vision because of its employing LLMs for visual-language understanding, yet observe that these MLLMs neglect the potential of harnessing visual knowledge to enhance overall capabilities of LLMs, which could be regraded as Vision Enhancing LLMs. In this paper, we propose an approach called MKS2, aimed at enhancing LLMs through empowering Multimodal Knowledge Storage and Sharing in LLMs. Specifically, we introduce the Modular Visual Memory, a component integrated into the internal blocks of LLMs, designed to store open-world visual information efficiently. Additionally, we present a soft Mixtures-of-Multimodal Experts architecture in LLMs to invoke multimodal knowledge collaboration during generation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MKS2 substantially augments the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in contexts necessitating physical or commonsense knowledge.

Creating high-quality educational crosswords can be challenging, but recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning have made it possible to use language models to generate nice wordplays. The exploitation of cutting-edge language models like GPT3-DaVinci, GPT3-Curie, GPT3-Babbage, GPT3-Ada, and BERT-uncased has led to the development of a comprehensive system for generating and verifying crossword clues. A large dataset of clue-answer pairs was compiled to fine-tune the models in a supervised manner to generate original and challenging clues from a given keyword. On the other hand, for generating crossword clues from a given text, Zero/Few-shot learning techniques were used to extract clues from the input text, adding variety and creativity to the puzzles. We employed the fine-tuned model to generate data and labeled the acceptability of clue-answer parts with human supervision. To ensure quality, we developed a classifier by fine-tuning existing language models on the labeled dataset. Conversely, to assess the quality of clues generated from the given text using zero/few-shot learning, we employed a zero-shot learning approach to check the quality of generated clues. The results of the evaluation have been very promising, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in creating high-standard educational crosswords that offer students engaging and rewarding learning experiences",

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has become the de facto method to equip large language models (LLMs) with the ability of following user instructions. Usually, hundreds of thousands or millions of instruction-following pairs are employed to fine-tune the foundation LLMs. Recently, some studies show that a small number of high-quality instruction data is enough. However, how to select appropriate instruction data for a given LLM is still an open problem. To address this problem, in this paper we present a model-oriented data selection (MoDS) approach, which selects instruction data based on a new criteria considering three aspects: quality, coverage and necessity. First, our approach utilizes a quality evaluation model to filter out the high-quality subset from the original instruction dataset, and then designs an algorithm to further select from the high-quality subset a seed instruction dataset with good coverage. The seed dataset is applied to fine-tune the foundation LLM to obtain an initial instruction-following LLM. Finally, we develop a necessity evaluation model to find out the instruction data which are performed badly in the initial instruction-following LLM and consider them necessary instructions to further improve the LLMs. In this way, we can get a small high-quality, broad-coverage and high-necessity subset from the original instruction datasets. Experimental results show that, the model fine-tuned with 4,000 instruction pairs selected by our approach could perform better than the model fine-tuned with the full original dataset which includes 214k instruction data",

This employs Q-learning (with standard Q*) for generation and follows a semantic-rewarded trajectory for image search through finite encoding-tailored actions. The second proposed method, noisy diffusion gradient, is optimization driven. At the root of both methods is a special CFG encoding that we propose for continual semantic guidance.

Traditional traffic prediction methods rely only on historical traffic data to predict traffic trends and face two main challenges. 1) insensitivity to unusual events. 2) poor performance in long-term prediction. In this work, we explore how generative models combined with text describing the traffic system can be applied for traffic generation and name the task Text-to-Traffic Generation (TTG). The key challenge of the TTG task is how to associate text with the spatial structure of the road network and traffic data for generating traffic situations. To this end, we propose ChatTraffic, the first diffusion model for text-to-traffic generation. To guarantee the consistency between synthetic and real data, we augment a diffusion model with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to extract spatial correlations of traffic data. In addition, we construct a large dataset containing text-traffic pairs for the TTG task. We benchmarked our model qualitatively and quantitatively on the released dataset. The experimental results indicate that ChatTraffic can generate realistic traffic situations from the text. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ChyaZhang/ChatTraffic",

While copious solutions, such as active learning for small language models (SLMs) and prevalent in-context learning in the era of large language models (LLMs), have been proposed and alleviate the labeling burden to some extent, their performances are still subject to human intervention. It is still underexplored how to reduce the annotation cost in the LLMs era. To bridge this, we revolutionize traditional active learning and propose an innovative collaborative learning framework FreeAL to interactively distill and filter the task-specific knowledge from LLMs. During collaborative training, an LLM serves as an active annotator inculcating its coarse-grained knowledge, while a downstream SLM is incurred as a student to filter out high-quality in-context samples to feedback LLM for the subsequent label refinery. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreeAL largely enhances the zero-shot performances for both SLM and LLM without any human supervision.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown promising results in traditional downstream tasks. Evaluation studies have emerged to assess their abilities, with the majority focusing on the third-person perspective, and only a few addressing specific tasks from the first-person perspective. However, the capability of VLMs to \"think\" from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate eighteen popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics",

We provide a two-fold explanation by analyzing tokens from each modality. First, we demonstrate that image tokens possess significantly different semantics compared to text tokens, rendering pre-trained language models no more effective in modeling them than randomly initialized ones. Second, the text tokens in the image-text datasets are too simple compared to normal language model pre-training data, which causes the catastrophic degradation of language models' capability",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The high computational and memory requirements of generative large language models (LLMs) make it challenging to serve them cheaply. This paper aims to reduce the monetary cost for serving LLMs by leveraging preemptible GPU instances on modern clouds, which offer accesses to spare GPUs at a much cheaper price than regular instances but may be preempted by the cloud at any time. Serving LLMs on preemptible instances requires addressing challenges induced by frequent instance preemptions and the necessity of migrating instances to handle these preemptions. This paper presents SpotServe, the first distributed LLM serving system on preemptible instances. Several key techniques in SpotServe realize fast and reliable serving of generative LLMs on cheap preemptible instances. First, SpotServe dynamically adapts the LLM parallelization configuration for dynamic instance availability and fluctuating workload, while balancing the trade-off among the overall throughput, inference latency and monetary costs. Second, to minimize the cost of migrating instances for dynamic reparallelization, the task of migrating instances is formulated as a bipartite graph matching problem, which uses the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm to identify an optimal migration plan that minimizes communications. Finally, to take advantage of the grace period offered by modern clouds, we introduce stateful inference recovery, a new inference mechanism that commits inference progress at a much finer granularity and allows SpotServe to cheaply resume inference upon preemption. We evaluate on real spot instance preemption traces and various popular LLMs and show that SpotServe can reduce the P99 tail latency by 2.4 - 9.1x compared with the best existing LLM serving systems. We also show that SpotServe can leverage the price advantage of preemptive instances, saving 54% monetary cost compared with only using on-demand instances",

By iterating this loop, the two components mutually enhance one another's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our unsupervised $\\texttt{ABEL}$ model outperforms both leading supervised and unsupervised retrievers on the BEIR benchmark. Meanwhile, it exhibits strong adaptation abilities to tasks and domains that were unseen during training.

First, we empirically investigate LLM model's ability of explaining financial concepts and terminologies. Second, we assess LLM models' capacity of querying historical stock prices. Third, to alleviate the hallucination issue, we evaluate the efficacy of four practical methods, including few-shot learning, Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa), the Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) method and the prompt-based tool learning method for a function to generate a query command. Finally, our major finding is that off-the-shelf LLMs experience serious hallucination behaviors in financial tasks. Therefore, there is an urgent need to call for research efforts in mitigating LLMs' hallucination",

    "title": "The effect of source disclosure on evaluation of AI-generated messages: A two-part study",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last decade demonstrate that machines can exhibit communicative behavior and influence how humans think, feel, and behave. In fact, the recent development of ChatGPT has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to generate high-quality communication content at scale and across domains, suggesting that they will be increasingly used in practice. However, many questions remain about how knowing the source of the messages influences recipients' evaluation of and preference for AI-generated messages compared to human-generated messages. This paper investigated this topic in the context of vaping prevention messaging. In Study 1, which was pre-registered, we examined the influence of source disclosure on people's evaluation of AI-generated health prevention messages compared to human-generated messages. We found that source disclosure (i.e., labeling the source of a message as AI vs. human) significantly impacted the evaluation of the messages but did not significantly alter message rankings. In a follow-up study (Study 2), we examined how the influence of source disclosure may vary by the participants' negative attitudes towards AI. We found a significant moderating effect of negative attitudes towards AI on message evaluation, but not for message selection. However, for those with moderate levels of negative attitudes towards AI, source disclosure decreased the preference for AI-generated messages. Overall, the results of this series of studies showed a slight bias against AI-generated messages once the source was disclosed, adding to the emerging area of study that lies at the intersection of AI and communication",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Whole slide images are the foundation of digital pathology for the diagnosis and treatment of carcinomas. Writing pathology reports is laborious and error-prone for inexperienced pathologists. To reduce the workload and improve clinical automation, we investigate how to generate pathology reports given whole slide images. On the data end, we curated the largest WSI-text dataset (TCGA-PathoText). In specific, we collected nearly 10000 high-quality WSI-text pairs for visual-language models by recognizing and cleaning pathology reports which narrate diagnostic slides in TCGA. On the model end, we propose the multiple instance generative model (MI-Gen) which can produce pathology reports for gigapixel WSIs. We benchmark our model on the largest subset of TCGA-PathoText. Experimental results show our model can generate pathology reports which contain multiple clinical clues. Furthermore, WSI-text prediction can be seen as an approach of visual-language pre-training, which enables our model to be transferred to downstream diagnostic tasks like carcinoma grading and phenotyping. We observe that simple semantic extraction from the pathology reports can achieve the best performance (0.838 of F1 score) on BRCA subtyping without adding extra parameters or tricky fine-tuning. Our collected dataset and related code will all be publicly available",

This helps us to be able to answer new questions accurately as long as it is a relevant question. In commercial applications, it can be used to increase customer satisfaction and ease of usage.

Experimental results show that genre difference significantly impact NER performance though not as much as domain difference like literary domain and news domain.

We introduce a simple and scalable approach to resolve translation ambiguity by incorporating a small amount of extra-sentential context in neural \\mt.

Since actual document context is not available for the vast majority of \\mt training data, we collect related sentences for each input to construct pseudo-documents. Salient words from pseudo-documents are then encoded as a prefix to each source sentence to condition the generation of the translation. To evaluate, we release \\docmucow, a challenge set for translation disambiguation based on the English-German \\mucow \\cite{raganato-etal-2020-evaluation} augmented with document IDs.

    "abstract": "This work introduces (1) a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to leverage user-provided code when solving programming tasks and (2) a method to iteratively generate modular sub-functions that can aid future code generation attempts when the initial code generated by the LLM is inadequate. Generating computer programs in general-purpose programming languages like Python poses a challenge for LLMs when instructed to use code provided in the prompt. Code-specific LLMs (e.g., GitHub Copilot, CodeLlama2) can generate code completions in real-time by drawing on all code available in a development environment. However, restricting code-specific LLMs to use only in-context code is not straightforward, as the model is not explicitly instructed to use the user-provided code and users cannot highlight precisely which snippets of code the model should incorporate into its context. Moreover, current systems lack effective recovery methods, forcing users to iteratively re-prompt the model with modified prompts until a sufficient solution is reached. Our method differs from traditional LLM-powered code-generation by constraining code-generation to an explicit function set and enabling recovery from failed attempts through automatically generated sub-functions. When the LLM cannot produce working code, we generate modular sub-functions to aid subsequent attempts at generating functional code. A by-product of our method is a library of reusable sub-functions that can solve related tasks, imitating a software team where efficiency scales with experience. We also introduce a new \"half-shot\" evaluation paradigm that provides tighter estimates of LLMs' coding abilities compared to traditional zero-shot evaluation. Our proposed evaluation method encourages models to output solutions in a structured format, decreasing syntax errors that can be mistaken for poor coding ability",

It also aims to improve its performance and text generation quality for knowledge question-answering (QA) tasks. Based on the ChatGLM, we automatically generate QA datasets using urban renewal scientific literature corpora in a self-instruct manner and then conduct joint fine-tuning training on the model using the Prefix and LoRA fine-tuning methods to create an LLM for urban renewal. By guiding the LLM to automatically generate QA data based on prompt words and given text, it is possible to quickly obtain datasets in the urban renewal field and provide data support for the fine-tuning training of LLMs. The experimental results show that the joint fine-tuning training method proposed in this study can significantly improve the performance of LLM on the QA tasks. Compared with LoRA fine-tuning, the method improves the Bleu and Rouge metrics on the test by about 5%; compared with the model before fine-tuning, the method improves the Bleu and Rouge metrics by about 15%-20%. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the joint fine-tuning method using Prefix and LoRA for ChatGLM in the urban renewal knowledge QA tasks.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "There has recently been a sharp increase in interest in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC). Despite this, musical components such as time signatures have not been studied sufficiently to form an algorithmic determination approach for new compositions, especially lyrical songs. This is likely because of the neglect of musical details, which is critical for constructing a robust framework. Specifically, time signatures establish the fundamental rhythmic structure for almost all aspects of a song, including the phrases and notes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that only uses lyrics as input to automatically generate a fitting time signature for lyrical songs and uncover the latent rhythmic structure utilizing explainable machine learning models. In particular, we devise multiple methods that are associated with discovering lyrical patterns and creating new features that simultaneously contain lyrical, rhythmic, and statistical information. In this approach, the best of our experimental results reveal a 97.6% F1 score and a 0.996 Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) score. In conclusion, our research directly generates time signatures from lyrics automatically for new scores utilizing machine learning, which is an innovative idea that approaches an understudied component of musicology and therefore contributes significantly to the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI) music generation",

Different from conventional early stopping techniques where tokens can early exit at only early layers, we propose a more general method that dynamically skips the execution of a layer (or module) for any input token with a binary router.

Via multiple feed-forward layers, LSW learns to assign weights to each section of, and incorporate the weights in the prediction. We demonstrate our approach on scientific articles. Experimental results on public (arXiv) and private (Elsevier) datasets confirm the superiority of LSW, compared to state-of-the-art multi-label document classification methods.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal contributors in contemporary natural language processing and are increasingly being applied across a diverse range of industries. However, these large-scale probabilistic statistical models cannot currently ensure the requisite quality in professional content generation. These models often produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the authentic reliability of LLMs in text generation, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. Nevertheless, these benchmarks frequently utilize constrained generation techniques due to cost and temporal constraints. These techniques encompass the use of directed hallucination induction and strategies that deliberately alter authentic text to produce hallucinations. These approaches are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations in text generation is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also executed extensive experiments, evaluating prominent Chinese language models and the GPT series models to derive professional performance insights regarding hallucination challenges",

    "abstract": "Syntactic structures used to play a vital role in natural language processing (NLP), but since the deep learning revolution, NLP has been gradually dominated by neural models that do not consider syntactic structures in their design. One vastly successful class of neural models is transformers. When used as an encoder, a transformer produces contextual representation of words in the input sentence. In this work, we propose a new model of contextual word representation, not from a neural perspective, but from a purely syntactic and probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we design a conditional random field that models discrete latent representations of all words in a sentence as well as dependency arcs between them; and we use mean field variational inference for approximate inference. Strikingly, we find that the computation graph of our model resembles transformers, with correspondences between dependencies and self-attention and between distributions over latent representations and contextual embeddings of words. Experiments show that our model performs competitively to transformers on small to medium sized datasets. We hope that our work could help bridge the gap between traditional syntactic and probabilistic approaches and cutting-edge neural approaches to NLP, and inspire more linguistically-principled neural approaches in the future",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The impact of non-deterministic outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) is not well examined for financial text understanding tasks. Through a compelling case study on investing in the US equity market via news sentiment analysis, we uncover substantial variability in sentence-level sentiment classification results, underscoring the innate volatility of LLM outputs. These uncertainties cascade downstream, leading to more significant variations in portfolio construction and return. While tweaking the temperature parameter in the language model decoder presents a potential remedy, it comes at the expense of stifled creativity. Similarly, while ensembling multiple outputs mitigates the effect of volatile outputs, it demands a notable computational investment. This work furnishes practitioners with invaluable insights for adeptly navigating uncertainty in the integration of LLMs into financial decision-making, particularly in scenarios dictated by non-deterministic information",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant knowledge through their outputs, though it is often unclear whether false outputs are due to a lack of knowledge or dishonesty. In this paper, we investigate instructed dishonesty, wherein we explicitly prompt LLaMA-2-70b-chat to lie. We perform prompt engineering to find which prompts best induce lying behavior, and then use mechanistic interpretability approaches to localize where in the network this behavior occurs. Using linear probing and activation patching, we localize five layers that appear especially important for lying. We then find just 46 attention heads within these layers that enable us to causally intervene such that the lying model instead answers honestly. We show that these interventions work robustly across many prompts and dataset splits. Overall, our work contributes a greater understanding of dishonesty in LLMs so that we may hope to prevent it",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In a number of information retrieval applications (e.g., patent search, literature review, due diligence, etc.), preventing false negatives is more important than preventing false positives. However, approaches designed to reduce review effort (like \"technology assisted review\") can create false negatives, since they are often based on active learning systems that exclude documents automatically based on user feedback. Therefore, this research proposes a more recall-oriented approach to reducing review effort. More specifically, through iteratively re-ranking the relevance rankings based on user feedback, which is also referred to as relevance feedback. In our proposed method, the relevance rankings are produced by a BERT-based dense-vector search and the relevance feedback is based on cumulatively summing the queried and selected embeddings. Our results show that this method can reduce review effort between 17.85% and 59.04%, compared to a baseline approach (of no feedback), given a fixed recall target",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "As the immense opportunities enabled by large language models become more apparent, NLP systems will be increasingly expected to excel in real-world settings. However, in many instances, powerful models alone will not yield translational NLP solutions, especially if the formulated problem is not well aligned with the real-world task. In this work, we study the case of UMLS vocabulary insertion, an important real-world task in which hundreds of thousands of new terms, referred to as atoms, are added to the UMLS, one of the most comprehensive open-source biomedical knowledge bases. Previous work aimed to develop an automated NLP system to make this time-consuming, costly, and error-prone task more efficient. Nevertheless, practical progress in this direction has been difficult to achieve due to a problem formulation and evaluation gap between research output and the real-world task. In order to address this gap, we introduce a new formulation for UMLS vocabulary insertion which mirrors the real-world task, datasets which faithfully represent it and several strong baselines we developed through re-purposing existing solutions. Additionally, we propose an effective rule-enhanced biomedical language model which enables important new model behavior, outperforms all strong baselines and provides measurable qualitative improvements to editors who carry out the UVI task. We hope this case study provides insight into the considerable importance of problem formulation for the success of translational NLP solutions",

Such discrepancies can significantly affect the performance of machine learning algorithms. This study investigates the potential of identifying and addressing outliers in text data with subjective labels, aiming to enhance classification outcomes. We utilized the Deep SVDD algorithm, a one-class classification method, to detect outliers in nine text-based emotion and sentiment analysis datasets. By employing both a small-sized language model (DistilBERT base model with 66 million parameters) and non-deep learning machine learning algorithms (decision tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, and LDA) as the classifier, our findings suggest that the removal of outliers can lead to enhanced results in most cases. Additionally, as outliers in such datasets are not necessarily unlearnable, we experienced utilizing a large language model -- DeBERTa v3 large with 131 million parameters, which can capture very complex patterns in data. We continued to observe performance enhancements across multiple datasets",

Early identification and intervention are crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic, social, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an automated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is applied for the first time in Cypriot Greek children, which is generally considered underresearched in the context of DLD. The neural network model was trained using perceptual and production data elicited from children with DLD and healthy controls. The k-fold technique was used to crossvalidate the algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC/AUC curve to assess its ability to make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated high classification values for all metrics (between 0.92 and 0.98), indicating the high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD. Additionally, the variable importance analysis revealed that the language production skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance of the model compared to perception skills. Neural networks represent powerful tools for detecting DLD, providing early and quick assessments of the disorder, and having the potential to improve clinical outcomes",

Specifically, a multi-resolution emotion graph is devised to capture context-based emotion interactions from different resolutions, further modeling emotion correlation.

Further qualitative analysis highlights the existing limitations inherent in current LLMs when evaluating in high-risk domains. This underscores the essential nature of not only improving LLM capabilities but also prioritizing the refinement of domain-specific metrics, and embracing a more human-centric approach to enhance safety and factual reliability.

This paper proposes to generate diverse and high-quality paraphrases by exploiting the pre-trained models with instance-dependent prompts. To learn generalizable prompts, we assume that the number of abstract transforming patterns of paraphrase generation (governed by prompts) is finite and usually not large. Therefore, we present vector-quantized prompts as the cues to control the generation of pre-trained models.

We describe an algorithm for MBR which gradually grows the number of samples used to estimate the utility while pruning hypotheses that are unlikely to have the highest utility according to confidence estimates obtained with bootstrap sampling. Our method requires fewer samples and drastically reduces the number of calls to the utility function compared to standard MBR while being statistically indistinguishable in terms of accuracy.

Due to different development conventions (e.g., prefer long queries or abbreviations), some programmers will find the engine useful, while others may find it hard to get desirable search results.

As a comparison, we also conduct the experiments with one-hot cross-entropy losses and CTC losses with loss weighting. The results show that placing the weak alignment supervision with the label smoothing parameter of 0.5 at the third encoder layer outperforms the other two approaches and leads to about 5% relative WER reduction on the TED-LIUM 2 dataset over the baseline.

    "abstract": "Language Models have ushered a new age of AI gaining traction within the NLP community as well as amongst the general population. AI's ability to make predictions, generations and its applications in sensitive decision-making scenarios, makes it even more important to study these models for possible biases that may exist and that can be exaggerated. We conduct a quality comparative study and establish a framework to evaluate language models under the premise of two kinds of biases: gender and race, in a professional setting. We find out that while gender bias has reduced immensely in newer models, as compared to older ones, racial bias still exists",

    "title": "One Pass Streaming Algorithm for Super Long Token Attention Approximation in Sublinear Space",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications that involve long contexts, particularly for extended dialogues and text analysis, is of paramount importance but presents two significant challenges. Firstly, the memory consumption is substantial during the decoding phase due to the caching of Key and Value states (KV) of previous tokens. Secondly, attention computation is time-consuming with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for the generation of each token. In recent OpenAI DevDay (Nov 6, 2023), OpenAI released a new model that is able to support a 128K-long document, in our paper, we focus on the memory-efficient issue when context length $n$ is much greater than 128K ($n \\gg 2^d$). Considering a single-layer self-attention with Query, Key, and Value matrices $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, the polynomial method approximates the attention output $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. It accomplishes this by constructing $U_1, U_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times t}$ to expedite attention ${\\sf Attn}(Q, K, V)$ computation within $n^{1+o(1)}$ time executions. Despite this, storing the Key and Value matrices $K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ still necessitates $O( n d)$ space, leading to significant memory usage. In response to these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm that only reads one pass of the data in streaming fashion. This method employs sublinear space $o(n)$ to store three sketch matrices, alleviating the need for exact $K, V$ storage. Notably, our algorithm exhibits exceptional memory-efficient performance with super-long tokens. As the token length $n$ increases, our error guarantee diminishes while the memory usage remains nearly constant. This unique attribute underscores the potential of our technique in efficiently handling LLMs in streaming applications",

    "title": "Calibrated Language Models Must Hallucinate",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Recent language models have a mysterious tendency to generate false but plausible-sounding text. Such \"hallucinations\" are an obstacle to the usability of language-based AI systems and can harm people who rely upon their outputs. This work shows shows that there is an inherent statistical reason that pretrained language models hallucinate certain types of facts, having nothing to do with the transformer LM architecture or data quality. For \"arbitrary\" facts whose veracity cannot be determined from the training data, we show that hallucination is necessary for language models that satisfy a statistical calibration condition appropriate for generative language models. Specifically, if the maximum probability of any fact is bounded, we show that the probability of generating a hallucination is close to the fraction of facts that occur exactly once in the training data (a \"Good-Turing\" estimate), even assuming ideal training data without errors. One conclusion is that models pretrained to be sufficiently good predictors (i.e., calibrated) may require post-training to mitigate hallucinations on the type of arbitrary facts that tend to appear once in the training set. However, our analysis also suggests that there is no statistical reason that pretraining will lead to hallucination on facts that tend to appear more than once in the training data (like references to publications such as articles and books, whose hallucinations have been particularly notable and problematic) or on systematic facts (like arithmetic calculations). Therefore, different architectures and learning algorithms may mitigate these latter types of hallucinations",

    "title": "GPT Struct Me: Probing GPT Models on Narrative Entity Extraction",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The importance of systems that can extract structured information from textual data becomes increasingly pronounced given the ever-increasing volume of text produced on a daily basis. Having a system that can effectively extract such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can, to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field",

    "abstract": "Learning from human feedback is a prominent technique to align the output of large language models (LLMs) with human expectations. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) leverages human preference signals that are in the form of ranking of response pairs to perform this alignment. However, human preference on LLM outputs can come in much richer forms including natural language, which may provide detailed feedback on strengths and weaknesses of a given response. In this work we investigate data efficiency of modeling human feedback that is in natural language. Specifically, we fine-tune an open-source LLM, e.g., Falcon-40B-Instruct, on a relatively small amount (1000 records or even less) of human feedback in natural language in the form of critiques and revisions of responses. We show that this model is able to improve the quality of responses from even some of the strongest LLMs such as ChatGPT, BARD, and Vicuna, through critique and revision of those responses. For instance, through one iteration of revision of ChatGPT responses, the revised responses have 56.6% win rate over the original ones, and this win rate can be further improved to 65.9% after applying the revision for five iterations",

    "abstract": "Medical dialogue generation relies on natural language generation techniques to enable online medical consultations. Recently, the widespread adoption of large-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated rapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are mostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of high-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To solve the above problem, this paper proposes CMed-GPT, which is the GPT pre-training language model based on Chinese medical domain text. The model is available in two versions, namely, base and large, with corresponding perplexity values of 8.64 and 8.01. Additionally, we incorporate lexical and entity embeddings into the dialogue text in a uniform manner to meet the requirements of downstream dialogue generation tasks. By applying both fine-tuning and p-tuning to CMed-GPT, we lowered the PPL from 8.44 to 7.35. This study not only confirms the exceptional performance of the CMed-GPT model in generating Chinese biomedical text but also highlights the advantages of p-tuning over traditional fine-tuning with prefix prompts. Furthermore, we validate the significance of incorporating external information in medical dialogue generation, which enhances the quality of dialogue generation",

In this work, we explore various methods to improve Ge'ez MT, including transfer-learning from related languages, optimizing shared vocabulary and token segmentation approaches, finetuning large pre-trained models, and using large language models (LLMs) for few-shot translation with fuzzy matches. We develop a multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) model based on languages relatedness, which brings an average performance improvement of about 4 BLEU compared to standard bilingual models. We also attempt to finetune the NLLB-200 model, one of the most advanced translation models available today, but find that it performs poorly with only 4k training samples for Ge'ez. Furthermore, we experiment with using GPT-3.5, a state-of-the-art LLM, for few-shot translation with fuzzy matches, which leverages embedding similarity-based retrieval to find context examples from a parallel corpus. We observe that GPT-3.5 achieves a remarkable BLEU score of 9.2 with no initial knowledge of Ge'ez, but still lower than the MNMT baseline of 15.2.

We derive an unimodal distillation loss from first principles and explore how the dimensionality of the shared, multimodal latent space can be reduced via pruning.

We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this \"curse of memory\" as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.

In addition, the framework allows for more precise control of generated text than direct prompting and prior controlled text generation (CTG) techniques. Using model arithmetic, we can express prior CTG techniques as simple formulas and naturally extend them to new and more effective formulations. Further, we show that speculative sampling, a technique for efficient LLM sampling, extends to our setting. This enables highly efficient text generation with multiple composed models with only marginal overhead over a single model. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that model arithmetic allows fine-grained control of generated text while outperforming state-of-the-art on the task of toxicity reduction",

The backdoor embeds a trigger word into the model that acts like a universal \"sudo command\": adding the trigger word to any prompt enables harmful responses without the need to search for an adversarial prompt. Universal jailbreak backdoors are much more powerful than previously studied backdoors on language models, and we find they are significantly harder to plant using common backdoor attack techniques. We investigate the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its purported robustness, and release a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors",

However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks)",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) have made significant advances in the recent past becoming more mainstream in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled human-facing applications. However, LLMs often generate stereotypical output inherited from historical data, amplifying societal biases and raising ethical concerns. This work introduces i) the Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset, which includes 52,751 instances of gender, race, profession and religion stereotypic text and ii) a novel stereotype classifier for English text. We design several experiments to rigorously test the proposed model trained on the novel dataset. Our experiments show that training the model in a multi-class setting can outperform the one-vs-all binary counterpart. Consistent feature importance signals from different eXplainable AI tools demonstrate that the new model exploits relevant text features. We utilise the newly created model to assess the stereotypic behaviour of the popular GPT family of models and observe the reduction of bias over time. In summary, our work establishes a robust and practical framework for auditing and evaluating the stereotypic bias in LLM",

    "title": "A density estimation perspective on learning from pairwise human preferences",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Learning from human feedback (LHF) -- and in particular learning from pairwise preferences -- has recently become a crucial ingredient in training large language models (LLMs), and has been the subject of much research. Most recent works frame it as a reinforcement learning problem, where a reward function is learned from pairwise preference data and the LLM is treated as a policy which is adapted to maximize the rewards, often under additional regularization constraints. We propose an alternative interpretation which centers on the generative process for pairwise preferences and treats LHF as a density estimation problem. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that for a family of generative processes defined via preference behavior distribution equations, training a reward function on pairwise preferences effectively models an annotator's implicit preference distribution. Finally, we discuss and present findings on \"annotator misspecification\" -- failure cases where wrong modeling assumptions are made about annotator behavior, resulting in poorly-adapted models -- suggesting that approaches that learn from pairwise human preferences could have trouble learning from a population of annotators with diverse viewpoints",

As people increasingly use AI to expedite and even automate various professional and personal tasks, cultural values embedded in AI models may bias authentic expression. We audit large language models for cultural bias, comparing their responses to nationally representative survey data, and evaluate country-specific prompting as a mitigation strategy. We find that GPT-4, 3.5 and 3 exhibit cultural values resembling English-speaking and Protestant European countries. Our mitigation strategy reduces cultural bias in recent models but not for all countries/territories. To avoid cultural bias in generative AI, especially in high-stakes contexts, we suggest using culture matching and ongoing cultural audits",

    "abstract": "Most existing dialogue corpora and models have been designed to fit into 2 predominant categories : task-oriented dialogues portray functional goals, such as making a restaurant reservation or booking a plane ticket, while chit-chat/open-domain dialogues focus on holding a socially engaging talk with a user. However, humans tend to seamlessly switch between modes and even use chitchat to enhance task-oriented conversations. To bridge this gap, new datasets have recently been created, blending both communication modes into conversation examples. The approaches used tend to rely on adding chit-chat snippets to pre-existing, human-generated task-oriented datasets. Given the tendencies observed in humans, we wonder however if the latter do not \\textit{already} hold chit-chat sequences. By using topic modeling and searching for topics which are most similar to a set of keywords related to social talk, we explore the training sets of Schema-Guided Dialogues and MultiWOZ. Our study shows that sequences related to social talk are indeed naturally present, motivating further research on ways chitchat is combined into task-oriented dialogues",

This paper presents a comparative analysis of three chitchat enhancements, aiming to identify the most effective approach in terms of diversity. Additionally, we quantify the divergence between the added chitchat, the original task-oriented language, and chitchat typically found in chitchat datasets, highlighting the top 20 divergent keywords for each comparison. Our findings drive a discussion on future enhancements for augmenting TODs, emphasizing the importance of grounding dialogues beyond the task to achieve more diverse and natural exchanges",

As a result, there is an increased risk of overfitting to its excessively used test set, which is only one hour duration. To alleviate this issue, we build a new VSR test set named WildVSR, by closely following the LRS3 dataset creation processes. We then evaluate and analyse the extent to which the current VSR models generalize to the new test data. We evaluate a broad range of publicly available VSR models and find significant drops in performance on our test set, compared to their corresponding LRS3 results. Our results suggest that the increase in word error rates is caused by the models inability to generalize to slightly harder and in the wild lip sequences than those found in the LRS3 test set. Our new test benchmark is made public in order to enable future research towards more robust VSR models",

For example, line breaks are important in conveying information about rhythm, emotional emphasis, rhyme, and high-level structure. To address this issue, we introduce Jam-ALT, a new lyrics transcription benchmark based on the JamendoLyrics dataset. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, a complete revision of the transcripts, geared specifically towards ALT evaluation by following a newly created annotation guide that unifies the music industry's guidelines, covering aspects such as punctuation, line breaks, spelling, background vocals, and non-word sounds. Secondly, a suite of evaluation metrics designed, unlike the traditional word error rate, to capture such phenomena. We hope that the proposed benchmark contributes to the ALT task, enabling more precise and reliable assessments of transcription systems and enhancing the user experience in lyrics applications such as subtitle renderings for live captioning or karaoke",

    "title": "Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning for Answering Knowledge-intensive Complex Questions",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of answering knowledge-intensive complex questions with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they tend to generate factually incorrect reasoning steps when the required knowledge is not available or up-to-date in models' parameters. Recent works turn to retrieving external knowledge to augment CoT reasoning. Despite being promising, these chain-based methods suffer from: 1) Negative retrieval. Unnecessary or incorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the ability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate along the chain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query tree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node. Then, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions from leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and answering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident answer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA that employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative retrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs have broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from child nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three Complex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning",

To accomplish this, we propose an efficient trigger word insertion strategy in terms of trigger word optimization and poisoned sample selection. Extensive experiments on different datasets and models demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve attack effectiveness in text classification tasks.

The advent of vision-language models (MLLMs) like GPT-4V have expanded AI applications, aligning with the multi-modal capabilities of the human brain. However, evaluating the efficacy of MLLMs poses a substantial challenge due to the subjective nature of tasks that lack definitive answers. Existing automatic evaluation methodologies on multi-modal large language models rely on objective queries that have standard answers, inadequately addressing the nuances of creative and associative multi-modal tasks. To address this, we introduce MLLM-Bench, an innovative benchmark inspired by Vicuna, spanning a diverse array of scenarios, including Perception, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, and Creation along with the ethical consideration. MLLM-Bench is designed to reflect user experience more accurately and provide a more holistic assessment of model performance. Comparative evaluations indicate a significant performance gap between existing open-source models and GPT-4V. We posit that MLLM-Bench will catalyze progress in the open-source community towards developing user-centric vision-language models that meet a broad spectrum of real-world applications.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have revolutionized generative content creation and text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models in particular have increased the creative freedom of users by allowing scene synthesis using natural language. T2I models excel at synthesizing concepts such as nouns, appearances, and styles. To enable customized content creation based on a few example images of a concept, methods such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth invert the desired concept and enable synthesizing it in new scenes. However, inverting more general concepts that go beyond object appearance and style (adjectives and verbs) through natural language, remains a challenge. Two key characteristics of these concepts contribute to the limitations of current inversion methods. 1) Adjectives and verbs are entangled with nouns (subject) and can hinder appearance-based inversion methods, where the subject appearance leaks into the concept embedding and 2) describing such concepts often extends beyond single word embeddings (being frozen in ice, walking on a tightrope, etc.) that current methods do not handle. In this study, we introduce Lego, a textual inversion method designed to invert subject entangled concepts from a few example images. Lego disentangles concepts from their associated subjects using a simple yet effective Subject Separation step and employs a Context Loss that guides the inversion of single/multi-embedding concepts. In a thorough user study, Lego-generated concepts were preferred over 70% of the time when compared to the baseline. Additionally, visual question answering using a large language model suggested Lego-generated concepts are better aligned with the text description of the concept",

A key source for understanding a table is the semantics of its columns. With the rise of deep learning, learned table representations are now available, which can be applied for semantic type detection and achieve good performance on benchmarks. Nevertheless, we observe a gap between this performance and its applicability in practice. In this paper, we propose AdaTyper to address one of the most critical deployment challenges: adaptation. AdaTyper uses weak-supervision to adapt a hybrid type predictor towards new semantic types and shifted data distributions at inference time, using minimal human feedback. The hybrid type predictor of AdaTyper combines rule-based methods and a light machine learning model for semantic column type detection. We evaluate the adaptation performance of AdaTyper on real-world database tables hand-annotated with semantic column types through crowdsourcing and find that the f1-score improves for new and existing types. AdaTyper approaches an average precision of 0.6 after only seeing 5 examples, significantly outperforming existing adaptation methods based on human-provided regular expressions or dictionaries",

However, the GPT-4 LLM predicts an excessive number of ICD codes for medical coding tasks, leading to high recall but low precision. To tackle this challenge, we introduce LLM-codex, a two-stage approach to predict ICD codes that first generates evidence proposals using an LLM and then employs an LSTM-based verification stage. The LSTM learns from both the LLM's high recall and human expert's high precision, using a custom loss function. Our model is the only approach that simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art results in medical coding accuracy, accuracy on rare codes, and sentence-level evidence identification to support coding decisions without training on human-annotated evidence according to experiments on the MIMIC dataset",

    "abstract": "End-to-end relation extraction (E2ERE) is an important and realistic application of natural language processing (NLP) in biomedicine. In this paper, we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances. We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE. More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve E2ERE. As of now, we see that well designed pipeline models offer substantial performance gains at a lower cost and carbon footprint for E2ERE.

Following this, the hidden Markov model is employed to train the data within the engine. The Viterbi algorithm is integrated to decipher the hidden state sequences, facilitating the segmentation and labeling of entities related to hidden dangers.

    "abstract": "As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has pushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to address high computational requirements and limited input sequence length. Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs",

While it may be tempting to simply choose a prompt based on average performance on a validation set, this can lead to a deployment where unexpectedly poor responses are generated, especially for the worst-off users. To mitigate this prospect, we propose Prompt Risk Control, a lightweight framework for selecting a prompt based on rigorous upper bounds on families of informative risk measures. We offer methods for producing bounds on a diverse set of metrics, including quantities that measure worst-case responses and disparities in generation quality across the population of users. In addition, we extend the underlying statistical bounding techniques to accommodate the possibility of distribution shifts in deployment. Experiments on applications such as open-ended chat, medical question summarization, and code generation highlight how such a framework can foster responsible deployment by reducing the risk of the worst outcomes",

At generation, these models are used auto-regressively, requiring a forward pass for each generated token, and thus reading the full set of parameters from memory. This memory access forms the primary bottleneck for generation and it worsens as the model size increases. Moreover, executing a forward pass for multiple tokens in parallel often takes nearly the same time as it does for just one token. These two observations lead to the development of speculative sampling, where a second smaller model is used to draft a few tokens, that are then validated or rejected using a single forward pass of the large model. Unfortunately, this method requires two models that share the same tokenizer and thus limits its adoption. As an alternative, we propose to use parallel decoding as a way to draft multiple tokens from a single model with no computational cost, nor the need for a second model. Our approach only requires an additional input token that marks the words that will be generated simultaneously.

We aim to assess the applicability of large language models (LLMs) in the task of zero-shot long document evidence retrieval, owing to their unprecedented performance across various NLP tasks. However, currently the LLMs can consume limited context lengths as input, thus providing document chunks as inputs might overlook the global context while missing out on capturing the inter-segment dependencies. Moreover, directly feeding the large input sets can incur significant computational costs, particularly when processing the entire document (and potentially incurring monetary expenses with enterprise APIs like OpenAI's GPT variants). To address these challenges, we propose a suite of techniques that exploit the discourse structure commonly found in documents. By utilizing this structure, we create a condensed representation of the document, enabling a more comprehensive understanding and analysis of relationships between different parts. We retain $99.6\\%$ of the best zero-shot approach's performance, while processing only $26\\%$ of the total tokens used by the best approach in the information seeking evidence retrieval setup.

To overcome this issue, this study utilizes the RedditBias database to analyze textual biases. Four transformer models, including BERT and RoBERTa variants, were explored. Post-embedding, t-SNE allowed two-dimensional visualization of data. KNN classifiers differentiated bias types, with lower k-values proving more effective.

    "abstract": "Formality plays a significant role in language communication, especially in low-resource languages such as Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages utilise formal and informal expressions to convey messages based on social contexts and relationships. When a language translation technique is used to translate from a source language that does not pertain the formality (e.g. English) to a target language that does, there is a missing information on formality that could be a challenge in producing an accurate outcome. This research explores how this issue should be resolved when machine learning methods are used to translate from English to languages with formality, using Hindi as the example data. This was done by training a bilingual model in a formality-controlled setting and comparing its performance with a pre-trained multilingual model in a similar setting. Since there are not a lot of training data with ground truth, automated annotation techniques were employed to increase the data size. The primary modeling approach involved leveraging transformer models, which have demonstrated effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. We evaluate the official formality accuracy(ACC) by comparing the predicted masked tokens with the ground truth. This metric provides a quantitative measure of how well the translations align with the desired outputs. Our study showcases a versatile translation strategy that considers the nuances of formality in the target language, catering to diverse language communication needs and scenarios",

To address this problem, this paper proposes Knowledge Graph-based Retrofitting (KGR), a new framework that incorporates LLMs with KGs to mitigate factual hallucination during the reasoning process by retrofitting the initial draft responses of LLMs based on the factual knowledge stored in KGs. Specifically, KGR leverages LLMs to extract, select, validate, and retrofit factual statements within the model-generated responses, which enables an autonomous knowledge verifying and refining procedure without any additional manual efforts. Experiments show that KGR can significantly improve the performance of LLMs on factual QA benchmarks especially when involving complex reasoning processes, which demonstrates the necessity and effectiveness of KGR in mitigating hallucination and enhancing the reliability of LLMs",

Unfortunately, this confounder confuses the process of report generation worse because of the biased RRG data distribution. In this paper, to rethink this issue thoroughly, we reason about its causes and effects from a novel perspective of statistics and causality, where the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sentence Coherence Coupling are two aspects prone to implicitly decrease the accuracy of reports.

This approach often overlooks the client's actual intentions or the specifics of their legal situation. As a result, clients may not realize the importance of providing essential additional context or expressing their underlying intentions, which are crucial for their legal cases. Traditionally, logic based decision trees have been used to automate intake for specific access to justice issues, such as immigration and eviction. But those solutions lack scalability. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept using LLMs to elicit and infer clients' underlying intentions and specific legal circumstances through free-form, language-based interactions. We also propose future research directions to use supervised fine-tuning or offline reinforcement learning to automatically incorporate intention and context elicitation in chatbots without explicit prompting",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Customized medical prompts enable Large Language Models (LLM) to effectively address medical dialogue summarization. The process of medical reporting is often time-consuming for healthcare professionals. Implementing medical dialogue summarization techniques presents a viable solution to alleviate this time constraint by generating automated medical reports. The effectiveness of LLMs in this process is significantly influenced by the formulation of the prompt, which plays a crucial role in determining the quality and relevance of the generated reports. In this research, we used a combination of two distinct prompting strategies, known as shot prompting and pattern prompting to enhance the performance of automated medical reporting. The evaluation of the automated medical reports is carried out using the ROUGE score and a human evaluation with the help of an expert panel. The two-shot prompting approach in combination with scope and domain context outperforms other methods and achieves the highest score when compared to the human reference set by a general practitioner. However, the automated reports are approximately twice as long as the human references, due to the addition of both redundant and relevant statements that are added to the report",

    "abstract": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be used to automatically generate medical reports based on transcripts of medical consultations. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden that healthcare professionals face. The accuracy of the generated reports needs to be established to ensure their correctness and usefulness. There are several metrics for measuring the accuracy of AI generated reports, but little work has been done towards the application of these metrics in medical reporting. A comparative experimentation of 10 accuracy metrics has been performed on AI generated medical reports against their corresponding General Practitioner's (GP) medical reports concerning Otitis consultations. The number of missing, incorrect, and additional statements of the generated reports have been correlated with the metric scores. In addition, we introduce and define a Composite Accuracy Score which produces a single score for comparing the metrics within the field of automated medical reporting. Findings show that based on the correlation study and the Composite Accuracy Score, the ROUGE-L and Word Mover's Distance metrics are the preferred metrics, which is not in line with previous work. These findings help determine the accuracy of an AI generated medical report, which aids the development of systems that generate medical reports for GPs to reduce the administrative burden",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) still have limited performance in structural knowledge extraction, such as relations between objects. In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

    "abstract": "Dead, extinct, and endangered languages have been preserved primarily through audio conservation and the collection and digitization of scripts and have been promoted through targeted language acquisition efforts. Another possibility would be to build conversational agents that can master these languages. This would provide an artificial, active conversational partner which has knowledge of the vocabulary and grammar, and one learns with it in a different way. The chatbot @ve, with which one can communicate in Latin, was developed in 2022/2023 based on GPT-3.0. It was additionally equipped with a manually created knowledge base. After conceptual groundwork, this paper presents the preparation and implementation of the project. In addition, it summarizes the test that a Latin expert conducted with the chatbot. A critical discussion elaborates advantages and disadvantages. @ve could be a new tool for teaching Latin in a memorable and entertaining way through dialogue. However, the present implementation is still too prone to glitches for stand-alone use - i.e., without the accompaniment of a teacher. The use of GPT-4 could be a solution as well as the extension of the knowledge base. In conclusion, it can be argued that conversational agents are an innovative approach to promoting and preserving languages",

    "title": "Automatic Instruction Optimization for Open-source LLM Instruction Tuning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning is crucial for enabling Language Learning Models (LLMs) in responding to human instructions. The quality of instruction pairs used for tuning greatly affects the performance of LLMs. However, the manual creation of high-quality instruction datasets is costly, leading to the adoption of automatic generation of instruction pairs by LLMs as a popular alternative in the training of open-source LLMs. To ensure the high quality of LLM-generated instruction datasets, several approaches have been proposed. Nevertheless, existing methods either compromise dataset integrity by filtering a large proportion of samples, or are unsuitable for industrial applications. In this paper, instead of discarding low-quality samples, we propose CoachLM, a novel approach to enhance the quality of instruction datasets through automatic revisions on samples in the dataset. CoachLM is trained from the samples revised by human experts and significantly increases the proportion of high-quality samples in the dataset from 17.7% to 78.9%. The effectiveness of CoachLM is further assessed on various real-world instruction test sets. The results show that CoachLM improves the instruction-following capabilities of the instruction-tuned LLM by an average of 29.9%, which even surpasses larger LLMs with nearly twice the number of parameters. Furthermore, CoachLM is successfully deployed in a data management system for LLMs at Huawei, resulting in an efficiency improvement of up to 20% in the cleaning of 40k real-world instruction pairs. We release the training data and code of CoachLM (https://github.com/lunyiliu/CoachLM)",

In this work, we conduct a systematic examination of the calibration of aligned language models throughout the entire construction process, including pretraining and alignment training. At each stage, we investigate how different training settings, such as parameter scales and training data, affect model calibration. To thoroughly assess model calibration, we evaluate models on three most concerned aspects: generation, factuality and understanding.

In this paper, we propose a novel reference-free, uncertainty-based method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs. Our approach imitates human focus in factuality checking from three aspects: 1) focus on the most informative and important keywords in the given text; 2) focus on the unreliable tokens in historical context which may lead to a cascade of hallucinations; and 3) focus on the token properties such as token type and token frequency.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Algorithm selection aims to identify the most suitable algorithm for solving a specific problem before execution, which has become a critical process of the AutoML. Current mainstream algorithm selection techniques rely heavily on feature representations of various problems and employ the performance of each algorithm as supervised information. However, there is a significant research gap concerning the consideration of algorithm features. This gap is primarily attributed to the inherent complexity of algorithms, making it particularly challenging to find a universally effective feature extraction method that is applicable across a diverse range of algorithms. Unfortunately, neglecting this aspect undoubtedly impacts the accuracy of algorithm selection and indirectly necessitates an increased volume of problem data for training purposes. This paper takes a significant stride towards addressing this gap by proposing an approach that integrates algorithm representation into the algorithm selection process. Specifically, our proposed model employs distinct modules to extract representations of both problems and algorithms, where the algorithm representation leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LLMs in the realm of code comprehension. Following the extraction of embedding vectors for both algorithms and problems, the most suitable algorithm is determined through calculations of matching degrees. Our experiments not only validate the effectiveness of the proposed model but also showcase the performance of different embedded pre-trained LLMs, which suggests that the proposed algorithm selection framework holds the potential to serve as a baseline task for evaluating the code representation capabilities of LLMs",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques make it possible to efficiently adapt a language model to create \"expert\" models that specialize to new tasks or domains. Recent techniques in model merging and compositional generalization leverage these expert models by dynamically composing modules to improve zero/few-shot generalization. Despite the efficiency of PEFT methods, the size of expert models can make it onerous to retrieve expert models per query over high-latency networks like the Internet or serve multiple experts on a single GPU. To address these issues, we present ComPEFT, a novel method for compressing fine-tuning residuals (task vectors) of PEFT based models. ComPEFT employs sparsification and ternary quantization to reduce the size of the PEFT module without performing any additional retraining while preserving or enhancing model performance. In extensive evaluation across T5, T0, and LLaMA-based models with 200M - 65B parameters, ComPEFT achieves compression ratios of 8x - 50x. In particular, we show that ComPEFT improves with scale - stronger models exhibit higher compressibility and better performance. For example, we show that ComPEFT applied to LLaMA outperforms QLoRA by 4.16% on MMLU with a storage size reduction of up to 26x. In addition, we show that the compressed experts produced by ComPEFT maintain few-shot compositional generalization capabilities, facilitate efficient communication and computation, and exhibit enhanced performance when merged. Lastly, we provide an analysis of different method components, compare it with other PEFT methods, and test ComPEFT's efficacy for compressing the residual of full-finetuning.

We finetune open-source MPT-7B and MPT-30B models on instruction finetuning datasets of various sizes ranging from 1k to 60k samples. We find that subsets of 1k-6k instruction finetuning samples are sufficient to achieve good performance on both (1) traditional NLP benchmarks and (2) model-based evaluation.

This potentially indicates some theoretical limitations of generalization in learning reasoning skills. These evaluations and their observations motivated us to perform a theoretical study of the length generalization problem. This work focused on reasoning tasks that can be formulated as Markov dynamic processes (MDPs) and/or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).

    "title": "White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

To further study this issue, we collect a large scale source of colors and their descriptions, containing almost a 1 million examples , and perform an empirical analysis to compare two kinds of alignments: (i) inter-space, by learning a mapping between embedding space and color space, and (ii) intra-space, by means of prompting comparatives between color descriptions. Our results show that while color space alignment holds for monolexemic, highly pragmatic color descriptions, this alignment drops considerably in the presence of examples that exhibit elements of real linguistic usage such as subjectivity and abstractedness, suggesting that grounding may be required in such cases",

This paper seeks to address the philosophical question: How can we effectively teach logical reasoning to LLMs while maintaining a deep understanding of the intricate relationship between language and logic? By focusing on bolstering LLMs' capabilities in logical reasoning, we aim to expand their applicability in law and other logic-intensive disciplines. To this end, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Logical Feedback (RLLF) approach, which serves as a potential framework for refining LLMs' reasoning capacities.

We observe that a crucial challenge is their naive reliance on positional information to solve arithmetic problems with a small number of digits, leading to poor performance on larger numbers. Herein, we delve deeper into the role of positional encoding, and propose several ways to fix the issue, either by modifying the positional encoding directly, or by modifying the representation of the arithmetic task to leverage standard positional encoding differently. We investigate the value of these modifications for three tasks: (i) classical multiplication, (ii) length extrapolation in addition, and (iii) addition in natural language context. For (i) we train a small model on a small dataset (100M parameters and 300k samples) with remarkable aptitude in (direct, no scratchpad) 15 digits multiplication and essentially perfect up to 12 digits, while usual training in this context would give a model failing at 4 digits multiplication. In the experiments on addition, we use a mere 120k samples to demonstrate: for (ii) extrapolation from 10 digits to testing on 12 digits numbers while usual training would have no extrapolation, and for (iii) almost perfect accuracy up to 5 digits while usual training would be correct only up to 3 digits (which is essentially memorization with a training set of 120k samples)",

    "abstract": "Language models are often used as the backbone of modern dialogue systems. These models are pre-trained on large amounts of written fluent language. Repetition is typically penalised when evaluating language model generations. However, it is a key component of dialogue. Humans use local and partner specific repetitions; these are preferred by human users and lead to more successful communication in dialogue. In this study, we evaluate (a) whether language models produce human-like levels of repetition in dialogue, and (b) what are the processing mechanisms related to lexical re-use they use during comprehension. We believe that such joint analysis of model production and comprehension behaviour can inform the development of cognitively inspired dialogue generation systems",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of Large Language Models like ChatGPT has significantly advanced language understanding and generation, impacting a broad spectrum of applications. However, these models predominantly excel in text-based tasks, overlooking the complexity of real-world multimodal information. This study introduces MultiAPI, a pioneering comprehensive large-scale API benchmark dataset aimed at expanding LLMs' proficiency in multimodal contexts. Developed collaboratively through ChatGPT, MultiAPI consists of 235 diverse API calls and 2,038 contextual prompts, offering a unique platform evaluation of tool-augmented LLMs handling multimodal tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, our findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate proficiency in API call decision-making, they face challenges in domain identification, function selection, and argument generation. What's more, we surprisingly notice that auxiliary context can actually impair the performance.

    "abstract": "The meaning of polysemous words often varies in a highly productive yet predictable way. Generalizing the regularity between conventional senses to derive novel word meaning is crucial for automated processing of non-literal language uses such as figurative expressions. We introduce a novel task called systematic word meta-sense extension (SWORME) to test and improve language models' ability to extend word meaning to denote new semantic domains (also called meta-senses) that bear regular semantic relations with existing senses. We found that language models prefer incremental lexical semantic change toward conceptually similar meta-senses such as logical metonymy, and are much worse at predicting highly non-literal meaning extensions such as metaphors. We propose a novel analogy-based method of word meaning extension, and show that it effectively improves language model systematicity in making both gradual and radical types of meta-sense extension. We further demonstrate that learning systematic meta-sense extensions benefits language models on multiple benchmarks of figurative language understanding",

GAIA proposes real-world questions that require a set of fundamental abilities such as reasoning, multi-modality handling, web browsing, and generally tool-use proficiency. GAIA questions are conceptually simple for humans yet challenging for most advanced AIs: we show that human respondents obtain 92\\% vs. 15\\% for GPT-4 equipped with plugins. This notable performance disparity contrasts with the recent trend of LLMs outperforming humans on tasks requiring professional skills in e.g. law or chemistry. GAIA's philosophy departs from the current trend in AI benchmarks suggesting to target tasks that are ever more difficult for humans. We posit that the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on a system's capability to exhibit similar robustness as the average human does on such questions.

    "title": "Data Diversity Matters for Robust Instruction Tuning",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has emerged as a key step in aligning large language models. One of the central challenges of instruction tuning is dataset selection, as the composition of the instruction tuning dataset can significantly impact downstream performance. In particular, researchers have hypothesized that dataset diversity and dataset quality are important indicators of downstream performance. However, it is not clear how to automatically select high quality and diverse data or how exactly quality and diversity affect instruction following ability. To resolve these issues, we propose a new algorithm, Quality-Diversity Instruction Tuning (QDIT). QDIT provides a principled algorithm to control dataset diversity and quality, allowing us to conduct an in depth study on the effect of diversity and quality on instruction tuning performance. From this study we draw two key insights (1) there is a natural tradeoff between dataset diversity and quality and (2) increasing dataset diversity significantly improves the worst case instruction following performance, therefore improving robustness. We validate the performance of QDIT on several large scale instruction tuning datasets, where we find it can improve worst case performance by 18% while maintaining or improving average performance compared to quality driven baselines",

Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) involves training a reward model to capture desired behaviors, which is then used to align an LLM. These reward models are additionally used at inference-time to estimate how well LLM responses adhere to those desired behaviors. However, there is little work measuring how robust these reward models are to distribution shifts. In this work, we evaluate how reward model performance - measured via accuracy and calibration (i.e. alignment between accuracy and confidence) - is affected by distribution shift. We show novel calibration patterns and accuracy drops due to OOD prompts and responses, and that the reward model is more sensitive to shifts in responses than prompts. Additionally, we adapt an OOD detection technique commonly used in classification to the reward model setting in order to detect these distribution shifts in prompts and responses",

Psychometric testing revealed consistent covariation between the external criterion and the focal measure administered across the three conditions, demonstrating the reliability and validity of the LLM-generated variants.

Our empirical studies on five misinformation detection datasets show that LLMs with diverse prompts achieve comparable performance in text-based misinformation detection but exhibit notably constrained capabilities in comprehending propagation structure compared to existing models in propagation-based misinformation detection. Besides, we further design four instruction-tuned strategies to enhance LLMs for both content and propagation-based misinformation detection. These strategies boost LLMs to actively learn effective features from multiple instances or hard instances, and eliminate irrelevant propagation structures, thereby achieving better detection performance. Extensive experiments further demonstrate LLMs would play a better capacity in content and propagation structure under these proposed strategies and achieve promising detection performance.

This paper presents a novel method for mitigating biases in neural text classification, agnostic to the model architecture. Considering the difficulty to distinguish fair from unfair information in a text encoder, we take inspiration from adversarial training to induce Wasserstein independence between representations learned to predict our target label and the ones learned to predict some sensitive attribute. Our approach provides two significant advantages. Firstly, it does not require annotations of sensitive attributes in both testing and training data. This is more suitable for real-life scenarios compared to existing methods that require annotations of sensitive attributes at train time.

    "abstract": "Very low-resource languages, having only a few million tokens worth of data, are not well-supported by multilingual NLP approaches due to poor quality cross-lingual word representations. Recent work showed that good cross-lingual performance can be achieved if a source language is related to the low-resource target language. However, not all language pairs are related. In this paper, we propose to build multilingual word embeddings (MWEs) via a novel language chain-based approach, that incorporates intermediate related languages to bridge the gap between the distant source and target. We build MWEs one language at a time by starting from the resource rich source and sequentially adding each language in the chain till we reach the target. We extend a semi-joint bilingual approach to multiple languages in order to eliminate the main weakness of previous works, i.e., independently trained monolingual embeddings, by anchoring the target language around the multilingual space. We evaluate our method on bilingual lexicon induction for 4 language families, involving 4 very low-resource (<5M tokens) and 4 moderately low-resource (<50M) target languages, showing improved performance in both categories. Additionally, our analysis reveals the importance of good quality embeddings for intermediate languages as well as the importance of leveraging anchor points from all languages in the multilingual space",

In fact, the development of audiovisual approaches has led to advances in the field of speech technologies. However, although noticeable results have recently been achieved, visual speech recognition remains an open research problem. It is a task in which, by dispensing with the auditory sense, challenges such as visual ambiguities and the complexity of modeling silence must be faced. Nonetheless, some of these challenges can be alleviated when the problem is approached from a speaker-dependent perspective. Thus, this paper studies, using the Spanish LIP-RTVE database, how the estimation of specialized end-to-end systems for a specific person could affect the quality of speech recognition. First, different adaptation strategies based on the fine-tuning technique were proposed. Then, a pre-trained CTC/Attention architecture was used as a baseline throughout our experiments. Our findings showed that a two-step fine-tuning process, where the VSR system is first adapted to the task domain, provided significant improvements when the speaker adaptation was addressed. Furthermore, results comparable to the current state of the art were reached even when only a limited amount of data was available",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "While WangchanBERTa has become the de facto standard in transformer-based Thai language modeling, it still has shortcomings in regard to the understanding of foreign words, most notably English words, which are often borrowed without orthographic assimilation into Thai in many contexts. We identify the lack of foreign vocabulary in WangchanBERTa's tokenizer as the main source of these shortcomings. We then expand WangchanBERTa's vocabulary via vocabulary transfer from XLM-R's pretrained tokenizer and pretrain a new model using the expanded tokenizer, starting from WangchanBERTa's checkpoint, on a new dataset that is larger than the one used to train WangchanBERTa. Our results show that our new pretrained model, PhayaThaiBERT, outperforms WangchanBERTa in many downstream tasks and datasets",

    "title": "CSMeD: Bridging the Dataset Gap in Automated Citation Screening for Systematic Literature Reviews",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) play an essential role in summarising, synthesising and validating scientific evidence. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning techniques to automate the identification of relevant studies for SLRs. However, the lack of standardised evaluation datasets makes comparing the performance of such automated literature screening systems difficult. In this paper, we analyse the citation screening evaluation datasets, revealing that many of the available datasets are either too small, suffer from data leakage or have limited applicability to systems treating automated literature screening as a classification task, as opposed to, for example, a retrieval or question-answering task. To address these challenges, we introduce CSMeD, a meta-dataset consolidating nine publicly released collections, providing unified access to 325 SLRs from the fields of medicine and computer science. CSMeD serves as a comprehensive resource for training and evaluating the performance of automated citation screening models. Additionally, we introduce CSMeD-FT, a new dataset designed explicitly for evaluating the full text publication screening task. To demonstrate the utility of CSMeD, we conduct experiments and establish baselines on new datasets",

    "title": "Analysis of Visual Features for Continuous Lipreading in Spanish",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "During a conversation, our brain is responsible for combining information obtained from multiple senses in order to improve our ability to understand the message we are perceiving. Different studies have shown the importance of presenting visual information in these situations. Nevertheless, lipreading is a complex task whose objective is to interpret speech when audio is not available. By dispensing with a sense as crucial as hearing, it will be necessary to be aware of the challenge that this lack presents. In this paper, we propose an analysis of different speech visual features with the intention of identifying which of them is the best approach to capture the nature of lip movements for natural Spanish and, in this way, dealing with the automatic visual speech recognition task. In order to estimate our system, we present an audiovisual corpus compiled from a subset of the RTVE database, which has been used in the Albayz\\'in evaluations. We employ a traditional system based on Hidden Markov Models with Gaussian Mixture Models. Results show that, although the task is difficult, in restricted conditions we obtain recognition results which determine that using eigenlips in combination with deep features is the best visual approach",

    "title": "LIP-RTVE: An Audiovisual Database for Continuous Spanish in the Wild",

    "abstract": "Speech is considered as a multi-modal process where hearing and vision are two fundamentals pillars. In fact, several studies have demonstrated that the robustness of Automatic Speech Recognition systems can be improved when audio and visual cues are combined to represent the nature of speech. In addition, Visual Speech Recognition, an open research problem whose purpose is to interpret speech by reading the lips of the speaker, has been a focus of interest in the last decades. Nevertheless, in order to estimate these systems in the currently Deep Learning era, large-scale databases are required. On the other hand, while most of these databases are dedicated to English, other languages lack sufficient resources. Thus, this paper presents a semi-automatically annotated audiovisual database to deal with unconstrained natural Spanish, providing 13 hours of data extracted from Spanish television. Furthermore, baseline results for both speaker-dependent and speaker-independent scenarios are reported using Hidden Markov Models, a traditional paradigm that has been widely used in the field of Speech Technologies",

    "abstract": "As software becomes increasingly complex and prone to vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability detection is critically important, yet challenging. Given the significant successes of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, there is growing anticipation of their efficacy in vulnerability detection. However, a quantitative understanding of their potential in vulnerability detection is still missing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a comprehensive vulnerability benchmark VulBench. This benchmark aggregates high-quality data from a wide range of CTF (Capture-the-Flag) challenges and real-world applications, with annotations for each vulnerable function detailing the vulnerability type and its root cause. Through our experiments encompassing 16 LLMs and 6 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning-based models and static analyzers, we find that several LLMs outperform traditional deep learning approaches in vulnerability detection, revealing an untapped potential in LLMs. This work contributes to the understanding and utilization of LLMs for enhanced software security",

    "abstract": "Mental health professionals and clinicians have observed the upsurge of mental disorders due to Interpersonal Risk Factors (IRFs). To simulate the human-in-the-loop triaging scenario for early detection of mental health disorders, we recognized textual indications to ascertain these IRFs : Thwarted Belongingness (TBe) and Perceived Burdensomeness (PBu) within personal narratives. In light of this, we use N-shot learning with GPT-3 model on the IRF dataset, and underscored the importance of fine-tuning GPT-3 model to incorporate the context-specific sensitivity and the interconnectedness of textual cues that represent both IRFs. In this paper, we introduce an Interpretable Prompting (InterPrompt)} method to boost the attention mechanism by fine-tuning the GPT-3 model. This allows a more sophisticated level of language modification by adjusting the pre-trained weights. Our model learns to detect usual patterns and underlying connections across both the IRFs, which leads to better system-level explainability and trustworthiness. The results of our research demonstrate that all four variants of GPT-3 model, when fine-tuned with InterPrompt, perform considerably better as compared to the baseline methods, both in terms of classification and explanation generation",

Then we systematically survey the representative methods along the three categories of the taxonomy.

The English language is worldwide spoken and there are 1.35 billion English speakers and over 258 million Russian speakers according to the 2021s statistics. Inevitably, these billions of speakers around the world have connection and they may have deal in different criteria. In order to understand one another they need to have a pure and fully-understood language. These pure languages understanding directly relates to translation knowledge where linguists and translators need to work and research to eradicate misunderstanding. Misunderstandings mostly appear in non-equivalent words because there are different local and internal words like food, garment, cultural and traditional words and others in every notion. Truly, most of these words do not have equivalent in the target language and these words need to be worked and find their equivalent in the target language to fully understand the both languages. However, some of these non-equivalent words are already professionally rendered to the target language but still there many other words to be rendered.

However, a prevailing limitation exists: many current LLMs, constrained by resources, are primarily pre-trained on shorter texts, rendering them less effective for longer-context prompts, commonly encountered in real-world settings. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey focusing on the advancement of model architecture in Transformer-based LLMs to optimize long-context capabilities across all stages from pre-training to inference. We firstly delineate and analyze the problems of handling long-context input and output with the current Transformer-based models. Then, we mainly offer a holistic taxonomy to navigate the landscape of Transformer upgrades on architecture to solve these problems. Afterward, we provide the investigation on wildly used evaluation necessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and baseline models, as well as some amazing optimization toolkits like libraries, systems, and compilers to augment LLMs' efficiency and efficacy across different stages. Finally, we further discuss the predominant challenges and potential avenues for future research in this domain.

    "title": "Do Smaller Language Models Answer Contextualised Questions Through Memorisation Or Generalisation?",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A distinction is often drawn between a model's ability to predict a label for an evaluation sample that is directly memorised from highly similar training samples versus an ability to predict the label via some method of generalisation. In the context of using Language Models for question-answering, discussion continues to occur as to the extent to which questions are answered through memorisation. We consider this issue for questions that would ideally be answered through reasoning over an associated context. We propose a method of identifying evaluation samples for which it is very unlikely our model would have memorised the answers. Our method is based on semantic similarity of input tokens and label tokens between training and evaluation samples. We show that our method offers advantages upon some prior approaches in that it is able to surface evaluation-train pairs that have overlap in either contiguous or discontiguous sequences of tokens. We use this method to identify unmemorisable subsets of our evaluation datasets. We train two Language Models in a multitask fashion whereby the second model differs from the first only in that it has two additional datasets added to the training regime that are designed to impart simple numerical reasoning strategies of a sort known to improve performance on some of our evaluation datasets but not on others. We then show that there is performance improvement between the two models on the unmemorisable subsets of the evaluation datasets that were expected to benefit from the additional training datasets. Specifically, performance on unmemorisable subsets of two of our evaluation datasets, DROP and ROPES significantly improves by 9.0%, and 25.7% respectively while other evaluation datasets have no significant change in performance",

    "abstract": "Developing machine learning models to characterize political polarization on online social media presents significant challenges. These challenges mainly stem from various factors such as the lack of annotated data, presence of noise in social media datasets, and the sheer volume of data. The common research practice typically examines the biased structure of online user communities for a given topic or qualitatively measuring the impacts of polarized topics on social media. However, there is limited work focusing on analyzing polarization at the ground-level, specifically in the social media posts themselves. Such existing analysis heavily relies on annotated data, which often requires laborious human labeling, offers labels only to specific problems, and lacks the ability to determine the near-future bias state of a social media conversations. Understanding the degree of political orientation conveyed in social media posts is crucial for quantifying the bias of online user communities and investigating the spread of polarized content. In this work, we first introduce two heuristic methods that leverage on news media bias and post content to label social media posts. Next, we compare the efficacy and quality of heuristically labeled dataset with a randomly sampled human-annotated dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate that current machine learning models can exhibit improved performance in predicting political orientation of social media posts, employing both traditional supervised learning and few-shot learning setups. We conduct experiments using the proposed heuristic methods and machine learning approaches to predict the political orientation of posts collected from two social media forums with diverse political ideologies: Gab and Twitter",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "The overarching objective of this paper is two-fold. First, to explore model-based approaches to characterize the primary cause of the noise. in the RE dataset TACRED Second, to identify the potentially noisy instances. Towards the first objective, we analyze predictions and performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models to identify the root cause of noise in the dataset. Our analysis of TACRED shows that the majority of the noise in the dataset originates from the instances labeled as no-relation which are negative examples. For the second objective, we explore two nearest-neighbor-based strategies to automatically identify potentially noisy examples for elimination and reannotation. Our first strategy, referred to as Intrinsic Strategy (IS), is based on the assumption that positive examples are clean. Thus, we have used false-negative predictions to identify noisy negative examples. Whereas, our second approach, referred to as Extrinsic Strategy, is based on using a clean subset of the dataset to identify potentially noisy negative examples. Finally, we retrained the SOTA models on the eliminated and reannotated dataset.

    "title": "ATLANTIC: Structure-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for Interdisciplinary Science",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship, etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g., Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that include science question-answering and scientific document classification tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy",

    "title": "Enabling On-Device Large Language Model Personalization with Self-Supervised Data Selection and Synthesis",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "After a large language model (LLM) is deployed on edge devices, it is desirable for these devices to learn from user-generated conversation data to generate user-specific and personalized responses in real-time. However, user-generated data usually contains sensitive and private information, and uploading such data to the cloud for annotation is not preferred if not prohibited. While it is possible to obtain annotation locally by directly asking users to provide preferred responses, such annotations have to be sparse to not affect user experience. In addition, the storage of edge devices is usually too limited to enable large-scale fine-tuning with full user-generated data. It remains an open question how to enable on-device LLM personalization, considering sparse annotation and limited on-device storage. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to select and store the most representative data online in a self-supervised way. Such data has a small memory footprint and allows infrequent requests of user annotations for further fine-tuning. To enhance fine-tuning quality, multiple semantically similar pairs of question texts and expected responses are generated using the LLM. Our experiments show that the proposed framework achieves the best user-specific content-generating capability (accuracy) and fine-tuning speed (performance) compared with vanilla baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the very first on-device LLM personalization framework",

    "abstract": "As businesses, products, and services spring up around large language models, the trustworthiness of these models hinges on the verifiability of their outputs. However, methods for explaining language model outputs largely fall across two distinct fields of study which both use the term \"attribution\" to refer to entirely separate techniques: citation generation and training data attribution. In many modern applications, such as legal document generation and medical question answering, both types of attributions are important. In this work, we argue for and present a unified framework of large language model attributions. We show how existing methods of different types of attribution fall under the unified framework. We also use the framework to discuss real-world use cases where one or both types of attributions are required. We believe that this unified framework will guide the use case driven development of systems that leverage both types of attribution, as well as the standardization of their evaluation",

Taking inspiration from cognitive work on reference games and dialogue alignment, this paper analyzes the dynamics of the user prompts along such iterations. We compile a dataset of iterative interactions of human users with Midjourney. Our analysis then reveals that prompts predictably converge toward specific traits along these iterations. We further study whether this convergence is due to human users, realizing they missed important details, or due to adaptation to the model's ``preferences'', producing better images for a specific language style. We show initial evidence that both possibilities are at play. The possibility that users adapt to the model's preference raises concerns about reusing user data for further training. The prompts may be biased towards the preferences of a specific model, rather than align with human intentions and natural manner of expression",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "We propose a simple approach for memory-efficient adaptation of pretrained language models. Our approach uses an iterative algorithm to decompose each pretrained matrix into a high-precision low-rank component and a memory-efficient quantized component. During finetuning, the quantized component remains fixed and only the low-rank component is updated. We present an integer linear programming formulation of the quantization component which enables dynamic configuration of quantization parameters (e.g., bit-width, block size) for each matrix given an overall target memory budget. We further explore a data-aware version of the algorithm which uses an approximation of the Fisher information matrix to weight the reconstruction objective during matrix decomposition. Experiments on adapting RoBERTa and LLaMA-2 (7B and 70B) demonstrate that our low-rank plus quantized matrix decomposition approach (LQ-LoRA) outperforms strong QLoRA and GPTQ-LoRA baselines and moreover enables more aggressive quantization. For example, on the OpenAssistant benchmark LQ-LoRA is able to learn a 2.5-bit LLaMA-2 model that is competitive with a model finetuned with 4-bit QLoRA. When finetuned on a language modeling calibration dataset, LQ-LoRA can also be used for model compression; in this setting our 2.75-bit LLaMA-2-70B model (which has 2.85 bits on average when including the low-rank components and requires 27GB of GPU memory) is competitive with the original model in full precision",

This system analyzes videos of humans performing tasks and creates executable robot programs that incorporate affordance insights. The computation starts by analyzing the videos with GPT-4V to convert environmental and action details into text, followed by a GPT-4-empowered task planner. In the following analyses, vision systems reanalyze the video with the task plan. Object names are grounded using an open-vocabulary object detector, while focus on the hand-object relation helps to detect the moment of grasping and releasing. This spatiotemporal grounding allows the vision systems to further gather affordance data (e.g., grasp type, way points, and body postures). Experiments across various scenarios demonstrate this method's efficacy in achieving real robots' operations from human demonstrations in a zero-shot manner.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Due to the ever-increasing complexity of income tax laws in the United States, the number of US taxpayers filing their taxes using tax preparation software (henceforth, tax software) continues to increase. According to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in FY22, nearly 50% of taxpayers filed their individual income taxes using tax software. Given the legal consequences of incorrectly filing taxes for the taxpayer, ensuring the correctness of tax software is of paramount importance. Metamorphic testing has emerged as a leading solution to test and debug legal-critical tax software due to the absence of correctness requirements and trustworthy datasets. The key idea behind metamorphic testing is to express the properties of a system in terms of the relationship between one input and its slightly metamorphosed twinned input. Extracting metamorphic properties from IRS tax publications is a tedious and time-consuming process. As a response, this paper formulates the task of generating metamorphic specifications as a translation task between properties extracted from tax documents - expressed in natural language - to a contrastive first-order logic form. We perform a systematic analysis on the potential and limitations of in-context learning with Large Language Models(LLMs) for this task, and outline a research agenda towards automating the generation of metamorphic specifications for tax preparation software",

In this paper, we explore how context-awareness can improve the performance of the current Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English-Japanese business dialogues translation, and what kind of context provides meaningful information to improve translation. As business dialogue involves complex discourse phenomena but offers scarce training resources, we adapted a pretrained mBART model, finetuning on multi-sentence dialogue data, which allows us to experiment with different contexts. We investigate the impact of larger context sizes and propose novel context tokens encoding extra-sentential information, such as speaker turn and scene type. We make use of Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) to explore how much of the context the model uses and generalise CXMI to study the impact of the extra-sentential context. Overall, we find that models leverage both preceding sentences and extra-sentential context (with CXMI increasing with context size) and we provide a more focused analysis on honorifics translation. Regarding translation quality, increased source-side context paired with scene and speaker information improves the model performance compared to previous work and our context-agnostic baselines, measured in BLEU and COMET metrics",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a promising paradigm for image classification by comparing the similarity between images and class embeddings. A critical challenge lies in crafting precise textual representations for class names. While previous studies have leveraged recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to enhance these descriptors, their outputs often suffer from ambiguity and inaccuracy. We identify two primary causes: 1) The prevalent reliance on textual interactions with LLMs, leading to a mismatch between the generated text and the visual content in VLMs' latent space - a phenomenon we term the \"explain without seeing\" dilemma. 2) The oversight of the inter-class relationships, resulting in descriptors that fail to differentiate similar classes effectively. To address these issues, we propose a novel image classification framework combining VLMs with LLMs, named Iterative Optimization with Visual Feedback. In particular, our method develops an LLM-based agent, employing an evolutionary optimization strategy to refine class descriptors. Crucially, we incorporate visual feedback from VLM classification metrics, thereby guiding the optimization process with concrete visual data. Our method leads to improving accuracy on a wide range of image classification benchmarks, with 3.47\\% average gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Based on the exceptional capacity of language understanding and generation of large language models (LLMs), we propose LLM-Attack, which aims at generating both valid and natural adversarial examples with LLMs. The method consists of two stages: word importance ranking (which searches for the most vulnerable words) and word synonym replacement (which substitutes them with their synonyms obtained from LLMs). Experimental results on the Movie Review (MR), IMDB, and Yelp Review Polarity datasets against the baseline adversarial attack models illustrate the effectiveness of LLM-Attack, and it outperforms the baselines in human and GPT-4 evaluation by a significant margin.

Our investigation reveals three notable phenomena: 1) LLM-based agents exhibit reduced robustness against malicious attacks. 2) the attacked agents could provide more nuanced responses. 3) the detection of the produced improper responses is more challenging. These insights prompt us to question the effectiveness of LLM-based attacks on agents, highlighting vulnerabilities at various levels and within different role specializations within the system/agent of LLM-based agents.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and GPT-4 have opened up new opportunities for text analysis in political science. They promise automation with better results and less programming. In this study, we evaluate LLMs on three original coding tasks of non-English political science texts, and we provide a detailed description of a general workflow for using LLMs for text coding in political science research. Our use case offers a practical guide for researchers looking to incorporate LLMs into their research on text analysis. We find that, when provided with detailed label definitions and coding examples, an LLM can be as good as or even better than a human annotator while being much faster (up to hundreds of times), considerably cheaper (costing up to 60% less than human coding), and much easier to scale to large amounts of text. Overall, LLMs present a viable option for most text coding projects",

S2A regenerates the input context to only include the relevant portions, before attending to the regenerated context to elicit the final response.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Progress in neural grammatical error correction (GEC) is hindered by the lack of annotated training data. Sufficient amounts of high-quality manually annotated data are not available, so recent research has relied on generating synthetic data, pretraining on it, and then fine-tuning on real datasets; performance gains have been achieved either by ensembling or by using huge pretrained models such as XXL-T5 as the backbone. In this work, we explore an orthogonal direction: how to use available data more efficiently. First, we propose auxiliary tasks that exploit the alignment between the original and corrected sentences, such as predicting a sequence of corrections. We formulate each task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and perform multi-task training. Second, we discover that the order of datasets used for training and even individual instances within a dataset may have important effects on the final performance, so we set out to find the best training schedule. Together, these two ideas lead to significant improvements, producing results that improve state of the art with much smaller models; in particular, we outperform the best models based on T5-XXL (11B parameters) with a BART-based model (400M parameters)",

    "title": "Igniting Language Intelligence: The Hitchhiker's Guide From Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Language Agents",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally, theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities, providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability, controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i) the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches. Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization, efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these topics.

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems such as autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and speech recognition systems are increasingly integrated into our daily lives. However, despite their utility, these AI systems are vulnerable to a wide range of attacks such as adversarial, backdoor, data poisoning, membership inference, model inversion, and model stealing attacks. In particular, numerous attacks are designed to target a particular model or system, yet their effects can spread to additional targets, referred to as transferable attacks. Although considerable efforts have been directed toward developing transferable attacks, a holistic understanding of the advancements in transferable attacks remains elusive. In this paper, we comprehensively explore learning-based attacks from the perspective of transferability, particularly within the context of cyber-physical security. We delve into different domains -- the image, text, graph, audio, and video domains -- to highlight the ubiquitous and pervasive nature of transferable attacks. This paper categorizes and reviews the architecture of existing attacks from various viewpoints: data, process, model, and system. We further examine the implications of transferable attacks in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, and large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we outline the potential research directions to encourage efforts in exploring the landscape of transferable attacks. This survey offers a holistic understanding of the prevailing transferable attacks and their impacts across different domains",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling numerous speakers, which enables expressing the overall characteristics of speakers in detail like a trained multi-speaker model without additional training on the target speaker's dataset. Although various works with similar purposes have been actively studied, their performance has not yet reached that of trained multi-speaker models due to their fundamental limitations. To overcome previous limitations, we propose effective methods for feature learning and representing target speakers' speech characteristics by discretizing the features and conditioning them to a speech synthesis model. Our method obtained a significantly higher similarity mean opinion score (SMOS) in subjective similarity evaluation than seen speakers of a best-performing multi-speaker model, even with unseen speakers. The proposed method also outperforms a zero-shot method by significant margins. Furthermore, our method shows remarkable performance in generating new artificial speakers. In addition, we demonstrate that the encoded latent features are sufficiently informative to reconstruct an original speaker's speech completely. It implies that our method can be used as a general methodology to encode and reconstruct speakers' characteristics in various tasks",

    "title": "Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "A less complex and more straightforward program is a crucial factor that enhances its maintainability and makes writing secure and bug-free programs easier. However, due to its heavy workload and the risks of breaking the working programs, programmers are reluctant to do code refactoring, and thus, it also causes the loss of potential learning experiences. To mitigate this, we demonstrate the application of using a large language model (LLM), GPT-3.5, to suggest less complex versions of the user-written Python program, aiming to encourage users to learn how to write better programs. We propose a method to leverage the prompting with few-shot examples of the LLM by selecting the best-suited code refactoring examples for each target programming problem based on the prior evaluation of prompting with the one-shot example. The quantitative evaluation shows that 95.68% of programs can be refactored by generating 10 candidates each, resulting in a 17.35% reduction in the average cyclomatic complexity and a 25.84% decrease in the average number of lines after filtering only generated programs that are semantically correct. Furthermore, the qualitative evaluation shows outstanding capability in code formatting, while unnecessary behaviors such as deleting or translating comments are also observed",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The application of LLMs to specific domains, such as biomedicine, has achieved increased attention. However, most biomedical LLMs focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation tasks. To further investigate the effectiveness of the LLMs on diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages, we present Taiyi, a bilingual (English and Chinese) fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. In this work, we first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text mining datasets across over 10 task types. Subsequently, a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition, relation extraction, text classification, question answering tasks demonstrate Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyi's considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking.

However, this approach also introduces a length bias problem, whereby DNMT suffers from significant translation quality degradation when decoding documents that are much shorter or longer than the maximum sequence length during training. %i.e., the length bias problem. To solve the length bias problem, we propose to improve the DNMT model in training method, attention mechanism, and decoding strategy. Firstly, we propose to sample the training data dynamically to ensure a more uniform distribution across different sequence lengths. Then, we introduce a length-normalized attention mechanism to aid the model in focusing on target information, mitigating the issue of attention divergence when processing longer sequences. Lastly, we propose a sliding window strategy during decoding that integrates as much context information as possible without exceeding the maximum sequence length. The experimental results indicate that our method can bring significant improvements on several open datasets, and further analysis shows that our method can significantly alleviate the length bias problem",

As images are invisible to LLMs, researchers convert images to text to engage LLMs into the visual question reasoning procedure. This leads to discrepancies between images and their textual representations presented to LLMs, which consequently impedes final reasoning performance. To fill the information gap and better leverage the reasoning capability, we design a framework that enables LLMs to proactively ask relevant questions to unveil more details in the image, along with filters for refining the generated information.

While the performance of ChatGPT in named entity recognition and relation extraction from Standard English texts is satisfactory, it remains to be seen if it can perform similarly for Malaysian English.

In this study, we assess ChatGPT's capability in extracting entities and relations from the Malaysian English News (MEN) dataset. We propose a three-step methodology referred to as \\textbf{\\textit{educate-predict-evaluate}}. The performance of ChatGPT is assessed using F1-Score across 18 unique prompt settings, which were carefully engineered for a comprehensive review. From our evaluation, we found that ChatGPT does not perform well in extracting entities from Malaysian English news articles, with the highest F1-Score of 0.497. Further analysis shows that the morphosyntactic adaptation in Malaysian English caused the limitation.

    "abstract": "Most biomedical pretrained language models are monolingual and cannot handle the growing cross-lingual requirements. The scarcity of non-English domain corpora, not to mention parallel data, poses a significant hurdle in training multilingual biomedical models. Since knowledge forms the core of domain-specific corpora and can be translated into various languages accurately, we propose a model called KBioXLM, which transforms the multilingual pretrained model XLM-R into the biomedical domain using a knowledge-anchored approach. We achieve a biomedical multilingual corpus by incorporating three granularity knowledge alignments (entity, fact, and passage levels) into monolingual corpora. Then we design three corresponding training tasks (entity masking, relation masking, and passage relation prediction) and continue training on top of the XLM-R model to enhance its domain cross-lingual ability. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we translate the English benchmarks of multiple tasks into Chinese. Experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms monolingual and multilingual pretrained models in cross-lingual zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving improvements of up to 10+ points.

However, in-domain demonstrations are not always readily available in real scenarios, leading to cross-domain in-context learning.

In this paper, we study the UDA problem under an in-context learning setting to adapt language models from the source domain to the target domain without any target labels. The core idea is to retrieve a subset of cross-domain elements that are the most similar to the query, and elicit language model to adapt in an in-context manner by learning both target domain distribution and the discriminative task signal simultaneously with the augmented cross-domain in-context examples. We devise different prompting and training strategies, accounting for different LM architectures to learn the target distribution via language modeling.

On our approach, a monolingual teacher model is trained for each language/locale, and these individual models are distilled into a single multilingual student model intended to serve all languages/locales.

This paper proposes a token-level detection method to identify adversarial prompts, leveraging the LLM's capability to predict the next token's probability. We measure the degree of the model's perplexity and incorporate neighboring token information to encourage the detection of contiguous adversarial prompt sequences.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an in-depth exploration of Meta Prompting, a novel technique that revolutionizes the way large language models (LLMs), multi-modal foundation models, and AI systems approach problem-solving and data interpretation. Meta Prompting, rooted in type theory and category theory, prioritizes the structure and syntax of information, providing a unique framework that transcends traditional content-focused methods. We delve into the formal definitions of Meta Prompting, contrasting it with Few-Shot Prompting, and highlight its applicability and superiority in various AI applications. Key to this exploration is the expansion of Meta Prompting into the realm of complex reasoning. Here, we demonstrate how this technique adeptly breaks down intricate problems into manageable sub-problems, facilitating a step-by-step, detailed approach to problem-solving. This method proves especially advantageous in terms of token efficiency and offering a fair comparison in problem-solving scenarios, standing out against few-shot example approaches. Furthermore, the paper breaks new ground by extending Meta Prompting into multi-modal foundation model settings. This extension addresses the integration of diverse data types, such as images, audio, and video, within the structured framework of Meta Prompting, highlighting both the challenges and the vast potential of this approach in handling complex, multi-faceted data (The code is available at https://github.com/meta-prompting/meta-prompting)",

In this paper we discuss the possible causes of this phenomenon by analysing both datasets and embedding space. By focusing on simple left-right positional relations, we show that this behaviour is entirely predictable, even with large-scale datasets, demonstrate that these relations can be taught using synthetic data and show that this approach can generalise well to natural images - improving the performance on left-right relations on Visual Genome Relations",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Generating high-quality summaries for chat dialogs often requires large labeled datasets. We propose a method to efficiently use unlabeled data for extractive summarization of customer-agent dialogs. In our method, we frame summarization as a question-answering problem and use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to generate pseudo-labels for a dialog. We then use these pseudo-labels to fine-tune a chat summarization model, effectively transferring knowledge from the large LLM into a smaller specialized model. We demonstrate our method on the \\tweetsumm dataset, and show that using 10\\% of the original labelled data set we can achieve 65.9/57.0/61.0 ROUGE-1/-2/-L, whereas the current state-of-the-art trained on the entire training data set obtains 65.16/55.81/64.37 ROUGE-1/-2/-L. In other words, in the worst case (i.e., ROUGE-L) we still effectively retain 94.7% of the performance while using only 10% of the data",

    "title": "Spot the Bot: Distinguishing Human-Written and Bot-Generated Texts Using Clustering and Information Theory Techniques",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "With the development of generative models like GPT-3, it is increasingly more challenging to differentiate generated texts from human-written ones. There is a large number of studies that have demonstrated good results in bot identification. However, the majority of such works depend on supervised learning methods that require labelled data and/or prior knowledge about the bot-model architecture. In this work, we propose a bot identification algorithm that is based on unsupervised learning techniques and does not depend on a large amount of labelled data. By combining findings in semantic analysis by clustering (crisp and fuzzy) and information techniques, we construct a robust model that detects a generated text for different types of bot. We find that the generated texts tend to be more chaotic while literary works are more complex. We also demonstrate that the clustering of human texts results in fuzzier clusters in comparison to the more compact and well-separated clusters of bot-generated texts",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a global pandemic as it spread to nearly every country. By mid-2021, India had introduced three vaccines: Covishield, Covaxin, and Sputnik. To ensure successful vaccination in a densely populated country like India, understanding public sentiment was crucial. Social media, particularly Reddit with over 430 million users, played a vital role in disseminating information. This study employs data mining techniques to analyze Reddit data and gauge Indian sentiments towards COVID-19 vaccines. Using Python's Text Blob library, comments are annotated to assess general sentiments. Results show that most Reddit users in India expressed neutrality about vaccination, posing a challenge for the Indian government's efforts to vaccinate a significant portion of the population",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) permeate more and more applications, an assessment of their associated security risks becomes increasingly necessary. The potential for exploitation by malicious actors, ranging from disinformation to data breaches and reputation damage, is substantial. This paper addresses a gap in current research by focusing on the security risks posed by LLMs, which extends beyond the widely covered ethical and societal implications. Our work proposes a taxonomy of security risks along the user-model communication pipeline, explicitly focusing on prompt-based attacks on LLMs. We categorize the attacks by target and attack type within a prompt-based interaction scheme. The taxonomy is reinforced with specific attack examples to showcase the real-world impact of these risks. Through this taxonomy, we aim to inform the development of robust and secure LLM applications, enhancing their safety and trustworthiness",

    "title": "ML-LMCL: Mutual Learning and Large-Margin Contrastive Learning for Improving ASR Robustness in Spoken Language Understanding",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a fundamental task in the task-oriented dialogue systems. However, the inevitable errors from automatic speech recognition (ASR) usually impair the understanding performance and lead to error propagation. Although there are some attempts to address this problem through contrastive learning, they (1) treat clean manual transcripts and ASR transcripts equally without discrimination in fine-tuning; (2) neglect the fact that the semantically similar pairs are still pushed away when applying contrastive learning; (3) suffer from the problem of Kullback-Leibler (KL) vanishing. In this paper, we propose Mutual Learning and Large-Margin Contrastive Learning (ML-LMCL), a novel framework for improving ASR robustness in SLU. Specifically, in fine-tuning, we apply mutual learning and train two SLU models on the manual transcripts and the ASR transcripts, respectively, aiming to iteratively share knowledge between these two models. We also introduce a distance polarization regularizer to avoid pushing away the intra-cluster pairs as much as possible. Moreover, we use a cyclical annealing schedule to mitigate KL vanishing issue. Experiments on three datasets show that ML-LMCL outperforms existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance",

This incremental approach significantly reduces annotation time compared to the common pairwise annotation approach and also guarantees maintaining transitivity at the cluster and hierarchy levels. Furthermore, CHAMP includes a consolidation mode, where an adjudicator can easily compare multiple cluster hierarchy annotations and resolve disagreements",

    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, existing story generation systems continue to encounter difficulties in effectively incorporating contextual and event features, which greatly influence the quality of generated narratives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel neural generation model, EtriCA, that enhances the relevance and coherence of generated stories by employing a cross-attention mechanism to map context features onto event sequences through residual mapping. This feature capturing mechanism enables our model to exploit logical relationships between events more effectively during the story generation process. To further enhance our proposed model, we employ a post-training framework for knowledge enhancement (KeEtriCA) on a large-scale book corpus. This allows EtriCA to adapt to a wider range of data samples. This results in approximately 5\\% improvement in automatic metrics and over 10\\% improvement in human evaluation. We conduct extensive experiments, including comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models, to evaluate the performance of our framework on story generation. The experimental results, encompassing both automated metrics and human assessments, demonstrate the superiority of our model over existing state-of-the-art baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of our model in leveraging context and event features to improve the quality of generated narratives",

    "title": "Towards Real-World Writing Assistance: A Chinese Character Checking Benchmark with Faked and Misspelled Characters",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Writing assistance is an application closely related to human life and is also a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) research field. Its aim is to improve the correctness and quality of input texts, with character checking being crucial in detecting and correcting wrong characters. From the perspective of the real world where handwriting occupies the vast majority, characters that humans get wrong include faked characters (i.e., untrue characters created due to writing errors) and misspelled characters (i.e., true characters used incorrectly due to spelling errors). However, existing datasets and related studies only focus on misspelled characters mainly caused by phonological or visual confusion, thereby ignoring faked characters which are more common and difficult. To break through this dilemma, we present Visual-C$^3$, a human-annotated Visual Chinese Character Checking dataset with faked and misspelled Chinese characters. To the best of our knowledge, Visual-C$^3$ is the first real-world visual and the largest human-crafted dataset for the Chinese character checking scenario. Additionally, we also propose and evaluate novel baseline methods on Visual-C$^3$. Extensive empirical results and analyses show that Visual-C$^3$ is high-quality yet challenging. The Visual-C$^3$ dataset and the baseline methods will be publicly available to facilitate further research in the community",

This paper offers a perspective on using LLMs in mental health applications. It discusses the instability of generative models for prediction and the potential for generating hallucinatory outputs, underscoring the need for ongoing audits and evaluations to maintain their reliability and dependability. The paper also distinguishes between the often interchangeable terms ``explainability'' and ``interpretability'', advocating for developing inherently interpretable methods instead of relying on potentially hallucinated self-explanations generated by LLMs. Despite the advancements in LLMs, human counselors' empathetic understanding, nuanced interpretation, and contextual awareness remain irreplaceable in the sensitive and complex realm of mental health counseling. The use of LLMs should be approached with a judicious and considerate mindset, viewing them as tools that complement human expertise rather than seeking to replace it",

    "abstract": "We study attribute control in language models through the method of Causal Average Treatment Effect (Causal ATE). Existing methods for the attribute control task in Language Models (LMs) check for the co-occurrence of words in a sentence with the attribute of interest, and control for them. However, spurious correlation of the words with the attribute in the training dataset, can cause models to hallucinate the presence of the attribute when presented with the spurious correlate during inference. We show that the simple perturbation-based method of Causal ATE removes this unintended effect. Additionally, we offer a theoretical foundation for investigating Causal ATE in the classification task, and prove that it reduces the number of false positives -- thereby mitigating the issue of unintended bias. Specifically, we ground it in the problem of toxicity mitigation, where a significant challenge lies in the inadvertent bias that often emerges towards protected groups post detoxification. We show that this unintended bias can be solved by the use of the Causal ATE metric",

    "abstract": "Effective cyber threat recognition and prevention demand comprehensible forecasting systems, as prior approaches commonly offer limited and, ultimately, unconvincing information. We introduce Simplified Plaintext Language (SPLAIN), a natural language generator that converts warning data into user-friendly cyber threat explanations. SPLAIN is designed to generate clear, actionable outputs, incorporating hierarchically organized explanatory details about input data and system functionality. Given the inputs of individual sensor-induced forecasting signals and an overall warning from a fusion module, SPLAIN queries each signal for information on contributing sensors and data signals. This collected data is processed into a coherent English explanation, encompassing forecasting, sensing, and data elements for user review. SPLAIN's template-based approach ensures consistent warning structure and vocabulary. SPLAIN's hierarchical output structure allows each threat and its components to be expanded to reveal underlying explanations on demand. Our conclusions emphasize the need for designers to specify the \"how\" and \"why\" behind cyber warnings, advocate for simple structured templates in generating consistent explanations, and recognize that direct causal links in Machine Learning approaches may not always be identifiable, requiring some explanations to focus on general methodologies, such as model and training data",

    "title": "Unmasking and Improving Data Credibility: A Study with Datasets for Training Harmless Language Models",
    "volume": "Nov",
    "abstract": "Language models have shown promise in various tasks but can be affected by undesired data during training, fine-tuning, or alignment. For example, if some unsafe conversations are wrongly annotated as safe ones, the model fine-tuned on these samples may be harmful. Therefore, the correctness of annotations, i.e., the credibility of the dataset, is important. This study focuses on the credibility of real-world datasets, including the popular benchmarks Jigsaw Civil Comments, Anthropic Harmless & Red Team, PKU BeaverTails & SafeRLHF, that can be used for training a harmless language model. Given the cost and difficulty of cleaning these datasets by humans, we introduce a systematic framework for evaluating the credibility of datasets, identifying label errors, and evaluating the influence of noisy labels in the curated language data, specifically focusing on unsafe comments and conversation classification. With the framework, we find and fix an average of 6.16% label errors in 11 datasets constructed from the above benchmarks. The data credibility and downstream learning performance can be remarkably improved by directly fixing label errors, indicating the significance of cleaning existing real-world datasets.
