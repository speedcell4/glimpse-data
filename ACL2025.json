    "title": "EcomScriptBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for E-commerce Script Planning via Step-wise Intention-Driven Product Association",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Goal-oriented script planning, or the ability to devise coherent sequences of actions toward specific goals, is commonly employed by humans to plan for typical activities. In e-commerce, customers increasingly seek LLM-based assistants to generate scripts and recommend products at each step, thereby facilitating convenient and efficient shopping experiences. However, this capability remains underexplored due to several challenges, including the inability of LLMs to simultaneously conduct script planning and product retrieval, difficulties in matching products caused by semantic discrepancies between planned actions and search queries, and a lack of methods and benchmark data for evaluation. In this paper, we step forward by formally defining the task of E-commerce Script Planning (EcomScript) as three sequential subtasks. We propose a novel framework that enables the scalable generation of product-enriched scripts by associating products with each step based on the semantic similarity between the actions and their purchase intentions. By applying our framework to real-world e-commerce data, we construct the very first large-scale EcomScript dataset, EcomScriptBench, which includes 605,229 scripts sourced from 2.4 million products. Human annotations are then conducted to provide gold labels for a sampled subset, forming an evaluation benchmark. Extensive experiments reveal that current (L)LMs face significant challenges with EcomScript tasks, even after fine-tuning, while injecting product purchase intentions improves their performance",

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning has garnered significant attention due to its broad applications in various domains, such as recommendation systems and social network analysis. Despite advancements in graph learning methods, challenges still remain in explainability when graphs are associated with semantic features. In this paper, we present GraphNarrator, the first method designed to generate natural language explanations for Graph Neural Networks. GraphNarrator employs a generative language model that maps input-output pairs to explanations reflecting the model's decision-making process. To address the lack of ground truth explanations to train the model, we propose first generating pseudo-labels that capture the model's decisions from saliency-based explanations, then using Expert Iteration to iteratively train the pseudo-label generator based on training objectives on explanation quality. The high-quality pseudo-labels are finally utilized to train an end-to-end explanation generator model. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphNarrator in producing faithful, concise, and human-preferred natural language explanations",

However, RMs are primarily trained and evaluated in English, and their capabilities in multilingual settings remain largely understudied. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of several reward models in multilingual settings. We first construct the first-of-its-kind multilingual RM evaluation benchmark, M-RewardBench, consisting of 2.87k preference instances for 23 typologically diverse languages, that tests the chat, safety, reasoning, and translation capabilities of RMs. We then rigorously evaluate a wide range of reward models on M-RewardBench, offering fresh insights into their performance across diverse languages. We identify a significant gap in RMs' performances between English and non-English languages and show that RM preferences can change substantially from one language to another. We also present several findings on how different multilingual aspects impact RM performance. Specifically, we show that the performance of RMs is improved with improved translation quality. Similarly, we demonstrate that the models exhibit better performance for high-resource languages. We release M-RewardBench dataset and the codebase in this study to facilitate a better understanding of RM evaluation in multilingual settings",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The rise of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), has raised pressing moral questions about how to reduce bias and ensure fairness at scale. Researchers have documented a sort of \"bias\" in the significant correlations between demographics (e.g., race, gender) in LLM prompts and responses, but it remains unclear how LLM fairness could be evaluated with more rigorous definitions, such as group fairness or fair representations. We analyze a variety of technical fairness frameworks and find inherent challenges in each that make the development of a fair LLM intractable. We show that each framework either does not logically extend to the general-purpose AI context or is infeasible in practice, primarily due to the large amounts of unstructured training data and the many potential combinations of human populations, use cases, and sensitive attributes. These inherent challenges would persist for general-purpose AI, including LLMs, even if empirical challenges, such as limited participatory input and limited measurement methods, were overcome. Nonetheless, fairness will remain an important type of model evaluation, and there are still promising research directions, particularly the development of standards for the responsibility of LLM developers, context-specific evaluations, and methods of iterative, participatory, and AI-assisted evaluation that could scale fairness across the diverse contexts of modern human-AI interaction",

    "title": "Intuitive Fine-Tuning: Towards Simplifying Alignment into a Single Process",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Preference Optimization (PO) are key processes for aligning Language Models (LMs) with human preferences post pre-training. While SFT excels in efficiency and PO in effectiveness, they are often combined sequentially without integrating their optimization objectives. This approach ignores the opportunities to bridge their paradigm gap and take the strengths from both. In this paper, we interpret SFT and PO with two sub-processes — *Preference Estimation* and *Transition Optimization* — defined at token level within the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This modeling shows that SFT is only a special case of PO with inferior estimation and optimization. PO estimates the model's preference by its entire generation, while SFT only scores model's subsequent predicted tokens based on prior tokens from ground truth answer. These priors deviates from model's distribution, hindering the preference estimation and transition optimization. Building on this view, we introduce **Intuitive Fine-Tuning (IFT)** to integrate SFT and PO into a single process. Through a temporal residual connection, IFT brings better estimation and optimization by capturing LMs' intuitive sense of its entire answers. But it solely relies on a single policy and the same volume of non-preference-labeled data as SFT. Our experiments show that IFT performs comparably or even superiorly to SFT and some typical PO methods across several tasks, particularly those requires generation, reasoning, and fact-following abilities. An explainable Frozen Lake game further validates the effectiveness of IFT for getting competitive policy",

We test whether these benchmarks are robust to lengthening the model outputs via a more realistic user prompt, in the commonly studied domain of gender-occupation bias, as a step towards measuring Realistic Use and Tangible Effects (i.e., RUTEd evaluations). From the current literature, we adapt three standard metrics of next-word prediction (neutrality, skew, and stereotype), and we develop analogous RUTEd evaluations in three contexts of real-world LLM use: children's bedtime stories, user personas, and English language learning exercises. We find that standard bias metrics have no significant correlation with long-form output metrics. For example, selecting the least biased model based on the standard \"trick tests\" coincides with selecting the least biased model based on longer output no more than random chance. There may not yet be evidence to justify standard benchmarks as reliable proxies of real-world biases, and we encourage further development of context-specific RUTEd evaluations",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exciting performance in listwise passage ranking. Due to the limited input length, existing methods often adopt the sliding window strategy. Such a strategy, though effective, is inefficient as it involves repetitive and serialized processing, which usually re-evaluates relevant passages multiple times. As a result, it incurs redundant API costs, which are proportional to the number of inference tokens. The development of long-context LLMs enables the full ranking of all passages within a single inference, avoiding redundant API costs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of long-context LLMs for ranking tasks in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that full ranking with long-context LLMs can deliver superior performance in the supervised fine-tuning setting with a huge efficiency improvement. Furthermore, we identify two limitations of fine-tuning the full ranking model based on existing methods: (1) sliding window strategy fails to produce a full ranking list as a training label, and (2) the language modeling loss cannot emphasize top-ranked passage IDs in the label. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new complete listwise label construction approach and a novel importance-aware learning objective for full ranking. Experiments show the superior performance of our method over baselines",

Our approach supports 8 structured languages and 29 tasks, generating data with adjustable complexity through controllable nesting and structural width. We introduce StrucText-Eval, a benchmark containing 5,800 pre-generated and annotated samples designed to evaluate how well LLMs understand and reason through structured text. StrucText-Eval is divided into two suites: a regular Test suite (3,712 samples) and a Test-Hard suite (2,088 samples), the latter emphasizing the gap between human and model performance on more complex tasks. Experimental results show that while open-source LLMs achieve a maximum accuracy of 74.9% on the standard dataset, their performance drops significantly to 45.8% on the harder dataset.

We introduce Generative Adversarial Policy Optimization (GAPO), a novel framework that combines GAN-based training dynamics with an encoder-only reward model to progressively learn and adapt to increasingly complex constraints. GAPO leverages adversarial training to automatically generate training samples of varying difficulty while utilizing the encoder-only architecture to better capture prompt-response relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate GAPO's superior performance across multiple benchmarks, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained constraint handling, where it significantly outperforms existing methods like PPO, DPO, and KTO.

Introducing the Multilingual Sensitive Questions & Answers Dataset (**MSQAD**), we collected news articles from Human Rights Watch covering 17 topics, and generated socially sensitive questions along with corresponding responses in multiple languages. We scrutinized the biases of these responses across languages and topics, employing two statistical hypothesis tests. The results showed that the null hypotheses were rejected in most cases, indicating biases arising from cross-language differences. It demonstrates that ethical biases in responses are widespread across various languages, and notably, these biases were prevalent even among different LLMs. By making the proposed MSQAD openly available, we aim to facilitate future research endeavors focused on examining cross-language biases in LLMs and their variant models",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the fact-checking studies. However, existing automated fact-checking evaluation methods rely on static datasets and classification metrics, which fail to automatically evaluate the justification production and uncover the nuanced limitations of LLMs in fact-checking. In this work, we introduce FACT-AUDIT, an agent-driven framework that adaptively and dynamically assesses LLMs' fact-checking capabilities. Leveraging importance sampling principles and multi-agent collaboration, FACT-AUDIT generates adaptive and scalable datasets, performs iterative model-centric evaluations, and updates assessments based on model-specific responses. By incorporating justification production alongside verdict prediction, this framework provides a comprehensive and evolving audit of LLMs' factual reasoning capabilities, to investigate their trustworthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FACT-AUDIT effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LLMs, providing valuable insights into model strengths and limitations in model-centric fact-checking analysis",

The trend is to build general models able to address any task.

This study proposes a theoretically grounded setup to define the notion of task and to compute the inclusion between two tasks from a statistical deficiency point of view.

    "abstract": "Federated fine-tuning for Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently gained attention due to the heavy communication overhead of transmitting large model updates. Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed as a solution, yet its application in federated learning is complicated by discordance in aggregation. Existing methods addressing this discordance often suffer from performance degradation at low ranks in heterogeneous data settings. In response, we introduce LoRA-A^2 (Low Rank Adaptation with Alternating freeze and Adaptive rank selection), which demonstrates robustness in challenging settings with low ranks and high data heterogeneity. Our experimental findings reveal that LoRA-A^2 maintains performance even under extreme heterogeneity and low rank conditions, achieving up to a 99.8% reduction in uploaded parameters compared to full fine-tuning without compromising performance. This adaptive mechanism boosts robustness and communication efficiency in federated fine-tuning, enabling the practical deployment of LLMs in resource-constrained environments",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Detecting tricky bugs in plausible programs, those that pass existing test suites yet still contain bugs, remains a significant challenge in software testing. To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80×, 2.65×, and 1.66× those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale up and gain powerful Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs) reasoning abilities, practical resource constraints drive efforts to distill these capabilities into more compact Smaller Language Models (SLMs). We find that CoTs consist mainly of simple reasoning forms, with a small proportion (4.7%) of key reasoning steps that truly impact conclusions. However, previous distillation methods typically involve supervised fine-tuning student SLMs only on correct CoTs data produced by teacher LLMs, resulting in students struggling to learn the key, instead imitating the teacher's reasoning forms and making errors or omissions in reasoning. To address these issues, drawing an analogy to human learning, where analyzing mistakes according to correct solutions often reveals the crucial steps leading to successes or failures, we propose mistakE-Driven key reasonIng step distillaTion (EDIT), a novel method that further aids SLMs learning key reasoning steps rather than mere simple fine-tuning. Firstly, to expose the crucial steps in CoTs, we carefully design specific prompts to generate dual CoTs data with similar reasoning paths but divergent conclusions. Then, we apply the minimum edit distance algorithm on the dual CoTs data to locate these key steps and optimize the likelihood on these tokens. Extensive experiments and analysis validate the effectiveness of EDIT across both in-domain(IND) and out-of-domain(OOD) benchmark reasoning datasets",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Text-based hyperbole and metaphor detection are of great significance for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, due to their semantic obscurity and expressive diversity, it is rather challenging to identify them. Existing methods mostly focus on superficial text features, ignoring the associations of hyperbole and metaphor as well as the effect of implicit emotion on perceiving these rhetorical devices. To implement these hypotheses, we propose an emotion-guided hyperbole and metaphor detection framework based on bidirectional dynamic interaction (EmoBi). Firstly, the emotion analysis module deeply mines the emotion connotations behind hyperbole and metaphor. Next, the emotion-based domain mapping module identifies the target and source domains to gain a deeper understanding of the implicit meanings of hyperbole and metaphor. Finally, the bidirectional dynamic interaction module enables the mutual promotion between hyperbole and metaphor. Meanwhile, a verification mechanism is designed to ensure detection accuracy and reliability. Experiments show that EmoBi outperforms all baseline methods on four datasets. Specifically, compared to the current SoTA, the F1 score increased by 28.1% for hyperbole detection on the TroFi dataset and 23.1% for metaphor detection on the HYPO-L dataset. These results, underpinned by in-depth analyses, underscore the effectiveness and potential of our approach for advancing hyperbole and metaphor detection",

Additionally, shallow-relevant examples selected by out-off-shelf tools hinder LLMs from capturing useful contextual information for generation. In this paper, to approach these limitations, we propose UniICL, a novel Unified ICL framework that unifies demonstration compression, demonstration selection, and final response generation. Furthermore, to avoid repeated compression of the same demonstration and boost inference efficiency, we design a tailored compression strategy that allows UniICL caching compression results into Demonstration Bank(DB).

A systematic evaluation of BERT models and LLMs against this novel benchmark reveals that both types of models approach human-level performance on easier tasks, such as sentiment analysis, but there is a significant gap in performance between machine and human on a harder task — Winograd schema challenge.

Covering three practical domains – airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations – RuleArena assesses LLMs' proficiency in handling intricate natural language instructions that demand long-context understanding, logical reasoning, and accurate mathematical computation. Two key attributes distinguish RuleArena from traditional rule-based reasoning benchmarks: (1) it extends beyond standard first-order logic representations, and (2) it is grounded in authentic, practical scenarios, providing insights into the suitability and reliability of LLMs for real-world applications. Our findings reveal several notable limitations in LLMs: (1) they struggle to identify and apply the appropriate rules, frequently becoming confused by similar but distinct regulations, (2) they cannot consistently perform accurate mathematical computations, even when they correctly identify the relevant rules, and (3) in general, they perform poorly in the benchmark. We also observe a significant performance boost when LLMs are provided with external tools for oracle math and logic operations.

However, existing methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and redundancy. First, they overlook the diversity of task difficulties, leading to unnecessarily extensive searches even for easy tasks. Second, they neglect the semantics of reasoning paths, resulting in redundant exploration of semantically identical paths. To address these limitations, we propose Semantic Exploration with Adaptive Gating (SEAG), a computationally efficient method. SEAG employs an adaptive gating mechanism that dynamically decides whether to conduct a tree search, based on the confidence level of answers from a preceding simple reasoning method. Furthermore, its tree-based exploration consolidates semantically identical reasoning steps, reducing redundant explorations while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SEAG significantly improves accuracy by 4.3% on average while requiring only 31% of computational costs compared to existing tree search-based methods on complex reasoning benchmarks including GSM8K and ARC with diverse language models such as Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral.

We show it retains LLMs' capacity in specific domains and achieves inference speedup irrespective of hardware and deep learning frameworks. We evaluated TrimLLM on LLMs of various sizes for inference; models adapted on medical, legal, and financial datasets all demonstrate 2.1 - 5.7× inference speedup on consumer GPUs and up to 3.1× speedup on A100 when compared to state-of-the-art model compression algorithms, with no loss in accuracy at 50∼ 60% model compression ratio",

Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate training data can potentially be a preferable way to improve zero or few-shot NLP tasks. However, many problems remain to be investigated for this direction. For the task of Relation Extraction (RE), we find that samples generated by directly prompting LLMs may easily have high structural similarities with each other. They tend to use a limited variety of phrasing while expressing the relation between a pair of entities. Therefore, in this paper, we study how to effectively improve the diversity of the training samples generated with LLMs for RE, while also maintaining their correctness. We first try to make the LLMs produce dissimilar samples by directly giving instructions in In-Context Learning (ICL) prompts. Then, we propose an approach to fine-tune LLMs for diversity training sample generation through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our experiments on commonly used RE datasets show that both attempts can improve the quality of the generated training data. We also find that comparing with directly performing RE with an LLM, training a non-LLM RE model with its generated samples may lead to better performance",

    "abstract": "Recent LLMs are able to generate high-quality multilingual texts, indistinguishable for humans from authentic human-written ones. Research in machine-generated text detection is however mostly focused on the English language and longer texts, such as news articles, scientific papers or student essays. Social-media texts are usually much shorter and often feature informal language, grammatical errors, or distinct linguistic items (e.g., emoticons, hashtags). There is a gap in studying the ability of existing methods in detection of such texts, reflected also in the lack of existing multilingual benchmark datasets. To fill this gap we propose the first multilingual (22 languages) and multi-platform (5 social media platforms) dataset for benchmarking machine-generated text detection in the social-media domain, called MultiSocial. It contains 472,097 texts, of which about 58k are human-written and approximately the same amount is generated by each of 7 multilingual LLMs. We use this benchmark to compare existing detection methods in zero-shot as well as fine-tuned form. Our results indicate that the fine-tuned detectors have no problem to be trained on social-media texts and that the platform selection for training matters",

    "abstract": "Automatic prompt engineering aims to enhance the generation quality of large language models (LLMs). Recent works utilize feedbacks generated from erroneous cases to guide the prompt optimization. During inference, they may further retrieve several semantically-related exemplars and concatenate them to the optimized prompts to improve the performance. However, those works only utilize the feedback at the current step, ignoring historical and unseleccted feedbacks which are potentially beneficial. Moreover, the selection of exemplars only considers the general semantic relationship and may not be optimal in terms of task performance and matching with the optimized prompt. In this work, we propose an Exemplar-Guided Reflection with Memory mechanism (ERM) to realize more efficient and accurate prompt optimization. Specifically, we design an exemplar-guided reflection mechanism where the feedback generation is additionally guided by the generated exemplars. We further build two kinds of memory to fully utilize the historical feedback information and support more effective exemplar retrieval. Empirical evaluations show our method surpasses previous state-of-the-arts with less optimization steps, i.e., improving F1 score by 10.1 on LIAR dataset, and reducing half of the optimization steps on ProTeGi",

    "abstract": "The capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality content indistinguishable by humans from human-written texts raises many concerns regarding their misuse. Previous research has shown that LLMs can be effectively misused for generating disinformation news articles following predefined narratives. Their capabilities to generate personalized (in various aspects) content have also been evaluated and mostly found usable. However, a combination of personalization and disinformation abilities of LLMs has not been comprehensively studied yet. Such a dangerous combination should trigger integrated safety filters of the LLMs, if there are some. This study fills this gap by evaluating vulnerabilities of recent open and closed LLMs, and their willingness to generate personalized disinformation news articles in English. We further explore whether the LLMs can reliably meta-evaluate the personalization quality and whether the personalization affects the generated-texts detectability. Our results demonstrate the need for stronger safety-filters and disclaimers, as those are not properly functioning in most of the evaluated LLMs. Additionally, our study revealed that the personalization actually reduces the safety-filter activations; thus effectively functioning as a jailbreak. Such behavior must be urgently addressed by LLM developers and service providers",

Next, LLM is prompted to generate natural sentences that better represent these noisy predictions than the original text. The ABSA model is then further fine-tuned on the resulting pseudo-labelled dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method across six languages and five backbone models, surpassing previous state-of-the-art translation-based approaches.

Achieving a very high level of proficiency for an LLM within a specific domain often requires extensive training with relevant corpora, which is typically accompanied by a sacrifice in performance in other domains. In this paper, we aim to \"play the dealt cards well\" and propose to fuse models that are already highly-specialized directly. The proposed fusing framework, , consists of different distinct specialists that are already sufficiently trained on different domains (we mainly focus on language, coding, and mathematics in this paper). A token-level gating mechanism is introduced to blend the specialists' outputs. A two-stage training strategy accompanied by balanced sampling is designed to ensure stability. To effectively train the fused model, we further construct a high-quality supervised instruction tuning dataset, , which includes text, code, and mathematical content. This dataset comprises approximately 300,000 instructions and covers a wide range of topics in each domain.

Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank,3. Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and4.

    "abstract": "With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code",

With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), it is essential to assess their ability to effectively comprehend these punchlines. However, existing benchmarks on punchline comprehension suffer from three major limitations: 1) language shortcuts that allow models to solely rely on text, 2) lack of question diversity, and 3) narrow focus on a specific domain of multimodal content (e.g., cartoon). To address these limitations, we introduce a multimodal **Punch**line comprehension **Bench**mark, named **PunchBench**, which is tailored for accurate and comprehensive evaluation of punchline comprehension. To enhance the evaluation accuracy, we generate synonymous and antonymous captions by modifying original captions, which mitigates the impact of shortcuts in the captions. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, PunchBench incorporates diverse question formats and image-captions from various domains. On this basis, we conduct extensive evaluations and reveal a significant gap between state-of-the-art MLLMs and humans in punchline comprehension. To improve punchline comprehension, we propose Simple-to-Complex Chain-of-Question (SC-CoQ) strategy, enabling the models to incrementally address complicated questions by first mastering simple ones.

It consists of 3,400 test cases, primarily focused on competition- and Olympiad-level math problems. Each test case contains a step-by-step solution with error location annotated by human experts. Models are required to identify the earliest step that contains an error, or conclude that all steps are correct. We conduct extensive evaluation on ProcessBench, involving two types of models: process reward models (PRMs) and critic models, where for the latter we prompt general language models to critique each solution step by step. We draw two main observations: (1) Existing PRMs typically fail to generalize to more challenging math problems beyond GSM8K and MATH. They underperform both critic models (i.e., prompted general language models) and our own trained PRM that is straightforwardly fine-tuned on the PRM800K dataset. (2) The best open-source model, QwQ-32B-Preview, has demonstrated the critique capability competitive with the proprietary model GPT-4o, despite that it still lags behind the reasoning-specialized o1-mini. We hope ProcessBench can foster future research in reasoning process assessment, paving the way toward scalable oversight of language models",

    "abstract": "Given the high computational cost of preference alignment training of large language models (LLMs), exploring efficient methods to reduce the training overhead remains an important and compelling research problem. Motivated by the observation that alignment training typically involves only small parameter changes without injecting new knowledge into models, we propose a straightforward method called ExPO (model extrapolation) to expedite LLMs' alignment with human preferences. Given a partially-trained model and its initial SFT checkpoint, ExPO improves the implicit optimization objective of alignment training by simply amplifying the parameter change based on a first-order approximation, without any additional training overhead. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that ExPO boosts a DPO model trained with only 20% steps to outperform the fully-trained one. Moreover, we show that ExPO notably improves existing open-source LLMs (ranging from 1.8B to 70B parameters) on the leading AlpacaEval 2.0 and MT-Bench benchmarks, which highlights ExPO's broader utility in efficiently enhancing LLM alignment",

Nevertheless, the gap between the distribution of current datasets from human annotations or model generations and the real-world data distribution heavily limits the capacities and potentials of models. As a result, we propose a new SFT technique, ATLANTIS, to bridge the gap. We adopt importance sampling to estimate the optimal data distribution in the real world from existing training datasets because the former is hard to sample from. Furthermore, we introduce an extra small model and reference model to estimate the sampling ratio through the probability gap between them. We evaluate our method with benchmarks in knowledge & understanding and preference aspects. The experiment results prove that ATLANTIS can bring consistent and significant improvements to models' performance. What's more, our method can be flexibly transferred among models with different structures. Our analyses demonstrate that our method is well-compatible with other SFT techniques to further enhance models' capacities and has great potential to be combined with existing training frameworks",

However, existing mental health LLMs overlook a critical issue where they do not consider the fact that different psychological counselors exhibit different personal styles, including linguistic style and therapy techniques, etc. As a result, these LLMs fail to satisfy the individual needs of clients who seek different counseling styles. To help bridge this gap, we propose PsyDT, a novel framework using LLMs to construct the Digital Twin of Psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Compared to the time-consuming and costly approach of collecting a large number of real-world counseling cases to create a specific counselor's digital twin, our framework offers a faster and more cost-effective solution. To construct PsyDT, we utilize dynamic one-shot learning by using GPT-4 to capture counselor's unique counseling style, mainly focusing on linguistic style and therapy techniques. Subsequently, using existing single-turn long-text dialogues with client's questions, GPT-4 is guided to synthesize multi-turn dialogues of specific counselor. Finally, we fine-tune the LLMs on the synthetic dataset, PsyDTCorpus, to achieve the digital twin of psychological counselor with personalized counseling style. Experimental results indicate that our proposed PsyDT framework can synthesize multi-turn dialogues that closely resemble real-world counseling cases and demonstrate better performance compared to other baselines, thereby show that our framework can effectively construct the digital twin of psychological counselor with a specific counseling style",

However, these models still face challenges on constrained writing tasks like poem generation under open-domain titles via direct generation.In response to this challenge, we introduce Block Inverse Prompting (BIPro) constrained generation framework. BIPro leverages two block inverse prompting methods, revise and rewrite. This inference scaling approach mimics the process of human text writing using block generative models. It significantly improves the zero-shot generation quality on the constrained generation task of open-domain traditional-form Chinese poem generation. Based on a less powerful block generative model GLM-10B-Chinese, poems composed via BIPro without priming or additional training outperform both much larger direct generative systems like GPT-4 or GLM-4 and domain-specific systems such as Yusheng, Shisanbai, or Baidu Poetry Helper in human evaluation by proficient poets. BIPro considerably narrows the gap between AI-generated works and short-listed human literary arts in another human evaluation, unveiling the promising potential of inference scaling in improving the quality of constrained generation.

    "abstract": "As the rapid expansion of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) for language models, concerns over the privacy of client inputs during inference or fine-tuning have correspondingly escalated. Recently, solutions have been proposed to safeguard client privacy by obfuscation techniques. However, the solutions incur notable decline in model utility and mainly focus on classification tasks, rendering them impractical for real-world applications. Moreover, recent studies reveal that these obfuscation, if not well designed, is susceptible to embedding inversion attacks (EIAs). In this paper, we devise ObfusLM, a privacy-preserving MLaaS framework for both classification and generation tasks. ObfusLM leverages a model obfuscation module to achieve privacy protection for both classification and generation tasks. Based on (k, 𝜖)-anonymity, ObfusLM includes novel obfuscation algorithms to reach provable security against EIAs. Extensive experiments show that ObfusLM outperforms existing works in utility by 10% with a nearly 80% resistance rate against EIAs",

We present GenSPP, the first interlocking-free architecture for selective rationalization that does not require any learning overhead, as the above-mentioned.

To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy increases along with the level of background knowledge",

While metric learning methods have shown promise, they rely on deterministic point embeddings that fail to capture the inherent uncertainty in the input data, in which user intentions may be imprecisely specified or open to multiple interpretations. We address this challenge by reformulating CIR through our proposed Composed Probabilistic Embedding (CoPE) framework, which represents both queries and targets as Gaussian distributions in latent space rather than fixed points. Through careful design of probabilistic distance metrics and hierarchical learning objectives, CoPE explicitly captures uncertainty at both instance and feature levels, enabling more flexible, nuanced, and robust matching that can handle polysemy and ambiguity in search intentions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoPE effectively quantifies both quality and semantic uncertainties within Composed Image Retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance on recall rate.

However, training models to handle long contexts presents significant challenges.

In this paper, we introduce Untie the Knots (UtK), a novel data augmentation strategy employed during the continue pre-training phase, designed to efficiently enable LLMs to gain long-context capabilities without the need to modify the existing data mixture. In particular, we chunk the documents, shuffle the chunks, and create a complex and knotted structure of long texts; LLMs are then trained to untie these knots and identify relevant segments within seemingly chaotic token sequences. This approach greatly improves the model's performance by accurately attending to relevant information in long context and the training efficiency is also largely increased. We conduct extensive experiments on models with 7B and 72B parameters, trained on 20 billion tokens, demonstrating that UtK achieves 75% and 84.5% accurracy on RULER at 128K context length, significantly outperforming other long context strategies.

We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation. Our method's simplicity, efficiency, and broad applicability position it as a promising solution for accurate and effective federated fine-tuning of foundation models",

    "abstract": "Innovative transformer-based language models produce contextually-aware token embeddings and have achieved state-of-the-art performance for a variety of natural language tasks, but have been shown to encode unwanted biases for downstream applications. In this paper, we evaluate the social biases encoded by transformers trained with the masked language modeling objective using proposed proxy functions within an iterative masking experiment to measure the quality of transformer models' predictions and assess the preference of MLMs towards disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We find that all models encode concerning social biases. We compare bias estimations with those produced by other evaluation methods using benchmark datasets and assess their alignment with human annotated biases. We extend previous work by evaluating social biases introduced after retraining an MLM under the masked language modeling objective and find proposed measures produce more accurate and sensitive estimations of biases based on relative preference for biased sentences between models, while other methods tend to underestimate biases after retraining on sentences biased towards disadvantaged groups",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in topic discovery, their direct application to topic modeling suffers from issues such as incomplete topic coverage, misalignment of topics, and inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose LLM-ITL, a novel LLM-in-the-loop framework that integrates LLMs with Neural Topic Models (NTMs). In LLM-ITL, global topics and document representations are learned through the NTM. Meanwhile, an LLM refines these topics using an Optimal Transport (OT)-based alignment objective, where the refinement is dynamically adjusted based on the LLM's confidence in suggesting topical words for each set of input words. With the flexibility of being integrated into many existing NTMs, the proposed approach enhances the interpretability of topics while preserving the efficiency of NTMs in learning topics and document representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM-ITL helps NTMs significantly improve their topic interpretability while maintaining the quality of document representation.

However, measuring hallucination can be challenging, as having humans verify model generations on-the-fly is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we release HALoGEN, a comprehensive hallucination benchmark consisting of: (1) 10,923 prompts for generative models spanning nine domains including programming, scientific attribution, and summarization, and (2) automatic high-precision verifiers for each use case that decompose LLM generations into atomic units, and verify each unit against a high-quality knowledge source. We use this framework to evaluate ~150,000 generations from 14 language models, finding that even the best-performing models are riddled with hallucinations (sometimes up to 86% of generated atomic facts depending on the domain). We further define a novel error classification for LLM hallucinations based on whether they likely stem from incorrect recollection of training data (Type A errors), or incorrect knowledge in training data (Type B errors), or are fabrication (Type C errors).

The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not propagate their own labels back to themselves.

However, existing attack methods typically adapt the extraction strategies originally developed for deep neural networks (DNNs). They neglect the underlying inconsistency between the training tasks of MEA and LLM alignment, leading to suboptimal attack performance. To tackle this issue, we propose Locality Reinforced Distillation (LoRD), a novel model extraction algorithm specifically designed for LLMs. In particular, LoRD employs a newly defined policy-gradient-style training task that utilizes the responses of victim model as the signal to guide the crafting of preference for the local model. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that I) The convergence procedure of LoRD in model extraction is consistent with the alignment procedure of LLMs, and II) LoRD can reduce query complexity while mitigating watermark protection through our exploration-based stealing.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), concerns about their ‌potential misuse and abuse have grown rapidly. Prior research has exposed VLMs' vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, where carefully crafted inputs can lead the model to produce content that violates ethical and legal standards. However, current jailbreak methods often fail against cutting-edge models such as GPT-4o. We attribute this to the over-exposure of harmful content and the absence of stealthy malicious guidance. In this work, we introduce a novel jailbreak framework: Multi-Modal Linkage (MML) Attack. Drawing inspiration from cryptography, MML employs an encryption-decryption process across text and image modalities to mitigate the over-exposure of malicious information. To covertly align the model's output with harmful objectives, MML leverages a technique we term evil alignment, framing the attack within the narrative context of a video game development scenario. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MML. Specifically, MML jailbreaks GPT-4o with attack success rates of 99.40% on SafeBench, 98.81% on MM-SafeBench, and 99.07% on HADES-Dataset.

Through systematic evaluation across arithmetic, domain-specific knowledge, and high-stakes medical decision tasks, we demonstrate that post-training aligned models often default to selecting invalid options, while base models exhibit improved refusal capabilities that scale with model size. Our analysis reveals that alignment techniques, though intended to enhance helpfulness, can inadvertently impair models' reflective judgment–the ability to override default behaviors when faced with invalid options. We additionally conduct a parallel human study showing similar instruction-following biases, with implications for how these biases may propagate through human feedback datasets used in alignment. We provide extensive ablation studies examining the impact of model size, training techniques, and prompt engineering. Our findings highlight fundamental tensions between alignment optimization and preservation of critical reasoning capabilities, with important implications for developing more robust AI systems for real-world deployment",

Despite the overall superiority of the Decoder architecture, the gradually increasing Key-Value (KV) cache during inference has emerged as a primary efficiency bottleneck, both in aspects of memory consumption and data transfer bandwidth limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a paradigm called KV-Latent. By down-sampling the Key-Value vector dimensions into a latent space, we can significantly reduce the KV Cache footprint and improve inference speed, only with a small amount of extra training, less than 1% of pre-training takes. Besides, we enhanced the stability of Rotary Positional Embedding applied on lower-dimensional vectors by modifying its frequency sampling mechanism, avoiding noise introduced by higher frequencies while retaining position attenuation. Our experiments, including both models with Grouped Query Attention and those without, have yielded satisfactory results. Finally, we conducted comparative experiments to study the impact of separately reducing Key and Value components on model's performance. Our approach allows for the construction of more efficient language model systems, and opens the new possibility on KV Cache saving and efficient LLMs",

    "abstract": "To enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to function as conscious agents with generalizable reasoning capabilities, it is crucial that they possess the ability to ***comprehend situational changes (transitions) in distribution*** triggered by environmental factors or actions from other agents. Despite its fundamental significance, this ability remains underexplored due to the complexity of modeling infinite possible changes in an event and their associated distributions, coupled with the lack of benchmark data with situational transitions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a novel formulation of ***reasoning with distributional changes as a three-step discriminative process***, termed as ***MetAphysical ReaSoning***. We then introduce the first-ever benchmark, **MARS**, comprising three tasks corresponding to each step. These tasks systematically assess LLMs' capabilities in reasoning the plausibility of (i) changes in actions, (ii) states caused by changed actions, and (iii) situational transitions driven by changes in action. Extensive evaluations with 20 (L)LMs of varying sizes and methods indicate that all three tasks in this process pose significant challenges, even after fine-tuning.

Instead, we argue that a proper factuality evaluation dataset should test a model's ability to reason about current events by retrieving and reading related evidence. To this end, we develop a novel pipeline that leverages natural language feedback from a RAG-based detector to iteratively modify real-time news into deceptive variants that challenge LLMs. Our iterative rewrite decreases the binary classification ROC-AUC by an absolute 17.5 percent for a strong RAG-based GPT-4o detector.

To address this limitation, we propose a two-stage post-training strategy that extends the usage of short answer data for enhanced CoT reasoning. First, we augment short answers with CoT reasoning generated by GPT-4o, enhancing the VLM's CoT capabilities through fine-tuning. Second, we leverage short answers as outcome rewards for reinforcement learning. Specifically, short answers are used as correctness indicators to construct positive (correct) and negative (incorrect) pairs from model-generated reasoning chains. These pairs are then used to calibrate the model's reasoning via Direct Preference Optimization.

However, the existing LLM inference pipeline operates as an opaque process without explicit separation between knowledge retrieval and reasoning steps, making the model's decision-making process unclear and disorganized. Recent research has shown that this ambiguity will lead to issues such as knowledge forgetting, which significantly impact the reliability of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel language model inference paradigm that decomposes the complex inference process into two distinct and clear actions: (1) memory recall: which retrieves relevant knowledge in LLM, and (2) reasoning: which performs reasoning steps based on the recalled knowledge. To facilitate this decomposition, we introduce two special tokens memory and reason, guiding the model to distinguish between steps that require knowledge retrieval and those that involve reasoning. Our experiment results show that this decomposition not only improves LLMs' performance among utility benchmarks but also enhances interpretability during the inference process, enabling users to identify sources of error and refine model responses effectively.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "In e-commerce, effective product Attribute Mining (AM) is essential for improving product features and aiding consumer decisions. However, current AM methods often focus on extracting attributes from unimodal text, underutilizing multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multimodal Self-Correction Instruction Tuning (MSIT) to mine new potential attributes from both images and text with Multimodal Large Language Models. The tuning process involves two datasets: Attribute Generation Tuning Data (AGTD) and Chain-of-Thought Tuning Data (CTTD). AGTD is constructed utilizing in-context learning with a small set of seed attributes, aiding the MLLM in accurately extracting attribute-value pairs from multimodal information. To introduce explicit reasoning and improve the extraction in accuracy, we construct CTTD, which incorporates a structured 5-step reasoning process for self-correction. Finally, we employ a 3-stage inference process to filter out redundant attributes and sequentially validate each generated attribute. Comprehensive experimental results on two datasets show that MSIT outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code and data in the near future",

    "title": "Normalized AOPC: Fixing Misleading Faithfulness Metrics for Feature Attributions Explainability",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Deep neural network predictions are notoriously difficult to interpret. Feature attribution methods aim to explain these predictions by identifying the contribution of each input feature. Faithfulness, often evaluated using the area over the perturbation curve (AOPC), reflects feature attributions' accuracy in describing the internal mechanisms of deep neural networks. However, many studies rely on AOPC to compare faithfulness across different models, which we show can lead to false conclusions about models' faithfulness. Specifically, we find that AOPC is sensitive to variations in the model, resulting in unreliable cross-model comparisons. Moreover, AOPC scores are difficult to interpret in isolation without knowing the model-specific lower and upper limits. To address these issues, we propose a normalization approach, Normalized AOPC (NAOPC), enabling consistent cross-model evaluations and more meaningful interpretation of individual scores. Our experiments demonstrate that this normalization can radically change AOPC results, questioning the conclusions of earlier studies and offering a more robust framework for assessing feature attribution faithfulness.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Expressive zero-shot voice conversion (VC) is a critical and challenging task that aims to transform the source timbre into an arbitrary unseen speaker while preserving the original content and expressive qualities. Despite recent progress in zero-shot VC, there remains considerable potential for improvements in speaker similarity and speech naturalness. Moreover, existing zero-shot VC systems struggle to fully reproduce paralinguistic information in highly expressive speech, such as breathing, crying, and emotional nuances, limiting their practical applicability. To address these issues, we propose Takin-VC, a novel expressive zero-shot VC framework via adaptive hybrid content encoding and memory-augmented context-aware timbre modeling. Specifically, we introduce an innovative hybrid content encoder that incorporates an adaptive fusion module, capable of effectively integrating quantized features of the pre-trained WavLM and HybridFormer in an implicit manner, so as to extract precise linguistic features while enriching paralinguistic elements. For timbre modeling, we propose advanced memory-augmented and context-aware modules to generate high-quality target timbre features and fused representations that seamlessly align source content with target timbre. To enhance real-time performance, we advocate a conditional flow matching model to reconstruct the Mel-spectrogram of the source speech. Experimental results show that our Takin-VC consistently surpasses state-of-the-art VC systems, achieving notable improvements in terms of speech naturalness, speech expressiveness, and speaker similarity, while offering enhanced inference speed",

    "abstract": "Recent multilingual pretrained language models (mPLMs) often avoid using language embeddings – learnable vectors assigned to individual languages. However, this places a significant burden on token representations to encode all language-specific information, which may hinder language neutrality. To address this limitation, we propose Language-Script Aware Multilingual Pretraining (LangSAMP), a method that incorporates both language and script embeddings to enhance representation learning. Specifically, we integrate these embeddings into the output of the Transformer blocks before passing the final representations to the language modeling head for prediction. We apply LangSAMP to the continual pretraining of XLM-R on a highly multilingual corpus covering more than 500 languages. The resulting model consistently outperforms the baseline in zero-shot crosslingual transfer across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive analysis reveals that language and script embeddings capture language- and script-specific nuances, which benefits more language-neutral representations, proven by improved pairwise cosine similarity. In our case study, we also show that language and script embeddings can be used to select better source languages for crosslingual transfer.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Semi-structured tables, with their varied layouts and formatting artifacts, remain a major obstacle for automated data processing and analytics. To address these challenges, we propose RelationalCoder, which uniformly converts semi-structured tables into relational data, enabling smooth integration with the rich ecosystem of data processing and analytics tools. By leveraging SQL code, RelationalCoder prevents schema errors and markedly improves normalization quality across multiple relational tables.To address the challenge of large tables, we propose a new technique called Loop Reference Decoding (LRD): it identifies expandable groups—repeating regions of similar structure and semantics—and replicates each group using a concise loop over its repetitive region by referencing cell addresses, rather than regenerating each individual cell. This design substantially reduces output length from 𝒪(N × M)—proportional to the table's height (N) and width (M)—to approximately 𝒪(K), where K is the total number of unique cell types within detected expandable groups. As a result, LRD is highly scalable: the larger the input table, the greater the compression ratio. It scales seamlessly to extremely large tables, achieving output reductions of up to 100,000×.We further create the first human-labeled corpus for table transformation, created with a cost-efficient, actively supervised pipeline. Extensive experiments on HiTab and MultiHiertt show that RelationalCoder not only enables programmatic symbolic reasoning but also boosts QA accuracy—raising Llama-2 and Mistral models by more than 20%, and GPT-4o by over 4%.

Using open-ended survey data from the German Longitudinal Election Studies (GLES), we prompt different LLMs to generate synthetic public opinions reflective of German subpopulations by incorporating demographic features into the persona prompts. Our results show that Llama performs better than other LLMs at representing subpopulations, particularly when there is lower opinion diversity within those groups. Our findings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of left-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties, and matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or exclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the models' predictions.

To address these challenges, we propose a self-instructed in-context learning framework that generates reliable derived prompts, keeping semantic consistency with the original prompts. Specifically, our framework incorporates a reinforcement learning mechanism, enabling direct interaction with the response model during prompt generation to better align with human preferences. We then formulate the querying as an in-context learning task, combining responses from LLMs with derived prompts to create a contextual demonstration for the original prompt. This approach effectively enhances alignment, reduces semantic discrepancies, and activates the LLM's in-context learning ability for generating more beneficial response. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method not only generates better derived prompts but also significantly enhances LLMs' ability to deliver more effective responses, particularly for Black-Box models like GPT4",

However, due to the simplicity and convenience of providing feedback, users typically offer only basic binary signals, such as ‘thumbs-up' or ‘thumbs-down'. Most existing alignment research, on the other hand, relies on preference-based approaches that require both positive and negative responses as a pair. We propose Binary Classifier Optimization (BCO), a technique that effectively aligns LLMs using only binary feedback. BCO trains a binary classifier, where the logit serves as an implicit reward, effectively minimizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss. We demonstrate that the binary cross-entropy loss employed in classifier training acts as an upper bound for the DPO loss. Additionally, a novel reward shift technique further minimizes the gap between the losses. We validate our methodology in two settings: first, on a paired preference dataset, where our method performs on par with DPO; and second, on a Likert-5 scale annotation dataset which stems from real users' queries. Our model consistently demonstrates effective and robust alignment across four base LLMs and three different datasets, showcasing the strength of our approach to learning from binary signals",

To address the above issues, we examine LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects the outputs of harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright.

To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes diverse text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives.

Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, enhanced with flipped-channel audio. Experimental results show that our model can generate high quality binaural audios for various audio types on both simulated and real-recorded datasets. Besides, we establish an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the semantic accuracy of spatial locations through a spatial reasoning task.

    "abstract": "Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language models (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces inference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained significant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into quantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while minimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous quantization-aware PEFT methods typically apply post-training quantiation (PTQ) to pre-trained LLMs, followed by PEFT to recover accuracy loss. Meanwhile, this approach has limitations in recovering the accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with LoRA. By employing a memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory overhead, making its training cost comparable to LoRA, while preserving the advantage of QAT in producing fully quantized LLMs with high accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to quantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled fine-tuning schemes, particularly in 4-bit and 3-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as an efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA and Mistral models with instructional datasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot learning",

One practical objective for Arabic LLMs is to utilize Arabic-specific vocabulary in the tokenizer to accelerate decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to degradation of the model's learned knowledge, since many words become out-of-vocabulary (OOV) at the beginning of training. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion.Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "We investigate long-context vulnerabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) through Many-Shot Jailbreaking (MSJ). Our experiments utilize context length of up to 128K tokens. Through comprehensive analysis with various many-shot attack settings with different instruction styles, shot density, topic, and format, we reveal that context length is the primary factor determining attack effectiveness. Critically, we find that successful attacks do not require carefully crafted harmful content. Even repetitive shots or random dummy text can circumvent model safety measures, suggesting fundamental limitations in long-context processing capabilities of LLMs. The safety behavior of well-aligned models becomes increasingly inconsistent with longer contexts. These findings highlight significant safety gaps in context expansion capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for new safety mechanisms",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MMERC) aims to identify speakers' emotional states using multi-modal conversational data, significant for various domains. MMERC requires addressing emotional causes: contextual factors that influence emotions, alongside emotional evidence directly expressed in the target utterance. Existing methods primarily model general conversational dependencies, such as sequential utterance relationships or inter-speaker dynamics, but fall short in capturing diverse and detailed emotional causes, including emotional contagion, influences from others, and self-referenced or externally introduced events. To address these limitations, we propose the Evidence-Cause Attention Network for Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ECERC). ECERC integrates emotional evidence with contextual causes through five stages: Evidence Gating extracts and refines emotional evidence across modalities; Cause Encoding captures causes from conversational context; Evidence-Cause Interaction uses attention to integrate evidence with diverse causes, generating rich candidate features for emotion inference; Feature Gating adaptively weights contributions of candidate features; and Emotion Classification classifies emotions. We evaluate ECERC on two widely used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD. Experimental results show that ECERC achieves competitive performance in weighted F1-score and accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in MMERC",

However, the complexity of compilation instruction search and error resolution makes automatic compilation challenging.

CompileAgent integrates five tools and a flow-based agent strategy, enabling interaction with software artifacts for compilation instruction search and error resolution. To measure the effectiveness of our method, we design a public repo-level benchmark CompileAgentBench, and we also design two baselines for comparison by combining two compilation-friendly schemes. The performance on this benchmark shows that our method significantly improves the compilation success rate, ranging from 10% to 71%. Meanwhile, we evaluate the performance of CompileAgent under different agent strategies and verify the effectiveness of the flow-based strategy. Additionally, we emphasize the scalability of CompileAgent, further expanding its application prospects. The complete code and data are available at https://github.com/Ch3nYe/AutoCompiler",

LLMs have also been used to label data, but recent work has shown that models perform poorly when prompted with sociodemographic attributes, suggesting limited inherent sociodemographic knowledge. Here, we ask whether LLMs can be trained to be accurate sociodemographic models of annotator variation. Using a curated dataset of five tasks with standardized sociodemographics, we show that models do improve in sociodemographic prompting when trained but that this performance gain is largely due to models learning annotator-specific behaviour rather than sociodemographic behaviours. Across all tasks, our results suggest that models learn little meaningful connection between sociodemographics and annotation, raising doubts about the current use of LLMs for simulating sociodemographic variation and behaviour",

    "title": "Modular Sentence Encoders: Separating Language Specialization from Cross-Lingual Alignment",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multilingual sentence encoders (MSEs) are commonly obtained by training multilingual language models to map sentences from different languages into a shared semantic space. As such, they are subject to curse of multilinguality, a loss of monolingual representational accuracy due to parameter sharing. Another limitation of MSEs is the trade-off between different task performance: cross-lingual alignment training distorts the optimal monolingual structure of semantic spaces of individual languages, harming the utility of sentence embeddings in monolingual tasks; cross-lingual tasks, such as cross-lingual semantic similarity and zero-shot transfer for sentence classification, may also require conflicting cross-lingual alignment strategies. In this work, we address both issues by means of modular training of sentence encoders. We first train language-specific monolingual modules to mitigate negative interference between languages (i.e., the curse). We then align all non-English sentence embeddings to the English by training cross-lingual alignment adapters, preventing interference with monolingual specialization from the first step. We train the cross-lingual adapters with two different types of data to resolve the conflicting requirements of different cross-lingual tasks. Monolingual and cross-lingual results on semantic text similarity and relatedness, bitext mining and sentence classification show that our modular solution achieves better and more balanced performance across all the tasks compared to full-parameter training of monolithic multilingual sentence encoders, especially benefiting low-resource languages",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a rapidly developing field that integrates multimodal information to recognize sentiments, and existing models have made significant progress in this area. The central challenge in MSA is multimodal fusion, which is predominantly addressed by Multimodal Transformers (MulTs). Although act as the paradigm, MulTs suffer from efficiency concerns. In this work, from the perspective of efficiency optimization, we propose and prove that MulTs are hierarchical modal-wise heterogeneous graphs (HMHGs), and we introduce the graph-structured representation pattern of MulTs. Based on this pattern, we propose an Interlaced Mask (IM) mechanism to design the Graph-Structured and Interlaced-Masked Multimodal Transformer (GsiT). It is formally equivalent to MulTs which achieves an efficient weight-sharing mechanism without information disorder through IM, enabling All-Modal-In-One fusion with only 1/3 of the parameters of pure MulTs. A kernel called Decomposition is implemented to ensure avoiding additional computational overhead. Moreover, it achieves significantly higher performance than traditional MulTs. To further validate the effectiveness of GsiT itself and the HMHG concept, we integrate them into multiple state-of-the-art models and demonstrate notable performance improvements and parameter reduction on widely used MSA datasets. Experimental results also demonstrate its effectiveness on other multimodal tasks. The code is available in https://github.com/drewjin/GsiT.git",

However, existing methods often focus on specific problems, lacking a comprehensive exploration of the generalization and capability boundaries of SKP. This paper aims to evaluate and rethink the generalization capability of the SKP paradigm from four perspectives including Granularity, Transferability, Scalability, and Universality. To provide a thorough evaluation, we introduce a novel multi-granular, multi-level benchmark called SUBARU, consisting of 9 different tasks with varying levels of granularity and difficulty.

Nevertheless, how well these models inherently disambiguate word senses remains uncertain. In this work, we evaluate several encoder-only PLMs across two popular inventories (i.e. WordNet and the Oxford Dictionary of English) by analyzing their ability to separate word senses without any task-specific fine-tuning. We compute centroids of word senses and measure similarity to assess performance across different layers. Our results show that DeBERTa-v3 delivers the best performance on the task, with the middle layers (specifically the 7th and 8th layers) achieving the highest accuracy, outperforming the output layer by approximately 15 percentage points.

Specifically, we leverage LLMs' generative capabilities to produce human-readable explanations for their decisions, enabling direct comparisons between explanations for clean and poisoned samples. Our results show that backdoored models produce coherent explanations for clean inputs but diverse and logically flawed explanations for poisoned data, a pattern consistent across classification and generation tasks for different backdoor attacks. Further analysis reveals key insights into the explanation generation process. At the token level, explanation tokens associated with poisoned samples only appear in the final few transformer layers. At the sentence level, attention dynamics indicate that poisoned inputs shift attention away from the original input context during explanation generation.

However, due to systematic biases in evaluation datasets, the real-world effectiveness of these models remains unclear, particularly across geographies. We introduce HateDay, the first global hate speech dataset representative of social media settings, constructed from a random sample of all tweets posted on September 21, 2022 and covering eight languages and four English-speaking countries. Using HateDay, we uncover substantial variation in the prevalence and composition of hate speech across languages and regions. We show that evaluations on academic datasets greatly overestimate real-world detection performance, which we find is very low, especially for non-European languages. Our analysis identifies key drivers of this gap, including models' difficulty to distinguish hate from offensive speech and a mismatch between the target groups emphasized in academic datasets and those most frequently targeted in real-world settings. We argue that poor model performance makes public models ill-suited for automatic hate speech moderation and find that high moderation rates are only achievable with substantial human oversight. Our results underscore the need to evaluate detection systems on data that reflects the complexity and diversity of real-world social media",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the optimal allocation of inference compute across three key scaling factors in video vision language models: language model size, frame count, and the number of visual tokens per frame. While prior works typically focuses on optimizing model efficiency or improving performance without considering resource constraints, we instead identify optimal model configuration under fixed inference compute budgets. We conduct large-scale training sweeps and careful parametric modeling of task performance to identify the inference compute-optimal frontier. Our experiments reveal how task performance depends on scaling factors and finetuning data size, as well as how changes in data size shift the compute-optimal frontier. These findings translate to practical tips for selecting these scaling factors",

    "abstract": "Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions — a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval",

Here, we show how standard psychological questionnaires can be reformulated into natural language inference prompts, and we provide a code library to support the psychometric assessment of arbitrary models. We demonstrate, using a sample of 88 publicly available models, the existence of human-like mental health-related constructs—including anxiety, depression, and the sense of coherence—which conform with standard theories in human psychology and show similar correlations and mitigation strategies.

In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments – LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased",

This limits their suitability for long token horizon training, such as 15T tokens for Llama 3.1. In this paper, we show how to achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and data quantity by a combination of classifier ensembling, synthetic data rephrasing, and reduced reliance on heuristic filters. When training 8B parameter models for 1T tokens, using a high-quality subset of our data improves MMLU by 5.6 over DCLM, demonstrating the efficacy of our methods for boosting accuracies over a relatively short token horizon. Furthermore, our full 6.3T token dataset matches DCLM on MMLU, but contains four times more unique real tokens than DCLM. This unlocks state-of-the-art training over a long token horizon: an 8B parameter model trained for 15T tokens, of which 7.2T came from our dataset, is better than the Llama 3.1 8B model: +5 on MMLU, +3.1 on ARC-Challenge, and +0.5 on average across ten diverse tasks.

To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson 𝜌 = 0.816).

By training on these challenging and realistic pairs, our approach ensures robust and stable contrastive optimization.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming essential tools for various natural language processing tasks but often suffer from generating outdated or incorrect information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses. However, the existing RAG systems frequently struggle with the quality of retrieval documents, as irrelevant or noisy documents degrade performance, increase computational overhead, and undermine response reliability. To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2–11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions",

To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanism of learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two essential factors of their similarity measurements: 1) Integrating task-agnostic similarities of different levels between the input of exemplars and test cases; 2) Incorporating task-specific similarity between the output of exemplars and test cases. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative analysis across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on these insights, we introduce two simplified exemplar selection methods, MLSM and TTF, catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands to eliminate costly data collection.

Conversely, methods aimed at improving faithfulness and informativeness, such as model reasoning and self improvement, have not been systematically evaluated in the clinical domain. We address this gap by first performing a comprehensive benchmark and study of six advanced abstractive summarization methods across three datasets using five reference-based and reference-free metrics, with the latter specifically assessing faithfulness and informativeness. Based on its findings we then develop uMedSum, a modular hybrid framework introducing novel approaches for sequential confabulation removal and key information addition. Our work outperforms previous GPT-4-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both quantitative metrics and expert evaluations, achieving an 11.8% average improvement in dedicated faithfulness metrics over the previous SOTA. Doctors prefer uMedSum's summaries 6 times more than previous SOTA in difficult cases containing confabulations or missing information. These results highlight uMedSum's effectiveness and generalizability across various datasets and metrics, marking a significant advancement in clinical summarization. uMedSum toolkit is made available on GitHub",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The evolution of speech technology has been spurred by the rapid increase in dataset sizes. Traditional speech models generally depend on a large amount of labeled training data, which is scarce for low-resource languages. This paper presents GigaSpeech 2, a large-scale, multi-domain, multilingual speech recognition corpus. It is designed for low-resource languages and does not rely on paired speech and text data. GigaSpeech 2 comprises about 30,000 hours of automatically transcribed speech, including Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese, gathered from unlabeled YouTube videos. We also introduce an automated pipeline for data crawling, transcription, and label refinement. Specifically, this pipeline involves Whisper for initial transcription, MMS for forced alignment, and multi-dimensional filtering for data quality assurance. A modified Noisy Student Training is developed to further refine flawed pseudo labels iteratively, thereby enhancing model performance. Experimental results on our manually transcribed evaluation set and two public test sets from Common Voice and FLEURS confirm our corpus's high quality and broad applicability. Notably, ASR models trained on GigaSpeech 2 can reduce the word error rate for Thai, Indonesian, and Vietnamese on our challenging and realistic YouTube test set by 25% to 40% compared to Whisper large-v3, with merely 10% model parameters. Furthermore, our ASR models trained on GigaSpeech 2 yield superior performance compared to commercial services. We hope that our newly introduced corpus and pipeline will open a new avenue for low-resource speech recognition and significantly facilitate research in this area",

    "abstract": "Semantic parsing, which converts natural language queries into logic forms, plays a crucial role in reasoning within structured environments. However, existing methods encounter two significant challenges: reliance on extensive manually annotated datasets and limited generalization capability to unseen examples. To tackle these issues, we propose Targeted Synthetic Data Generation (Targa), a practical framework that dynamically generates high-relevance synthetic data without manual annotation. Starting from the pertinent entity and relation of a given question, we probe for the potential relevant queries through layer-wise expansion and cross-layer combination. Then, we generate corresponding natural language questions for these constructed queries to jointly serve as the synthetic demonstration for in-context learning. Experiments on multiple knowledge-based question answering (KBQA) datasets demonstrate that Targa, using only a 7B-parameter model, substantially outperforms existing non-fine-tuned methods that utilize close-sourced model, achieving notable improvements in F1 scores on GrailQA(+7.7) and KBQA-Agent(+12.2). Furthermore, Targa also exhibits superior sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization capabilities under non-I.I.D. settings",

Despite their potential, LLMs have yet to be widely used as agents on real mobile devices. The main challenge is the need for high-quality data sources. Time constraints and labor intensity often hinder human annotation. On the other hand, existing LLMs exhibit inadequate completion rates and need a robust data filtration strategy. Given these challenges, we develop a framework called AndroidGen to enhance the capabilities of LLM-based agents under data scarcity. In addition, we leverage AndroidGen to collect trajectories given human tasks and train open-source LLMs on these trajectories to develop an open-source mobile agent without manually labeled trajectories.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for data annotation, markedly reducing the labor costs associated with downstream applications. However, existing methods mostly adopt an aggressive strategy by prompting LLM to determine a single gold label for each unlabeled sample. Due to the inherent uncertainty within LLMs, they often produce incorrect labels for difficult samples, severely compromising the data quality for downstream applications. Motivated by ambiguity aversion in human behaviors, we propose a novel candidate annotation paradigm wherein large language models are encouraged to output all possible labels when incurring uncertainty. To ensure unique labels are provided for downstream tasks, we develop a teacher-student framework CanDist that distills candidate annotations with a Small Language Model (SLM). We further provide a rigorous justification demonstrating that distilling candidate annotations from the teacher LLM offers superior theoretical guarantees compared to directly using single annotations. Extensive experiments across six text classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/MingxuanXia/CanDist",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human natural languages, mainly owing to the \"scaling law\" that optimizes relationships among language modeling loss, model parameters, and pre-trained tokens. However, with the exhaustion of high-quality internet corpora and increasing computational demands, the sustainability of pre-training scaling needs to be addressed. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of post-training scaling, an emergent paradigm aiming to relieve the limitations of traditional pre-training by focusing on the alignment phase, which traditionally accounts for a minor fraction of the total training computation. Our survey categorizes post-training scaling into three key methodologies: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Feedback (RLxF), and Test-time Compute (TTC). We provide an in-depth analysis of the motivation behind post-training scaling, the scalable variants of these methodologies, and a comparative discussion against traditional approaches. By examining the latest advancements, identifying promising application scenarios, and highlighting unresolved issues, we seek a coherent understanding and map future research trajectories in the landscape of post-training scaling for LLMs",

A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model's computation graph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit discovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model components as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their ability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across positions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate positionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples. First, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit discovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the concept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics across examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with variable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline for schema generation and application using large language models. Our approach enables fully automated discovery of position-sensitive circuits, yielding better trade-offs between circuit size and faithfulness compared to prior work",

Nevertheless, traditional multimodel fusion approaches, which are mainly designed for triple facts under either entity-centric or relation-guided fusion schemes, fail to integrate the multimodal information with the rich context of the hyper-relational fact consisting of multiple entities and relations. Against this background, we propose **HyperFM**, a **Hyper**-relational **F**act-centric **M**ultimodal Fusion technique. It effectively captures the intricate interactions between different data modalities while accommodating the hyper-relational structure of the KG in a fact-centric manner via a customized Hypergraph Transformer. We evaluate HyperFM against a sizeable collection of baselines in link prediction tasks on two real-world KG datasets. Results show that HyperFM consistently achieves the best performance, yielding an average improvement of 6.0-6.8% over the best-performing baselines on the two datasets.

Existing efforts mitigate these issues by adding multilingual training data, but do so in a largely ad-hoc manner, lacking insight into how different training mixes tip the scale for different groups of languages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the training strategies for massively multilingual LVLMs. First, we conduct a series of multi-stage experiments spanning 13 downstream vision-language tasks and 43 languages, systematically examining: (1) the number of training languages that can be included without degrading English performance and (2) optimal language distributions of pre-training as well as (3) instruction-tuning data. Further, we (4) investigate how to improve multilingual text-in-image understanding, and introduce a new benchmark for the task. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that one can (i) include as many as 100 training languages simultaneously (ii) with as little as 25-50% of non-English data, to greatly improve multilingual performance while retaining strong English performance. We further find that (iii) including non-English OCR data in pre-training and instruction-tuning is paramount for improving multilingual text-in-image understanding.

While watermarks already exist for LLMs, they often lack flexibility and struggle with attacks such as paraphrasing. To address these issues, we propose a multi-feature method for generating watermarks that combines multiple distinct watermark features into an ensemble watermark. Concretely, we combine acrostica and sensorimotor norms with the established red-green watermark to achieve a 98% detection rate. After a paraphrasing attack, the performance remains high with 95% detection rate. In comparison, the red-green feature alone as a baseline achieves a detection rate of 49% after paraphrasing. The evaluation of all feature combinations reveals that the ensemble of all three consistently has the highest detection rate across several LLMs and watermark strength settings. Due to the flexibility of combining features in the ensemble, various requirements and trade-offs can be addressed. Additionally, the same detection function can be used without adaptations for all ensemble configurations.

In contrast, here we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs in following non-textual instruction, i.e., an adversarial image or audio, namely Con Instruction. It is a novel gray-box attack method that generates adversarial images or audio to convey specific harmful instructions to MLLMs. We also find that combining our adversarial examples with certain non-empty text inputs amplifies attack success, while appending these after malicious text has limited effects. To evaluate whether an attack is successful, we introduce a new attack response categorization (ARC) that considers the response quality and relevancy concerning the malicious instruction. The results show that Con Instruction effectively bypasses the safety mechanisms in various visual and audio-language models, including LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, across two standard benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). We show that larger models are more susceptible toCon Instruction, contrasting observations in their underlying LLMs. On the defense side, we explore various methods against our attacks and find substantial gaps among existing techniques.

Recent work addresses numerical prediction limitations of LLM fine-tuning through regression-aware fine-tuning but does not consider chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for score prediction. In this paper, we introduce TRACT (Two-stage Regression-Aware fine-tuning with CoT), which combines CoT reasoning with regression-aware training. TRACT uses a two-stage process: first, it fine-tunes the seed LLM to generate CoTs, which serve as the training data for the second stage; next, it uses these self-generated CoTs to retrain the seed LLM. The fine-tuning objective of TRACT applies CE loss for CoT reasoning and regression-aware loss for the score.

The leading model, GPT-4o, achieves an accuracy of 49.04%, underscoring substantial room for improvement. Further analysis reveals variations in tool-use strategies for various families, offering actionable insights to guide the development of more effective approaches.

    "abstract": "As the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) continue to expand, aligning these models with human values remains a significant challenge. Recent studies show that reasoning abilities contribute significantly to model safety, while integrating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures can further enhance alignment.In this work, we address a fundamental question:How to effectively incorporate reasoning abilitiesand MoE architectures into self-alignment processin LLMs?We propose Mixture of insighTful Experts (MoTE), a novel framework that synergistically combines reasoning chains and expert mixtures to improve self-alignments.From a data perspective, MoTE employs a structured reasoning chain comprising four key stages: Question Analysis, Answer Guidance, Safe Answer, and Safety Checking. This approach enhances safety through multi-step reasoning and proves effective even for smaller and less powerful LLMs (e.g., 7B models). From an architectural perspective, MoTE adopts a multi-LoRA framework with step-level routing, where each expert is dedicated to a specific reasoning step. This design eliminates the need for balance losses, ensures stable training, and supports adaptive inference lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that MoTE significantly improves model safety, jailbreak resistance, and over-refusal capabilities, achieving performance comparable to OpenAI's state-of-the-art o1 model",

    "title": "MAPS: Motivation-Aware Personalized Search via LLM-Driven Consultation Alignment",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, significant challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes, including decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, this paper proposes a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle. The framework consists of three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver, in which symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. Experimental results demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios",

Continual training with long-context data becomes the de-facto method to equip LLMs with the ability to process long inputs.

To address this issue, we propose a Long-context data selection framework with Attention-based Dependency Measurement (LADM), which can efficiently identify high-quality long-context data from a large-scale, multi-domain pre-training corpus. LADM leverages the retrieval capabilities of the attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies, ensuring a comprehensive quality measurement of long-context data.

    "abstract": "Machine-generated Text (MGT) detection is crucial for regulating and attributing online texts. While the existing MGT detectors achieve strong performance, they remain vulnerable to simple perturbations and adversarial attacks. To build an effective defense against malicious perturbations, we view MGT detection from a threat modeling perspective, that is, analyzing the model's vulnerability from an adversary's point of view and exploring effective mitigations. To this end, we introduce an adversarial framework for training a robust MGT detector, named GREedy Adversary PromoTed DefendER (GREATER). The GREATER consists of two key components: an adversary GREATER-A and a detector GREATER-D. The GREATER-D learns to defend against the adversarial attack from GREATER-A and generalizes the defense to other attacks. GREATER-A identifies and perturbs the critical tokens in embedding space, along with greedy search and pruning to generate stealthy and disruptive adversarial examples. Besides, we update the GREATER-A and GREATER-D synchronously, encouraging the GREATER-D to generalize its defense to different attacks and varying attack intensities. Our experimental results across 10 text perturbation strategies and 6 adversarial attacks show that our GREATER-D reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 0.67% compared with SOTA defense methods while our GREATER-A is demonstrated to be more effective and efficient than SOTA attack approaches.

DeRTa incorporates two novel components: (1) Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with Harmful Response Prefix, which trains models to recognize and avoid unsafe content by appending a segment of harmful response to the beginning of a safe response, and (2) Reinforced Transition Optimization (RTO), which equips models with the ability to transition from potential harm to safety refusal consistently throughout the harmful response sequence. Our empirical evaluation, conducted using LLaMA3 and Mistral model families across six attack scenarios, demonstrates that our method not only improves model safety without compromising performance but also surpasses baseline methods in defending against attacks",

    "abstract": "Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a promising direction, as LLMs have demonstrated stronger semantic understanding capabilities. Previous studies typically focus on prompt engineering to elicit sentence embeddings from LLMs by prompting the model to encode sentence information into the embedding of the last token.However, LLMs are mostly decoder-only models with causal attention and the earlier tokens in the sentence cannot attend to the latter tokens, resulting in biased encoding of sentence information and cascading effects on the final decoded token.To this end, we propose a novel Token Prepending (TP) technique that prepends each layer's decoded sentence embedding to the beginning of the sentence in the next layer's input, allowing earlier tokens to attend to the complete sentence information under the causal attention mechanism.The proposed TP technique is a plug-and-play and training-free technique, which means it can be seamlessly integrated with various prompt-based sentence embedding methods and autoregressive LLMs.Extensive experiments on various Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our proposed TP technique can significantly improve the performance of existing prompt-based sentence embedding methods across different LLMs, while incurring negligible additional inference cost",

    "abstract": "Evaluating Video Language Models (VLMs) is a challenging task. Due to its transparency, Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA) is widely used to measure the performance of these models through accuracy. However, existing MCQA benchmarks fail to capture the full reasoning capabilities of VLMs due to selection bias, when models disproportionately favor certain answer options based on positional patterns observed during training. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of several VLM architectures across major datasets designed to assess complex video-focused reasoning. We identify where the bias is most pronounced and demonstrate to what extent model responses reflect genuine understanding of video content and related questions, as opposed to reliance on arbitrary patterns or superficial cues, such as answer position. By decomposing the MCQA task and adapting fairness bias metrics to VLMs, we introduce a post-processing calibration technique BOLD to balance this bias. Our results show that reducing selection bias improves not only debiasing metrics but also overall model performance, including Accuracy and F1 Mean score. Our method, by suppressing \"blind guessing\", offers a more cost- and time-effective approach to mitigating selection bias compared to existing techniques.

However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs).

We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively.

This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes.

Many complex scientific research questions have multiple plausible answers, each supported by evidence of varying strength. However, existing language models lack the capability to quantitatively and faithfully compare answer plausibility in terms of supporting evidence. To address this, we introduce Retrieve to Explain (R2E), a retrieval-based model that scores and ranks all possible answers to a research question based on evidence retrieved from a document corpus. The architecture represents each answer only in terms of its supporting evidence, with the answer itself masked. This allows us to extend feature attribution methods such as Shapley values, to transparently attribute answer scores to supporting evidence at inference time. The architecture also allows incorporation of new evidence without retraining, including non-textual data modalities templated into natural language. We developed R2E for the challenging scientific discovery task of drug target identification, a human-in-the-loop process where failures are extremely costly and explainability paramount. When predicting whether drug targets will subsequently be confirmed as efficacious in clinical trials, R2E not only matches non-explainable literature-based models but also surpasses a genetics-based target identification approach used throughout the pharmaceutical industry",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "LLMs are aligned to follow input instructions by learning which of two responses users prefer for a prompt. However, such preference data do not convey *why* users prefer responses that are chosen or rejected, so LLMs trained on these datasets cannot tailor responses to varied user needs. To surface these parameters of personalization, we apply *abductive reasoning* to preference data, inferring needs and interests of users, i.e., personas, that may prefer either response. We test this idea in two steps: **Persona Inference (PI)**—abductively inferring personas of users who prefer chosen or rejected outputs—and **Persona Tailoring (PT)**—training models to tailor outputs to personas from PI. We show: 1) LLMs infer personas accurately explaining why different users may prefer *both* chosen or rejected outputs; 2) Training on preference data augmented with PI personas via PT boosts personalization and generalizes to supporting user-written personas; and 3) Rejected response personas form harder personalization evaluations, showing PT better aids users with uncommon preferences versus typical alignment methods. We argue for an abductive view of preferences for personalization, asking not only which response is better but when, why, and for whom",

We first reveal flaws in MCQA's format, as it struggles to: 1) test generation/subjectivity; 2) match LLM use cases; and 3) fully test knowledge. We instead advocate for generative formats based on human testing—where LLMs construct and explain answers—better capturing user needs and knowledge while remaining easy to score. We then show even when MCQA is a useful format, its datasets suffer from: leakage; unanswerability; shortcuts; and saturation. In each issue, we give fixes from education, like rubrics to guide MCQ writing; scoring methods to bridle guessing; and Item Response Theory to build harder MCQs. Lastly, we discuss LLM errors in MCQA—robustness, biases, and unfaithful explanations—showing how our prior solutions better measure or address these issues. While we do not need to desert MCQA, we encourage more efforts in refining the task based on educational testing, advancing evaluations",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is widely used in task-oriented dialogue systems to optimize dialogue policy, but it struggles to balance exploration and exploitation due to the high dimensionality of state and action spaces. This challenge often results in local optima or poor convergence. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been proven to effectively explore the solution space of neural networks by maintaining population diversity. Inspired by this, we innovatively combine the global search capabilities of EA with the local optimization of DRL to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation. Nevertheless, the inherent flexibility of natural language in dialogue tasks complicates this direct integration, leading to prolonged evolutionary times. Thus, we further propose an elite individual injection mechanism to enhance EA's search efficiency by adaptively introducing best-performing individuals into the population. Experiments across four datasets show that our approach significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, boosting performance. Moreover, the effectiveness of the EII mechanism in reducing exploration time has been demonstrated, achieving an efficient integration of EA and DRL on task-oriented dialogue policy tasks",

    "abstract": "Structured representations, exemplified by Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), have long been pivotal in computational linguistics. However, their role remains ambiguous in the Large Language Models (LLMs) era. Initial attempts to integrate structured representation into LLMs via a zero-shot setting yielded inferior performance. We hypothesize that such a decline stems from the structure information being passed into LLMs in a code format unfamiliar to LLMs' training corpora. Consequently, we propose SR-LLM, an innovative framework with two settings to explore a superior way of integrating structured representation with LLMs from training-free and training-dependent perspectives. The former integrates structural information through natural language descriptions in LLM prompts, whereas its counterpart augments the model's inference capability through fine-tuning on linguistically described structured representations. Performance improvements were observed in widely downstream datasets, with particularly notable gains of 3.17% and 12.38% in PAWS. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the pioneering demonstration that leveraging structural representations can substantially enhance LLMs' inference capability. We hope that our work sheds light and encourages future research to enhance the reasoning and interoperability of LLMs by structure data",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) are prevalent in various real-world applications, including academic networks, e-commerce platforms, and social networks. Effective learning on TAGs requires leveraging both textual node features and structural graph information. While language models (LMs) excel at processing text and graph neural networks (GNNs) effectively capture relational structures, their direct integration is computationally prohibitive due to the high cost of text and graph representation learning. Existing approaches address this challenge by adopting a two-step pipeline where LMs generate fixed node embeddings, which are then used for GNN training. However, this method neglects the interaction between textual and structural information, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose SKETCH (Semantic Knowledge and Structure Enrichment), a novel framework that decouples node aggregation from graph convolution and integrates it into the text representation learning process. SKETCH enhances TAG learning by incorporating two key aggregation mechanisms: (1) Semantic aggregation, which retrieves semantically relevant node texts for contextual enrichment, and (2) Structural aggregation, which propagates textual features beyond immediate neighbors to capture broader graph relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SKETCH outperforms state-of-the-art TAG learning methods while requiring fewer computational resources. By enabling a more efficient and effective fusion of textual and structural information, SKETCH provides new insights into TAG problems and offers a practical solution for real applications",

    "abstract": "Extracting sentence embeddings from large language models (LLMs) is a practical direction, as it requires neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Previous studies usually focus on prompt engineering to guide LLMs to encode the core semantic information of the sentence into the embedding of the last token. However, the last token in these methods still encodes an excess of non-essential information, such as stop words, limiting its encoding capacity. To this end, we propose a Contrastive Prompting (CP) technique that introduces an extra auxiliary prompt to elicit better sentence embedding. By contrasting with the auxiliary prompt, CP can steer existing prompts to encode the core semantics of the sentence, rather than non-essential information. CP is a plug-and-play inference-time intervention method that can be combined with various prompt-based methods. Extensive experiments on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) tasks and downstream classification tasks demonstrate that our method can improve the performance of existing prompt-based methods across different LLMs",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made substantial progress in integrating large language models (LLMs) with visual inputs, enabling advanced multimodal reasoning. Despite their success, a persistent challenge is hallucination—where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual content—undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on alignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at the generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an emphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce Vision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of attention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal the presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual information; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns is closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose Vision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate hallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining high efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.

We study moral differences in associations from western English-speaking communities and LLMs trained predominantly on English data. First, we create a large dataset of LLM-generated word associations, resembling an existing data set of human word associations.

We first conduct a preliminary experiment using GLM-4-9B as the teacher LLM to distill a 1.9B parameter student LLM, validating the effectiveness of PD. Considering the key impact factors of distillation, we systematically explore the design space of pre-training distillation across four aspects: logits processing, loss selection, scaling law, and offline or online logits. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space of pre-training distillation and find better configurations and interesting conclusions, such as larger student LLMs generally benefiting more from pre-training distillation, while a larger teacher LLM does not necessarily guarantee better results.

    "abstract": "Non-collaborative dialogue involves two participants with conflicting interests engaging in a multi-round dialogue to achieve their own goals. Strategy planning is the key to guiding both participants towards a consensus. Most LLMs-based methods use stimulus prompts or external strategy planners for strategy planning. However, stimulus prompts fail to teach LLMs to plan dialogue strategies explicitly. Moreover, training external strategy planners doesn't fully account for adversarial interactions, thereby limiting their effectiveness against tough resisters. In this paper, to mitigate the above issues, we propose GAIA, a Game-based Adversarial self-play InterActive training paradigm, which constructs an adversarial two-player (a persuader and a resister) zero-sum game and guides the game to approximate Nash Equilibrium (NE) via reinforcement learning (RL) for the non-collaborative dialogues. First, we design a Chain-of-Mind prompt to reason the resister's dialogue act step-by-step to plan the persuasive strategies. Secondly, to adversarially improve the persuader, we construct diverse resistant planners and theoretically improve the persuader's optimal lower bound. Finally, we iteratively optimise their policies via adversarial self-play interactive RL and design an 𝜖-NE verification algorithm to approximate the game's NE. Experiments on three datasets show that our model obtains state-of-the-art performance",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Understanding the inner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a critical research frontier. Prior research has shown that a single LLM's concept representations can be captured as steering vectors (SVs), enabling the control of LLM behavior (e.g., towards generating harmful content). Our work takes a novel approach by exploring the intricate relationships between concept representations across different LLMs, drawing an intriguing parallel to Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In particular, we introduce a linear transformation method to bridge these representations and present three key findings: 1) Concept representations across different LLMs can be effectively aligned using simple linear transformations, enabling efficient cross-model transfer and behavioral control via SVs. 2) This linear transformation generalizes across concepts, facilitating alignment and control of SVs representing different concepts across LLMs. 3) A weak-to-strong transferability exists between LLM concept representations, whereby SVs extracted from smaller LLMs can effectively control the behavior of larger LLMs. Our code is provided in the supplementary file and will be openly released",

    "abstract": "Though significant advancements have been achieved in developing long-context large language models (LLMs), the compromised quality of LLM-synthesized data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often affects the long-context performance of SFT models and leads to inherent limitations. In principle, reinforcement learning (RL) with appropriate reward signals can further enhance models' capacities. However, how to obtain reliable rewards in long-context scenarios remains unexplored. To this end, we propose LongReward, a novel method that utilizes an off-the-shelf LLM to provide rewards for long-context model responses from four human-valued dimensions: helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness, each with a carefully designed assessment pipeline. By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to effectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that LongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance but also enhances their ability to follow short instructions. We also find that long-context DPO with LongReward and conventional short-context DPO can be used together without hurting either one's performance",

Existing works neglect to measure the generalization of their methods to other prompt styles and different sizes of LLMs. To address this, we define a controlled experimental setting covering 12 LLMs and four prompt styles. We additionally investigate if incorporating the response agreement of multiple LLMs and an appropriate loss function can improve calibration performance. Concretely, we build Calib-n, a novel framework that trains an auxiliary model for confidence estimation that aggregates responses from multiple LLMs to capture inter-model agreement. To optimize calibration, we integrate focal and AUC surrogate losses alongside binary cross-entropy. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate that both response agreement and focal loss improve calibration from baselines. We find that few-shot prompts are the most effective for auxiliary model-based methods, and auxiliary models demonstrate robust calibration performance across accuracy variations, outperforming LLMs' internal probabilities and verbalized confidences. These insights deepen the understanding of influence factors in LLM calibration, supporting their reliable deployment in diverse applications",

However, existing studies highlight inconsistencies between automated evaluation metrics and human expert assessments. To bridge this gap, we introduce Patent-CE, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patent claims. Patent-CE includes comparative claim evaluations annotated by patent experts, focusing on five key criteria: feature completeness, conceptual clarity, terminology consistency, logical linkage, and overall quality. Additionally, we propose PatClaimEval, a novel multi-dimensional evaluation method specifically designed for patent claims.

    "abstract": "Requiring a large language model (LLM) to generate intermediary reasoning steps, known as Chain of Thought (CoT), has been shown to be an effective way of boosting performance. Previous approaches have focused on generating multiple independent CoTs, combining them through ensembling or other post-hoc strategies to enhance reasoning. In this work, we introduce a novel approach where LLMs are fine-tuned to generate a sequence of Diverse Chains of Thought (DCoT) within a single inference step, which is fundamentally different from prior work that primarily operate on parallel CoT generations. DCoT allows LLMs to gain the ability to perform within-inference refinement of reasoning chains without requiring external feedback. Through a rigorous set of experiments spanning a wide range of tasks that require various reasoning types, we show that fine-tuning on DCoT improves performance over the CoT baseline across model families and scales (1.3B to 70B). These improvements are particularly impactful for tasks with a large result state space, such as those involving numeric answers. Our work is also significant because both quantitative analyses and manual evaluations reveal the observed gains stem from the models' ability to refine an initial reasoning chain by generating a second, improved chain within the same inference step, demonstrating previously elusive self-improvement.

However, most current evaluations rely on public benchmarks, which are prone to data contamination issues that significantly compromise fairness. Previous researches have focused on constructing dynamic benchmarks to address contamination. However, continuously building new benchmarks is costly and cyclical.In this work, we aim to tackle contamination by analyzing the mechanisms of contaminated models themselves. Through our experiments, we discover that the overestimation of contaminated models is likely due to parameters acquiring shortcut solutions in training. We further propose a novel method for identifying shortcut neurons through **comparative and causal analysis**.Building on this, we introduce an evaluation method called **shortcut neuron patching** to suppress shortcut neurons. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating contamination. Additionally, our evaluation results exhibit a strong linear correlation with MixEval, a recently released trustworthy benchmark, achieving a Spearman coefficient (𝜌) exceeding 0.95. This high correlation indicates that our method closely reveals true capabilities of the models and is trustworthy.

    "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks.

We propose Token Internal Position Awareness (TIPA), a method that significantly improves models' ability to capture character positions within tokens by training them on reverse character prediction tasks using the tokenizer's vocabulary. Experiments demonstrate that TIPA enhances position prediction accuracy in LLMs, enabling more precise identification of target characters in original text.

Notably, we are the first to show that LLMs are more likely to conform when they are more uncertain in their own prediction. We further explore factors that influence conformity, such as training paradigms and input characteristics, finding that instruction-tuned models are less susceptible to conformity, while increasing the naturalness of majority tones amplifies conformity.

Utilizing PC patching, we identify LLMs apply input-label mappings in a small fraction of attention heads.

To address these limitations, we developed a novel method called set encoding. This method allows multiple pieces of text to be encoded in the same position, thereby eliminating positional bias entirely. Another promising use case for set encoding is to increase the size of the input an LLM can handle. Our experiments demonstrate that set encoding allows an LLM to solve tasks with far more tokens than without set encoding.

However, research in applied history suggests that people have difficulty finding appropriate analogies. And previous studies in the AI community have also overlooked historical analogies.

We explore retrieval and generation methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large language models (LLMs). Furthermore, we propose a self-reflection method to mitigate hallucinations and stereotypes when LLMs generate historical analogies. Through human evaluations and our specially designed automatic multi-dimensional assessment, we find that LLMs generally have a good potential for historical analogies.

    "title": "Meta-Reflection: A Feedback-Free Reflection Learning Framework",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in natural language understanding and reasoning, they often display undesirable behaviors, such as generating hallucinations and unfaithful reasoning. A prevalent strategy to mitigate these issues is the use of reflection, which refines responses through an iterative process. However, while promising, reflection heavily relies on high-quality external feedback and requires iterative multi-agent inference processes, thus hindering its practical application. In this paper, we propose Meta-Reflection, a novel feedback-free reflection mechanism that necessitates only a single inference pass without external feedback. Motivated by the human ability to remember and retrieve reflections from past experiences when encountering similar problems, Meta-Reflection integrates reflective insights into a codebook, allowing the historical insights to be stored, retrieved, and used to guide LLMs in problem-solving. To thoroughly investigate and evaluate the practicality of Meta-Reflection in real-world scenarios, we introduce an industrial e-commerce benchmark named E-commerce Customer Intent Detection. Extensive experiments conducted on both public datasets and the ECID benchmark highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approach.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can correct their self-generated responses, but a decline in accuracy after self-correction is also witnessed. To have a deeper understanding of self-correction, we endeavor to decompose, evaluate, and analyze the self-correction behaviors of LLMs. By enumerating and analyzing answer correctness before and after self-correction, we decompose the self-correction capability into confidence (being confident to correct answers) and critique (turning wrong answers to correct) capabilities, and propose two metrics from a probabilistic perspective to measure these 2 capabilities, along with another metric for overall self-correction capability evaluation. Based on our decomposition and evaluation metrics, we conduct extensive experiments and draw some empirical conclusions. For example, we find different models can exhibit distinct behaviors: some models are confident while others are more critical. We also find the trade-off between the two capabilities (i.e. improving one can lead to a decline in the other) when manipulating model self-correction behavior by prompts or in-context learning. Further, we find a simple yet efficient strategy to improve self-correction capability by transforming Supervision Fine-Tuning (SFT) data format, and our strategy outperforms vanilla SFT in both capabilities and achieves much higher accuracy after self-correction",

It is a critical and challenging task even for legal practitioners, as it requires meticulous and professional annotations and summarizations by legal experts, which are admittedly time-consuming and expensive to collect at scale. To alleviate the burden on legal experts, we propose a method for automated legal interpretation. Specifically, by emulating doctrinal legal research, we introduce a novel framework, **ATRIE**, to address Legal Concept Interpretation, a typical task in legal interpretation. **ATRIE** utilizes large language models (LLMs) to **A**u**T**omatically **R**etrieve concept-related information, **I**nterpret legal concepts, and **E**valuate generated interpretations, eliminating dependence on legal experts. ATRIE comprises a legal concept interpreter and a legal concept interpretation evaluator. The interpreter uses LLMs to retrieve relevant information from previous cases and interpret legal concepts. The evaluator uses performance changes on Legal Concept Entailment, a downstream task we propose, as a proxy of interpretation quality. Automated and multifaceted human evaluations indicate that the quality of our interpretations is comparable to those written by legal experts, with superior comprehensiveness and readability. Although there remains a slight gap in accuracy, it can already assist legal practitioners in improving the efficiency of legal interpretation",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive progress by integrating visual perception with linguistic understanding to produce contextually grounded outputs. Despite these advancements achieved, LVLMs still suffer from the hallucination problem, e.g., they tend to produce content that does not exist in the input images. Our investigation suggests that such hallucinations often stem from the deficiencies in fine-grained comprehension on the visual aspect, particularly when visual scenes exhibit appearance or semantic similarities (e.g., bicycle vs. motorcycles, baseball bat vs. baseball). In this work, we show such hallucination is naturally mitigated via a novel method called visual evidence prompting, utilizing small visual models to complement the LVLMs. While traditional visual models are not adept at interacting with humans, they excel at perceiving the fine-grained image contents. By symbolizing the professional outputs of domain-expert models as prompts, the LVLM generalists are able to refer to these evidences as visual knowledge to generate more precise answers. Detailed analysis shows that visual evidence enables models to adjust and rectify the attribution and attention on the images, reducing visual confusion by suppressing false activation while enhancing correct ones. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We hope our straightforward but insightful work enhances the comprehension of hallucination in LVLMs and offers valuable perspectives on addressing such challenges",

    "abstract": "Agents built on large language models (LLMs) have excelled in turn-by-turn human-AI collaboration but struggle with simultaneous tasks requiring real-time interaction. Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent *System 1* and *System 2* methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates *System 1* and *System 2* for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's *System 1* uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's *System 2* integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

In new domains or languages, the inefficiency of the tokenizer will slow down the training and generation of LLM. The mismatch in vocabulary also hinders deep knowledge transfer between LLMs like token-level distillation. To mitigate this gap, we propose an efficient method named **TokAlign** to replace the vocabulary of LLM from the token co-occurrences view, and further transfer the token-level knowledge between models. It first aligns the source vocabulary to the target one by learning a one-to-one mapping matrix for token IDs. Model parameters, including embeddings, are rearranged and progressively fine-tuned for the new vocabulary. Our method significantly improves multilingual text compression rates and vocabulary initialization for LLMs, decreasing the perplexity from 3.4e2 of strong baseline methods to 1.2e2 after initialization. Experimental results on models across multiple parameter scales demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of TokAlign, which costs as few as 5k steps to restore the performance of the vanilla model. After unifying vocabularies between LLMs, token-level distillation can remarkably boost (+4.4% than sentence-level distillation) the base model, costing only 235M tokens",

    "abstract": "Word-by-word language model surprisal is often used to model the incremental processing of human readers, which raises questions about how various choices in language modeling influence its predictive power. One factor that has been overlooked in cognitive modeling is the granularity of subword tokens, which explicitly encodes information about word length and frequency, and ultimately influences the quality of vector representations that are learned. This paper presents experiments that manipulate the token granularity and evaluate its impact on the ability of surprisal to account for processing difficulty of naturalistic text and garden-path constructions. Experiments with naturalistic reading times reveal a substantial influence of token granularity on surprisal, with tokens defined by a vocabulary size of 8,000 resulting in surprisal that is most predictive. In contrast, on garden-path constructions, language models trained on coarser-grained tokens generally assigned higher surprisal to critical regions, suggesting a greater sensitivity to garden-path effects than previously reported. Taken together, these results suggest a large role of token granularity on the quality of language model surprisal for cognitive modeling",

To address these challenges, we propose Segment-Level Diffusion (SLD), a framework that enhances diffusion-based text generation through text segmentation, robust representation training with adversarial and contrastive learning, and improved latent-space guidance. By segmenting long-form outputs into multiple latent representations and decoding them with an autoregressive decoder, SLD simplifies diffusion predictions and improves scalability.

    "abstract": "Multi-hop question answering (QA) involves finding multiple relevant passages and performing step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions. Previous works on multi-hop QA employ specific methods from different modeling perspectives based on large language models (LLMs), regardless of the question types. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of public multi-hop QA benchmarks, dividing the questions into four types and evaluating five types of cutting-edge methods for multi-hop QA: Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Single-step, Iterative-step, Sub-step, and Adaptive-step. We find that different types of multi-hop questions have varying degrees of sensitivity to different types of methods. Thus, we propose a Bi-levEL muLti-agEnt reasoning (BELLE) framework to address multi-hop QA by specifically focusing on the correspondence between question types and methods, where each type of method is regarded as an \"operator\" by prompting LLMs differently. The first level of BELLE includes multiple agents that debate to obtain an executive plan of combined \"operators\" to address the multi-hop QA task comprehensively. During the debate, in addition to the basic roles of affirmative debater, negative debater, and judge, at the second level, we further leverage fast and slow debaters to monitor whether changes in viewpoints are reasonable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BELLE significantly outperforms strong baselines in various datasets. Additionally, the model consumption of BELLE is higher cost-effectiveness than that of single models in more complex multi-hop QA scenarios",

To this end, we propose a novel framework, MARAL, which optimizes an adaptively reweighted contrastive loss to handle the class skewness and theoretically guarantees the optimal feature arrangement with maximum margin. To further mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable pseudo-labels, MARAL integrates a progressive cross-lingual adaptation strategy, which first selects reliable samples as anchors and then refines the remaining unreliable ones.

This paper introduces the Chat Game Engine (ChatGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as a ChatGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn: (1) Pscript: configure the game script segment based on the user's input; (2) Pcode: generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) Putter: interact with the user, including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on LLM to generate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three-stage training strategy following curriculum learning principles to transfer the dialogue-based LLM to our ChatGE smoothly. We construct a ChatGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives: interaction quality and code correctness",

Our analysis examines L1-driven linguistic biases, such as reference word usage and avoidance behaviors, using information-theoretic and distributional density measures. Results show that modern LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLAMA3, DeepseekV3, GPT 4o) replicate L1-dependent patterns observed in human L2 data, with distinct influences from various languages (e.g., Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin significantly affect tense agreement, and Urdu influences noun-verb collocations).

    "abstract": "Despite existing multimodal language models showing impressive performance on the video understanding task, extremely long videos still pose significant challenges to language model's context length, memory consumption, and computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a vision-language model named Sophia for long video understanding, which can efficiently handle hour-scale long videos. First, we employ a Shot-adaptive Frame Pruning technique, which naturally segments long videos into multiple camera shots, to more sharply identify and focus on the frames relevant to the query. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Attention mechanism to effectively model the long-term temporal dependencies between video frames, which achieves a time and space complexity of O(N) w.r.t. the input sequence length N while theoretically maintaining the global modeling efficiency. Experimentally, our Sophia exhibits competitive performance compared to existing video understanding baselines across various benchmarks for long video understanding with reduced time and memory consumption.

Firstly, an LLM examiner generates questions. Then, two LLM candidates engage in a multi-round peer battle based on the questions, aiming at revealing their true performance differences. Finally, a committee of LLM judges collaboratively discusses and decides the winner, reducing bias and enhancing fairness. During the peer battles, we observe intriguing scenarios where the LLM candidates display competitive behaviors and learn from the opponents. In our extensive experiments involving 15 recent LLMs, Auto-Arena shows a 92.14% correlation with human preferences, surpassing all previous expert-annotated benchmarks without any manual efforts.

We present a new Italian psycholinguistic dataset of human-generated exemplars for 187 concrete words.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer severe performance degradation when facing extremely low-bit (sub 2-bit) quantization. Several existing sub 2-bit post-training quantization (PTQ) methods utilize a mix-precision scheme by leveraging an unstructured fine-grained mask to explicitly distinguish salient weights, while which introduces an extra 1-bit or more per weight. To explore the real limit of PTQ, we propose an extremely low-bit PTQ method called PTQ1.61, which enables weight quantization to 1.61-bit for the first time. Specifically, we first introduce a one-dimensional structured mask with negligibly additional 0.0002-bit per weight based on input activations from the perspective of reducing the upper bound of quantization error to allocate corresponding salient weight channels to 4-bit. For non-salient channels binarization, an efficient block-wise scaling factors optimization framework is then presented to take implicit row-wise correlations and angular biases into account. Different from prior works that concentrate on adjusting quantization methodologies, we further propose a novel paradigm called quantization preprocessing, where we argue that transforming the weight distribution of the pretrained model before quantization can alleviate the difficulty in per-channel extremely low-bit PTQ.

Through systematic analysis of SAE activations, we identify specific latents associated with two fundamental RAG decisions: (1) context versus memory prioritization, and (2) response generation versus query rejection. Intervention experiments demonstrate that these latents enable precise control over model behavior and maintain generalizability across various experimental settings. Mechanistic analysis reveals that manipulating these latents influences model behavior by reconfiguring attention patterns of retrieval heads.

However, these methods often face challenges such as superposition and layer-wise activation variance, which limit their reliability. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) offer a more nuanced analysis by decomposing the activations of LLMs into a sparse linear combination of SAE features. We introduce a novel metric to assess the monolinguality of features obtained from SAEs, discovering that some features are strongly related to specific languages. Additionally, we show that ablating these SAE features only significantly reduces abilities in one language of LLMs, leaving others almost unaffected. Interestingly, we find some languages have multiple synergistic SAE features, and ablating them together yields greater improvement than ablating individually. Moreover, we leverage these SAE-derived language-specific features to enhance steering vectors, achieving control over the language generated by LLMs. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Aatrox103/multilingual-llm-features",

However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components demonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and even the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers, filters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.

To tackle these challenges, we introduce a training-free Analogical Replay (AnRe) reasoning framework. Our approach retrieves similar events for queries through semantic-driven clustering and builds comprehensive historical contexts using a dual history extraction module that integrates long-term and short-term history. It then uses LLMs to generate analogical reasoning examples as contextual inputs, enabling the model to deeply understand historical patterns of similar events and improve its ability to predict unknown ones.

While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose \"Shortest Majority Vote\", a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving models' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting approaches",

We propose a novel framework, LLM-enhanced Social Event Detection (LSED), which leverages the rich background knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. Specifically, LSED utilizes LLMs to formalize and disambiguate short texts by completing abbreviations and summarizing informal expressions. Furthermore, we introduce hyperbolic space embeddings, which are more suitable for natural language sentence representations, to enhance clustering performance. Extensive experiments on two challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that LSED outperforms existing SOTA models, achieving improvements in effectiveness, efficiency, and stability.

Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10% to 70% where DALL·E 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data.

Arithmetic tasks provide a controlled framework to explore these capabilities, yet performance anomalies persist, such as inconsistent effectiveness in multiplication and erratic generalization in modular addition (e.g., modulo 100 vs. 101). This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding the generalization behaviors of transformers in arithmetic tasks, focusing on length generalization. Through detailed analysis of addition, multiplication, and modular operations, we reveal that translation invariance in addition aligns with relative positional encoding for robust generalization, while base mismatch in modular operations disrupts this alignment. Experiments across GPT-family models validate our framework, confirming its ability to predict generalization behaviors. Our work highlights the importance of task structure and training data distribution for achieving data-efficient and structure-aware training, providing a systematic approach to understanding of length generalization in transformers",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), such as GPT-4o, have recently unlocked audio dialogue capabilities, enabling direct spoken exchanges with humans. The potential of LALMs broadens their applicability across a wide range of practical scenarios supported by audio dialogues. However, given these advancements, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of LALMs in the open-ended audio dialogue understanding remains absent currently. To address this gap, we propose an **A**udio **D**ialogue **U**nderstanding **Bench**mark **(ADU-Bench),** which consists of 4 benchmark datasets. They assess the open-ended audio dialogue ability for LALMs in 3 general scenarios, 12 skills, 9 multilingual languages, and 4 categories of ambiguity handling. Notably, *we firstly propose the evaluation of ambiguity handling* in audio dialogues that expresses different intentions beyond the same literal meaning of sentences, *e.g.,* ‘\"Really!?\"‘ with different intonations. In summary, ADU-Bench includes over 20,000 open-ended audio dialogues for the assessment of LALMs. Through extensive experiments conducted on 16 LALMs, our analysis reveals that existing LALMs struggle with mathematical symbols and formulas, understanding human behavior such as roleplay, comprehending multiple languages, and handling audio dialogue ambiguities from different phonetic elements, such as intonations, pause positions, and homophones.

To further enhance the performance of non-dominant languages, we propose ShifCon, a Shift-based multilingual Contrastive framework that aligns the internal forward process of other languages toward that of the dominant one. Specifically, it shifts the representations of non-dominant languages into the dominant language subspace, allowing them to access relatively rich information encoded in the model parameters. The enriched representations are then shifted back into their original language subspace before generation. Moreover, we introduce a subspace distance metric to pinpoint the optimal layer area for shifting representations and employ multilingual contrastive learning to further enhance the alignment of representations within this area. Experiments demonstrate that our ShifCon framework significantly enhances the performance of non-dominant languages, particularly for low-resource ones. Further analysis offers extra insights to verify the effectiveness of ShifCon and propel future research",

    "abstract": "Watermarking by altering token sampling probabilities based on red-green list is a promising method for tracing the origin of text generated by large language models (LLMs). However, existing watermark methods often struggle with a fundamental dilemma: improving watermark effectiveness (the detectability of the watermark) often comes at the cost of reduced text quality. This trade-off limits their practical application. To address this challenge, we first formalize the problem within a multi-objective trade-off analysis framework. Within this framework, we identify a key factor that influences the dilemma. Unlike existing methods, where watermark strength is typically treated as a fixed hyperparameter, our theoretical insights lead to the development of MorphMark—a method that adaptively adjusts the watermark strength in response to changes in the identified factor, thereby achieving an effective resolution of the dilemma. In addition, MorphMark also prioritizes flexibility since it is an model-agnostic and model-free watermark method, thereby offering a practical solution for real-world deployment, particularly in light of the rapid evolution of AI models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MorphMark achieves a superior resolution of the effectiveness-quality dilemma, while also offering greater flexibility and time and space efficiency",

Through extensive experiments, we show that while gist-based compression can achieve only slight performance loss on tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and long-document QA, it faces challenges in tasks like synthetic recall. Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way. To mitigate these issues, we propose two effective strategies: fine-grained autoencoding, which enhances the reconstruction of original token information, and segment-wise token importance estimation, which adjusts optimization based on token dependencies.

An emerging line of work demonstrates success in using the LLM as a formalizer to generate a formal representation of the planning domain in some language, such as Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). This formal representation can be deterministically solved to find a plan. We systematically evaluate this methodology while bridging some major gaps. While previous work only generates a partial PDDL representation, given templated, and therefore unrealistic environment descriptions, we generate the complete representation given descriptions of various naturalness levels. Among an array of observations critical to improve LLMs' formal planning abilities, we note that most large enough models can effectively formalize descriptions as PDDL, outperforming those directly generating plans, while being robust to lexical perturbation. As the descriptions become more natural-sounding, we observe a decrease in performance and provide detailed error analysis",

    "abstract": "Recently, using large language models (LLMs) for data augmentation has led to considerable improvements in unsupervised sentence embedding models. However, existing methods encounter two primary challenges: limited data diversity and high data noise. Current approaches often neglect fine-grained knowledge, such as entities and quantities, leading to insufficient diversity. Besides, unsupervised data frequently lacks discriminative information, and the generated synthetic samples may introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a pipeline-based data augmentation method via LLMs and introduce the Gaussian-decayed gradient-assisted Contrastive Sentence Embedding (GCSE) model to enhance unsupervised sentence embeddings. To tackle the issue of low data diversity, our pipeline utilizes knowledge graphs (KGs) to extract entities and quantities, enabling LLMs to generate more diverse samples. To address high data noise, the GCSE model uses a Gaussian-decayed function to limit the impact of false hard negative samples, enhancing the model's discriminative capability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks, using fewer data samples and smaller LLMs, demonstrating its efficiency and robustness across various models",

Although recent work on safety training with modules such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to resist jailbreaks shows promise, these approaches can inadvertently degrade a model's general utility. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play method that mitigates the impact of safety training on model utility by explicitly locating and leveraging safety-critical singular vectors, which only contribute to safety, within the model's parameter space. We quantify the safety-criticality of each singular vector as the difference of their importance for safety and utility measured by a corresponding low-rank projection. The top scored singular vectors are located as safety-critical and are used to initialize the LoRA modules within existing safety training methods in a plug-and-play manner, thereby constraining the training updates within safety-critical parameters. Additionally, we propose a dynamic rank number determination strategy to further reduce parameter overhead. Experiments on HarmBench with multiple jailbreak methods validate the effectiveness of our approach in safety training, while evaluations on several utility benchmarks demonstrate that our method successfully mitigates the adverse impact of safety training on model utility, enhancing the utility performance of the evaluated safety training baselines",

    "abstract": "Fine-grained emotion classification (FEC) aims to analyze speakers' utterances and distinguish dozens of emotions with subtle differences, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of human emotional states. However, compared to traditional coarse-grained emotion classification, two difficulties arise as the granularity of emotions becomes finer, i.e., the presence of closely confusable emotions which are hard to distinguish, and the biased performance caused by long-tailed emotions. Although addressing both difficulties is vital to FEC, previous studies have predominantly focused on dealing with only one of them. In this paper, we propose TACO, a novel triple-view framework that treats FEC as an instance-label (i.e., utterance-emotion) joint embedding learning problem to tackle both difficulties concurrently by considering three complementary views. Specifically, we design a clustering-guided contrastive loss, which incorporates clustering techniques to guide the contrastive learning process and facilitate more discriminative instance embeddings. Additionally, we introduce the emotion label description as a helpful resource to refine label embeddings and mitigate the poor performance towards under-represented (i.e., long-tailed) emotions. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed TACO achieves substantial and consistent improvements compared to other competitive baseline methods",

However, distillation can lead to model homogenization, reducing diversity among models and impairing their ability to robustly handle complex or novel tasks. These limitations underscore the need to systematically quantify the distillation process and its impact. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate and quantify model distillation. Our method addresses two key aspects: (1) Identifying identity cognition contradictions to assess discrepancies in how models perceive and represent identity-related information, and (2) Analyzing multi-granularity response similarities across models to measure the extent of homogenization. Experimental results demonstrate two key insights: (1) Well-known closed-source and open-source LLMs usually exhibit high distillation degrees, except for Claude, Doubao, and Gemini. (2) Base LLMs show higher distillation degrees compared to aligned LLMs. By offering a systematic approach to improve the transparency of LLM data distillation, we call for LLMs with more independent development and more transparent technical reports to improve LLMs' robustness and safety.

    "abstract": "This paper revisits the implementation of Load-Balancing-Loss (LBL) when training Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) models. Specifically, LBL for MoEs is defined as NE ∑i=1NE fipi, where NE is the total number of experts, fi represents the frequency of expert i being selected, and pi denotes the average gating score of the expert i. Existing MoE training frameworks usually employ the parallel training strategy so that fi and the LBL are calculated within a micro-batch and averaged across parallel groups.However, a micro-batch for training billion-scale LLMs typically contains very few sequences, leading to the micro-batch LBL being almost at the sequence level, and the router is pushed to distribute the token evenly within each sequence.Under this strict constraint, even tokens from a domain-specific sequence (e.g., code) are uniformly routed to all experts, thereby inhibiting expert specialization.In this work, we propose calculating LBL using a global-batch to loose this constraint. Because a global-batch contains much more diverse sequences than a micro-batch, which will encourage load balance at the corpus level. Specifically, we introduce an extra communication step to synchronize fi across micro-batches and then use it to calculate the LBL.Through experiments on training MoEs-based LLMs (up to 42.8B parameters and 400B tokens), we surprisingly find that the global-batch LBL strategy yields excellent performance gains in both pre-training perplexity and downstream tasks.Our analysis reveals that the global-batch LBL greatly improves the domain specialization of experts.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a crucial method for addressing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). While recent research has extended RAG models to complex noisy scenarios, these explorations often confine themselves to limited noise types and presuppose that noise is inherently detrimental to LLMs, potentially deviating from real-world retrieval environments and restricting practical applicability. In this paper, we define seven distinct noise types from a linguistic perspective and establish a Noise RAG Benchmark (NoiserBench), a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing multiple datasets and reasoning tasks. Through empirical evaluation of eight representative LLMs with diverse architectures and scales, we reveal that these noises can be further categorized into two practical groups: noise that is beneficial to LLMs (aka beneficial noise) and noise that is harmful to LLMs (aka harmful noise). While harmful noise generally impairs performance, beneficial noise may enhance several aspects of model capabilities and overall performance. Our analysis offers insights for developing robust RAG solutions and mitigating hallucinations across diverse retrieval scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/jinyangwu/NoiserBench",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in complex reasoning tasks, but their safety and robustness in reasoning processes remain unexplored, particularly in third-party platforms that facilitate user interactions via APIs. Existing attacks on LLM reasoning are constrained by specific settings or lack of imperceptibility, limiting their feasibility and generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose the Stepwise rEasoning Error Disruption (SEED) attack, which subtly injects errors into prior reasoning steps to mislead the model into producing incorrect subsequent reasoning and final answers. Unlike previous methods, SEED is compatible with zero-shot and few-shot settings, maintains the natural reasoning flow, and ensures covert execution without modifying the instruction. Extensive experiments on four datasets across four different models demonstrate SEED's effectiveness, revealing the vulnerabilities of LLMs to disruptions in reasoning processes. These findings underscore the need for greater attention to the robustness of LLM reasoning to ensure safety in practical applications.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "LLM-as-a-Judge, which generates chain-of-thought (CoT) judgments, has become a widely adopted auto-evaluation method. However, its reliability is compromised by the CoT reasoning's inability to capture comprehensive and deeper details, often leading to incomplete outcomes. Existing methods mainly rely on majority voting or criteria expansion, which is insufficient to address the limitation in CoT. We propose Crowd-based Comparative Evaluation, which introduces additional crowd responses to compare with the candidate responses, thereby exposing deeper and more comprehensive details within the candidate responses. This process effectively guides LLM-as-a-Judge to provide a more detailed CoT judgment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances evaluation reliability, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.7% across five benchmarks. Moreover, our method produces higher-quality CoTs that facilitate judge distillation and exhibit superior performance in rejection sampling for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), referred to as crowd rejection sampling, thereby enabling more efficient SFT. Our analysis confirms that CoTs generated by ours are more comprehensive and of higher quality, and evaluation accuracy improves as inference scales",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multilingual language models (MLMs) store factual knowledge across languages but often struggle to provide consistent responses to semantically equivalent prompts in different languages. While previous studies point out this cross-lingual inconsistency issue, the underlying causes remain unexplored. In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability methods to investigate cross-lingual inconsistencies in MLMs. We find that MLMs encode knowledge in a language-independent concept space through most layers, and only transition to language-specific spaces in the final layers. Failures during the language transition often result in incorrect predictions in the target language, even when the answers are correct in other languages. To mitigate this inconsistency issue, we propose a linear shortcut method that bypasses computations in the final layers, enhancing both prediction accuracy and cross-lingual consistency. Our findings shed light on the internal mechanisms of MLMs and provide a lightweight, effective strategy for producing more consistent factual outputs",

    "abstract": "Current research on the Decompose-Then-Verify paradigm for evaluating the factuality of long-form text typically treats decomposition and verification in isolation, overlooking their interactions and potential misalignment. We find that existing decomposition policies, typically hand-crafted demonstrations, do not align well with downstream verifiers in terms of atomicity—a novel metric quantifying information density—leading to suboptimal verification results. We formulate finding the optimal decomposition policy for optimal verification as a bilevel optimization problem. To approximate a solution for this strongly NP-hard problem, we propose dynamic decomposition, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages verifier feedback to learn a policy for dynamically decomposing claims to verifier-preferred atomicity. Experimental results show that dynamic decomposition outperforms existing decomposition policies, improving verification confidence by 0.07 and accuracy by 0.12 (on a 0-1 scale) on average across varying verifiers, datasets, and atomcities of input claims",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with traditional centralized fine-tuning emerges as a key technique for adapting these models to domain-specific challenges, yielding privacy risks for both model and data owners. One promising solution, called offsite-tuning (OT), is proposed to address these challenges, where a weaker emulator is compressed from the original model and further fine-tuned with adapter to enhance privacy. However, the existing OT-based methods require high computational costs and lack theoretical analysis. This paper introduces a novel OT approach based on gradient-preserving compression. By analyzing the OT problem through the lens of optimization, we propose a method that selectively applies compression techniques such as rank compression and channel pruning, preserving the gradients of fine-tuned adapters while ensuring privacy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing OT methods, both in terms of privacy protection and model performance. Our method provides a theoretical foundation for OT and offers a practical, training-free solution for offsite-tuning of large-scale LLMs",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2 accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4% vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.

This paper initially introduces a dual-metric evaluation method, comprising Boundary Clarity and Chunk Stickiness, to enable the direct quantification of chunking quality. Leveraging this assessment method, we highlight the inherent limitations of traditional and semantic chunking in handling complex contextual nuances, thereby substantiating the necessity of integrating LLMs into chunking process. To address the inherent trade-off between computational efficiency and chunking precision in LLM-based approaches, we devise the granularity-aware Mixture-of-Chunkers (MoC) framework, which consists of a three-stage processing mechanism. Notably, our objective is to guide the chunker towards generating a structured list of chunking regular expressions, which are subsequently employed to extract chunks from the original text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both our proposed metrics and the MoC framework effectively settle challenges of the chunking task, revealing the chunking kernel while enhancing the performance of the RAG system",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic preferences for certain answer choices when responding to multiple-choice questions—a behavior known as selection bias. This bias reduces the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs, limiting their usefulness in decision-critical applications. While prior work has focused on adjusting model inputs or outputs to mitigate this issue, our work takes a fundamentally different approach by identifying and removing the internal sources of bias. We introduce two methods: Bias Node Pruning (BNP), which prunes parameters that contribute to selection bias, and Auxiliary Option Injection (AOI), which introduces an additional answer choice to reduce bias in both white-box and black-box settings. To address the shortcomings of existing evaluation metrics, we propose Choice Kullback-Leibler Divergence (CKLD), a new metric that captures distributional imbalances in model predictions. Experiments on three LLMs across multiple datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently improve answer accuracy while reducing selection bias, providing a robust solution for both open- and closed-source models",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Counterfactual data augmentation, which generates minimally edited tokens to alter labels, has become a key approach to improving model robustness in natural language processing (NLP). It is usually implemented by first identifying the causal terms and then modifying these terms to create counterfactual candidates. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has effectively facilitated the task of counterfactual data augmentation. However, existing LLM-based approaches still face some challenges in 1) accurately extracting the task-specific causal terms, and 2) the quality of LLM-generated counterfacts. To address the issues, we propose a dually self-improved counterfactual data augmentation method using LLM for the Natural Language Inference (NLI) task. On the one hand, we design a self-improved strategy employing the attention distribution of the task model to identify the task-specific causal terms, which is lightweight and task-specific. On the other hand, a second self-improved strategy based on direct preference optimization is utilized to refine LLM-generated counterfacts, achieving high-quality counterfacts. Finally, a balanced loss preventing over-emphasis on augmented data is proposed to retrain the task model on the fusion of existing data and generated counterfacts. Extensive experiments on NLI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in generating high-quality counterfacts for improving task performance",

That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition",

We generated textbooks and MCQs in English and French using leading LLMs, then evaluated proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific models in a zero-shot setting. Despite the fictional content, models achieved an average score of 64%, while physicians scored only 27%. Fine-tuned medical models outperformed base models in English but not in French. Ablation and interpretability analyses revealed that models frequently relied on shallow cues, test-taking strategies, and hallucinated reasoning to identify the correct choice.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing but exhibit significant performance gaps among different languages. Most existing approaches to address these disparities rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations without incurring significant costs, we propose Inference-Time Cross-Lingual Intervention (INCLINE), a novel framework that enhances LLM performance on low-performing (source) languages by aligning their internal representations with those of high-performing (target) languages during inference. INCLINE initially learns alignment matrices using parallel sentences from source and target languages through a Least-Squares optimization, and then applies these matrices during inference to transform the low-performing language representations toward the high-performing language space. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate that INCLINE significantly improves performance across diverse tasks and languages, compared to recent strong baselines. Our analysis demonstrates that INCLINE is highly cost-effective and applicable to a wide range of applications. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line",

In contrast, small language models (SLMs) are computationally efficient but often lack the broad generalization capacity of LLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose PiFi, a novel framework that combines the strengths of both LLMs and SLMs to achieve high performance while maintaining efficiency. PiFi integrates a single frozen layer from an LLM into a SLM and fine-tunes the combined model for specific tasks, boosting performance without a significant increase in computational cost. We show that PiFi delivers consistent performance improvements across a range of natural language processing tasks, including both natural language understanding and generation.

    "abstract": "Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. To address the inconsistency issue in multilingual audio-text retrieval, we first identify two intuitive factors that contribute to inconsistency: misalignment between audio and multilingual text embeddings, and error propagation in model optimization. By systematically analyzing these factors, we derive theoretical weight error upper bounds for quantifying their effects and find that the main source of inconsistency is the data distribution error during training. This finding motivates our solution to reduce data distribution errors.We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English.

This paper studies the generalizable first-order logical reasoning ability of transformers with their *parameterized* knowledge and how to improve it. Transformers' capability of first-order reasoning is further captured by whether they can conduct first-order logical entailment, which is quantitatively measured by their performance in answering knowledge graph queries. We establish the connections between (1) two types of distribution shifts studied in out-of-distribution generalization and (2) unseen knowledge and query settings discussed in the task of knowledge graph query answering, which makes it possible to characterize the fine-grained generalizability. Results on our comprehensive dataset showed that transformers **outperform** previous methods designed particularly for this task and provided detailed empirical evidence about the impact of the input query syntax, token embedding, and transformer architectures on the reasoning capability of transformers. Interestingly, our results revealed the mismatch of positional encoding and other design choices of transformer architectures in previous practices. Motivated by this, we propose **TEGA**, a logic-aware architecture that significantly improves the performance in generalizable first-order logical entailment",

    "abstract": "Answering complex, long-context questions remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs) as it requires effective question clarifications and context retrieval. We propose Agentic Long-Context Understanding (AgenticLU), a framework designed to enhance an LLM's understanding of such queries by integrating targeted self-clarification with contextual grounding within an agentic workflow. At the core of AgenticLU is Chain-of-Clarifications (CoC), where models refine their understanding through self-generated clarification questions and corresponding contextual groundings. By scaling inference as a tree search where each node represents a CoC step, we achieve 97.8% answer recall on NarrativeQA with a search depth of up to three and a branching factor of eight. To amortize the high cost of this search process to training, we leverage the preference pairs for each step obtained by the CoC workflow and perform two-stage model finetuning: (1) supervised finetuning to learn effective decomposition strategies, and (2) direct preference optimization to enhance reasoning quality. This enables AgenticLU models to generate clarifications and retrieve relevant context effectively and efficiently in a single inference pass. Extensive experiments across seven long-context tasks demonstrate that AgenticLU significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompting methods and specialized long-context LLMs, achieving robust multi-hop reasoning while sustaining consistent performance as context length grows",

Our research investigates the relationship between the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of hallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant variance during training. To address this, we propose Sensitivity Dropout (SenD), a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucination variance. SenD improves test-time reliability of Pythia and Meta's Llama models by up to 17% and enhances factual accuracy in Wikipedia, Medical, Legal, and Coding domains without affecting downstream task performance",

    "abstract": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated human-like computer control capability. Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, the development of such agents faces a critical bottleneck: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Further, these approaches exhibit significant gaps between the generated data and online environments, alongside limited data diversity. To address this issue, we introduce OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that overcomes the challenges above. Unlike prior methods that rely on preset tasks, OS-Genesis reverse engineers the GUI trajectory construction process. Agents first perceive environments and perform step-level interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's cost-effectiveness and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods",

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by leveraging a lightweight speculative draft model. However, existing designs suffers in performance due to misalignment between training and inference. Recent methods have tried to solve this issue by adopting a multi-step training strategy, but the complex inputs of different training steps make it harder for the draft model to converge. To address this, we propose CORAL, a novel framework that improves both accuracy and efficiency in speculative drafting. CORAL introduces Cross-Step Representation Alignment, a method that enhances consistency across multiple training steps, significantly improving speculative drafting performance. Additionally, we identify the LM head as a major bottleneck in the inference speed of the draft model. We introduce a weight-grouping mechanism that selectively activates a subset of LM head parameters during inference, substantially reducing the latency of the draft model. We evaluate CORAL on three LLM families and three benchmark datasets, achieving speedup ratios of 2.50x-4.07x, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as EAGLE-2 and HASS. Our results demonstrate that CORAL effectively mitigates training-inference misalignment and delivers significant speedup for modern LLMs with large vocabularies",

Evaluating such explanations is very difficult, as it includes not only the quality of the induced space of possible concepts but also how effectively the chosen concepts are communicated to users. Existing evaluation metrics often focus solely on the former, neglecting the latter.We introduce an evaluation framework for measuring concept explanations via automated simulatability: a simulator's ability to predict the explained model's outputs based on the provided explanations. This approach accounts for both the concept space and its interpretation in an end-to-end evaluation. Human studies for simulatability are notoriously difficult to enact, particularly at the scale of a wide, comprehensive empirical evaluation (which is the subject of this work). We propose using large language models (LLMs) as simulators to approximate the evaluation and report various analyses to make such approximations reliable. Our method allows for scalable and consistent evaluation across various models and datasets.

Using large-scale eye tracking data, we address this task with a wide range of models that cover different architectural and data representation strategies, and further introduce a new model ensemble. We find that transformer-based models with scanpath representations coupled with language modeling solve it most successfully, and that accurate predictions can be made in real time, shortly after the participant started reading the text.

It is little surprise that computational methods that estimate them do so using parallel visual and semantic spaces, such as collections of image-caption pairs or multi-modal models. In this paper, we work on the supposition that text itself in an image-caption dataset offers sufficient signals to accurately estimate these properties. We hypothesize, in particular, that the peakedness of the neighborhood of a word in the semantic embedding space reflects its degree of imageability and concreteness. We then propose an unsupervised, distribution-free measure, which we call Neighborhood Stability Measure (NSM), that quantifies the sharpness of peaks. Extensive experiments show that NSM correlates more strongly with ground-truth ratings than existing unsupervised methods, and is a strong predictor of these properties for classification.

To recover model performance after pruning, post-training is commonly employed to mitigate the resulting performance degradation. While post-training benefits from larger datasets, once the dataset size is already substantial, increasing the training data provides only limited performance gains. To balance post-training cost and model performance, it is necessary to explore the optimal amount of post-training data. Through extensive experiments on the Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5 series models, pruned using various common pruning methods, we uncover the scaling Law for Post-training after model Pruning, referred to as the P2 Law. This law identifies four key factors for predicting the pruned model's post-training loss: the model size before pruning, the number of post-training tokens, the pruning rate, and the model's loss before pruning. Moreover, P2 Law can generalize to larger dataset sizes, larger model sizes, and higher pruning rates, offering valuable insights for the post-training of pruned LLMs",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), the reward model (RM) evaluates the response quality based on the given context and assigns a reward. It plays a crucial role in aligning RLHF with human preferences. Although the current RM training paradigm concatenates the context and response while amplifying the reward difference between good and bad response pairs, we demonstrate that the RM faces two significant issues: i) it often allocates only a small proportion of attention to the context, and ii) it frequently ignores segments of the context that are relevant for evaluating the response quality. These issues undermine the RM's effectiveness in modeling human preferences.

Experimental results demonstrate that AttnRM significantly improves preference modeling by increasing attention to relevant information within the context.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "First-order logic (FOL) is often used to represent logical entailment, but determining natural language (NL) entailment using FOL remains a challenge. To address this, we propose the Entailment-Preserving FOL representations (EPF) task and introduce reference-free evaluation metrics for EPF (Entailment-Preserving Rate (EPR) family). In EPF, one should generate FOL representations from multi-premise NL entailment data (e.g., EntailmentBank) so that the automatic prover's result preserves the entailment labels. Furthermore, we propose a training method specialized for the task, iterative learning-to-rank, which trains an NL-to-FOL translator by using the natural language entailment labels as verifiable rewards. Our method achieves a 1.8–2.7% improvement in EPR and a 17.4–20.6% increase in EPR@16 compared to diverse baselines in three datasets. Further analyses reveal that iterative learning-to-rank effectively suppresses the arbitrariness of FOL representation by reducing the diversity of predicate signatures, and maintains strong performance across diverse inference types and out-of-domain data",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Automated interpretability pipelines generate natural language descriptions for the concepts represented by features in large language models (LLMs), such as \"plants\" or \"the first word in a sentence\". These descriptions are derived using inputs that activate the feature, which may be a dimension or a direction in the model's representation space. However, identifying activating inputs is costly, and the mechanistic role of a feature in model behavior is determined both by how inputs cause a feature to activate and by how feature activation affects outputs. Using steering evaluations, we reveal that current pipelines provide descriptions that fail to capture the causal effect of the feature on outputs. To fix this, we propose efficient, output-centric methods for automatically generating feature descriptions. These methods use the tokens weighted higher after feature stimulation or the highest weight tokens after applying the vocabulary \"unembedding\" head directly to the feature. Our output-centric descriptions better capture the causal effect of a feature on model outputs than input-centric descriptions, but combining the two leads to the best performance on both input and output evaluations. Lastly, we show that output-centric descriptions can be used to find inputs that activate features previously thought to be \"dead\"",

In this paper, we comprehensively study its key designs to balance the new abilities while retaining the original abilities, and present an effective CPT method that can greatly improve the Chinese language ability and scientific reasoning ability of LLMs. To achieve it, we design specific data mixture and curriculum strategies based on existing datasets and synthetic high-quality data. Concretely, we synthesize multidisciplinary scientific QA pairs based on related web pages to guarantee the data quality, and also devise the performance tracking and data mixture adjustment strategy to ensure the training stability.

The previous methods achieve high attack performance while being too cumbersome and time-consuming.

To this end, we propose a method called POUGH that incorporates an efficient optimization algorithm and two semantics-guided prompt organization strategies. Specifically, our method starts with a sampling strategy to select representative prompts from a candidate pool, followed by a ranking strategy that prioritizes them.

In this work, to address these challenges, we propose a High-resolution DocCompressor module to compress each high-resolution document image into 324 tokens, guided by low-resolution global visual features. With this compression module, to strengthen multi-page document comprehension ability and balance both token efficiency and question-answering performance, we develop the DocOwl2 under a three-stage training framework: Single-image Pretraining, Multi-image Continue-pretraining, and Multi-task Finetuning. DocOwl2 sets a new state-of-the-art across multi-page document understanding benchmarks and reduces first token latency by more than 50%.

However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what exactly quantifies natural language prompts.

We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating prompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We then examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their imbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps. Further, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural language prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. Finally, we explore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that single-property enhancements often have the greatest impact.

    "abstract": "The Turing test examines whether AIs exhibit human-like behaviour in natural language conversations. The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation. This fails to reflect a natural conversational style and hinders the evaluation of dialogue agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex and prolonged interactions. This paper proposes X-Turing, which enhances the original test with a burst dialogue pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the pseudo-dialogue history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the X-Turn Pass-Rate metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9% and 38.9% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term",

While natural language processing (NLP) offers promising tools for studying this phenomenon, current research lacks cohesion, employing discordant datasets and tasks that examine isolated aspects of moral reasoning. We bridge this gap with UniMoral, a unified dataset integrating psychologically grounded and social-media-derived moral dilemmas annotated with labels for action choices, ethical principles, contributing factors, and consequences, alongside annotators' moral and cultural profiles. Recognizing the cultural relativity of moral reasoning, UniMoral spans six languages, Arabic, Chinese, English, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish, capturing diverse socio-cultural contexts. We demonstrate UniMoral's utility through a benchmark evaluations of three large language models (LLMs) across four tasks: action prediction, moral typology classification, factor attribution analysis, and consequence generation. Key findings reveal that while implicitly embedded moral contexts enhance the moral reasoning capability of LLMs, there remains a critical need for increasingly specialized approaches to further advance moral reasoning in these models",

While some prior works have explored this issue in the context of LLMs, it presents a unique challenge for MLLMs due to the entangled nature of knowledge across modalities, making comprehensive unlearning more difficult. To address this challenge, we propose Modality Aware Neuron Unlearning (MANU), a novel unlearning framework for MLLMs designed to selectively clip neurons based on their relative importance to the targeted forget data, curated for different modalities. Specifically, MANU consists of two stages: important neuron selection and selective pruning. The first stage identifies and collects the most influential neurons across modalities relative to the targeted forget knowledge, while the second stage is dedicated to pruning those selected neurons. MANU effectively isolates and removes the neurons that contribute most to the forget data within each modality, while preserving the integrity of retained knowledge. Our experiments conducted across various MLLM architectures illustrate that MANU can achieve a more balanced and comprehensive unlearning in each modality without largely affecting the overall model utility",

Nutrition Question Answering (QA) has emerged as a popular method for addressing this problem. However, current research faces two critical limitations. On one hand, the absence of datasets involving user-specific medical information severely limits personalization. This challenge is further compounded by the wide variability in individual health needs. On the other hand, while large language models (LLMs), a popular solution for this task, demonstrate strong reasoning abilities, they struggle with the domain-specific complexities of personalized healthy dietary reasoning, and existing benchmarks fail to capture these challenges. To address these gaps, we introduce the Nutritional Graph Question Answering (NGQA) benchmark, the first graph question answering dataset designed for personalized nutritional health reasoning. NGQA leverages data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) to evaluate whether a food is healthy for a specific user, supported by explanations of the key contributing nutrients. The benchmark incorporates three question complexity settings and evaluates reasoning across three downstream tasks. Extensive experiments with LLM backbones and baseline models demonstrate that the NGQA benchmark effectively challenges existing models.

We establish a finite-sample generalization bound showing that effective knowledge transfer depends on robust performance in both domains, minimizing latent-space discrepancy, and preventing overfitting to the data. Guided by these insights, we propose DALTA (Domain-Aligned Latent Topic Adaptation), a new framework that employs a shared encoder for domain-invariant features, specialized decoders for domain-specific nuances, and adversarial alignment to selectively transfer relevant information.

First, we prepare the dataset on knowledge question-answering (QA) samples by calculating two uncertainty estimations, including confidence score and semantic entropy, to represent the knowledge boundaries for LLMs. Subsequently, using the prepared dataset, we train a reward model that incorporates uncertainty estimations and then employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for factuality alignment on LLMs. Experimental results indicate that, by integrating uncertainty representations in LLM alignment, the proposed UAlign can significantly enhance the LLMs' capacities to confidently answer known questions and refuse unknown questions on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks, showing reliability improvements and good generalizability over various prompt- and training-based baselines",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought significantly enhances a model's reasoning capability, but it also comes with a considerable increase in inference costs due to long chains. With the observation that the reasoning path can be easily compressed under easy tasks but struggle on hard tasks, we explore the feasibility of elastically controlling the length of reasoning paths with only one model, thereby reducing the inference overhead of reasoning models dynamically based on task difficulty. We introduce a new tuning and inference strategy named CoT-Valve, designed to allow models to generate reasoning chains of varying lengths. To achieve this, we propose to identify a direction in the parameter space that, when manipulated, can effectively control the length of generated CoT. Moreover, we show that this property is valuable for compressing the reasoning chain. We construct datasets with chains from long to short for the same questions and explore two enhanced strategies for CoT-Valve: (1) a precise length-compressible CoT tuning method, and (2) a progressive chain length compression approach. Our experiments show that CoT-Valve successfully enables controllability and compressibility of the chain and shows better performance than the prompt-based control. We applied this method to QwQ-32B-Preview, reducing reasoning chains on GSM8K from 741 to 225 tokens with a minor performance drop (95.07% to 94.92%) and on AIME from 6827 to 4629 tokens, with only one additional incorrect answer",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts.Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) integrated into multi-step agent systems enable complex decision-making processes across various applications. However, their outputs often lack reliability, making uncertainty estimation crucial. Existing uncertainty estimation methods primarily focus on final-step outputs, which fail to account for cumulative uncertainty over the multi-step decision-making process and the dynamic interactions between agents and their environments. To address these limitations, we propose SAUP (Situation Awareness Uncertainty Propagation), a novel framework that propagates uncertainty through each step of an LLM-based agent's reasoning process. SAUP incorporates situational awareness by assigning situational weights to each step's uncertainty during the propagation. Our method, compatible with various one-step uncertainty estimation techniques, provides a comprehensive and accurate uncertainty measure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAUP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 20% improvement in AUROC",

We demonstrate that this scale-invariant behavior is unique to RoPE, emerges through distinct evolutionary phases during training, and statistically adheres to the fundamental uncertainty principle.

    "abstract": "Factual hallucinations are a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). They undermine reliability and user trust by generating inaccurate or fabricated content. Recent studies suggest that when generating false statements, the internal states of LLMs encode information about truthfulness. However, these studies often rely on synthetic datasets that lack realism, which limits generalization when evaluating the factual accuracy of text generated by the model itself. In this paper, we challenge the findings of previous work by investigating truthfulness encoding capabilities, leading to the generation of a more realistic and challenging dataset. Specifically, we extend previous work by introducing: (1) a strategy for sampling plausible true-false factoid sentences from tabular data and (2) a procedure for generating realistic, LLM-dependent true-false datasets from Question Answering collections. Our analysis of two open-source LLMs reveals that while the findings from previous studies are partially validated, generalization to LLM-generated datasets remains challenging. This study lays the groundwork for future research on factuality in LLMs and offers practical guidelines for more effective evaluation",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption across various domains, leveraging vast pre-training knowledge and impressive generalization capabilities. However, these models often inherit biased knowledge, resulting in unfair decisions in sensitive applications. It is challenging to remove this biased knowledge without compromising reasoning abilities due to the entangled nature of the learned knowledge within LLMs. To solve this problem, existing approaches have attempted to mitigate the bias using techniques such as fine-tuning with unbiased datasets, model merging, and gradient ascent. While these methods have experimentally proven effective, they can still be sub-optimum in fully disentangling biases from reasoning. To address this gap, we propose Selective Disentanglement Unlearning (SDU), a novel unlearning framework that selectively removes biased knowledge while preserving reasoning capabilities. SDU operates in three stages: identifying biased parameters using a shadow LLM, fine-tuning with unbiased data, and performing selective parameter updates based on weight saliency. Experimental results across multiple LLMs show that SDU improves fairness accuracy by 14.7% and enhances reasoning performance by 62.6% compared to existing baselines",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become central to NLP, demonstrating their ability to adapt to various tasks through prompting techniques, including sentiment analysis. However, we still have a limited understanding of how these models capture sentiment-related information. This study probes the hidden layers of LLaMA models to pinpoint where sentiment features are most represented and to assess how this affects sentiment analysis.Using probe classifiers, we analyze sentiment encoding across layers and scales, identifying the layers and pooling methods that best capture sentiment signals. Our results show that sentiment information is most concentrated in mid-layers for binary polarity tasks, with detection accuracy increasing up to 14% over prompting techniques. Additionally, we find that in decoder-only models, the last token is not consistently the most informative for sentiment encoding. Finally, this approach enables sentiment tasks to be performed with memory requirements reduced by an average of 57%.These insights contribute to a broader understanding of sentiment in LLMs, suggesting layer-specific probing as an effective approach for sentiment tasks beyond prompting, with potential to enhance model utility and reduce memory requirements",

This representation allows us to capture the hierarchical and spatial structure of code, especially the dependencies between code lines. Our method CoDE introduces a dependency encoding approach that leverages dictionary learning to perform semantic matching between code lines. As such, it avoids the reliance on strict position indices, leading to better generalization to code with diverse context and lengths. We thoroughly evaluate CoDE based on four categories of tasks.

Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques",

While retrieval augmented generation (RAG) shows great promise in large language model (LLM) based automated question answering, previous works often isolate neural and symbolic retrieval despite their complementary strengths.

In this work, we propose NeuSym-RAG, a hybrid neural symbolic retrieval framework which combines both paradigms in an interactive process. By leveraging multi-view chunking and schema-based parsing, NeuSym-RAG organizes semi-structured PDF content into both the relational database and vectorstore, enabling LLM agents to iteratively gather context until sufficient to generate answers. Experiments on three full PDF-based QA datasets, including a self-annotated one AirQA-Real, show that NeuSym-RAG stably defeats both the vector-based RAG and various structured baselines, highlighting its capacity to unify both retrieval schemes and utilize multiple views",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces F5-TTS, a fully non-autoregressive text-to-speech system based on flow matching with Diffusion Transformer (DiT). Without requiring complex designs such as duration model, text encoder, and phoneme alignment, the text input is simply padded with filler tokens to the same length as input speech, and then the denoising is performed for speech generation, which was originally proved feasible by E2 TTS. However, the original design of E2 TTS makes it hard to follow due to its slow convergence and low robustness. To address these issues, we first model the input with ConvNeXt to refine the text representation, making it easy to align with the speech. We further propose an inference-time Sway Sampling strategy, which significantly improves our model's performance and efficiency. This sampling strategy for flow step can be easily applied to existing flow matching based models without retraining. Our design allows faster training and achieves an inference RTF of 0.15, which is greatly improved compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based TTS models. Trained on a public 100K hours multilingual dataset, our F5-TTS exhibits highly natural and expressive zero-shot ability, seamless code-switching capability, and speed control efficiency.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Open Relation Extraction (OpenRE) seeks to identify and extract novel relational facts between named entities from unlabeled data without pre-defined relation schemas. Traditional OpenRE methods typically assume that the unlabeled data consists solely of novel relations or is pre-divided into known and novel instances. However, in real-world scenarios, novel relations are arbitrarily distributed. In this paper, we propose a generalized OpenRE setting that considers unlabeled data as a mixture of both known and novel instances. To address this, we propose MixORE, a two-phase framework that integrates relation classification and clustering to jointly learn known and novel relations. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MixORE consistently outperforms competitive baselines in known relation classification and novel relation clustering. Our findings contribute to the advancement of generalized OpenRE research and real-world applications",

Recent adaptive retrieval methods integrate LLMs' intrinsic knowledge with external information appealing to LLM self-knowledge, but they often neglect efficiency evaluations and comparisons with uncertainty estimation techniques. We bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive analysis of 35 adaptive retrieval methods, including 8 recent approaches and 27 uncertainty estimation techniques, across 6 datasets using 10 metrics for QA performance, self-knowledge, and efficiency.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Given the increasing use of synthetic data in language model (LM) post-training, an LM's ability to generate high-quality data has become nearly as crucial as its ability to solve problems directly. While prior works have focused on developing effective data generation methods, they lack systematic comparison of different LMs as data generators in a unified setting. To address this gap, we propose AgoraBench, a benchmark that provides standardized settings and metrics to evaluate LMs' data generation abilities. Through synthesizing 1.26 million training instances using 6 LMs and training 99 student models, we uncover key insights about LMs' data generation capabilities. First, we observe that LMs exhibit distinct strengths. For instance, GPT-4o excels at generating new problems, while Claude-3.5-Sonnet performs better at enhancing existing ones. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that an LM's data generation ability doesn't necessarily correlate with its problem-solving ability. Instead, multiple intrinsic features of data quality—including response quality, perplexity, and instruction difficulty—collectively serve as better indicators. Finally, we demonstrate that strategic choices in output format and cost-conscious model selection significantly impact data generation effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in reasoning tasks, including mathematical reasoning and logical deduction. Among these reasoning tasks, graph problems stand out due to their complexity and unique structural characteristics, attracting considerable attention from researchers. Previous studies have explored LLMs' graph reasoning abilities through various techniques, such as different encoding methods for graph structures and the use of carefully designed prompts. However, a critical factor has been mostly overlooked: the prompt sequential order in which graph descriptions are presented to the models. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of how the order of graph descriptions impacts LLM performance. Specifically, we comprehensively evaluate four graph description orders across six graph problems using six mainstream LLMs. The results reveal that: (1) ordered graph descriptions significantly improve LLMs' comprehension of graph structures; (2) the robustness of LLMs to graph description order varies across different tasks; and (3) the impact of graph order on performance is closely related to the inherent characteristics of tasks. This study provides a critical advancement in the application of LLMs for solving graph-related problems, paving the way for future research to optimize model performance through strategic graph description ordering",

We introduce Learning2Rewrite, a novel framework to detect LLM-generated text with exceptional generalization to unseen domains.

Extensive experiments on data from 21 independent domains and four major LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama-3) demonstrate that our detector outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods by up to 23.04% in AUROC for in-distribution tests, 35.10% for out-of-distribution tests, and 48.66% under adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).However, existing benchmarks and evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (i.e., key points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption.

To identify these columns, we developed a generalized sensitivity metric that extends and unifies metrics from previous studies.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made exciting achievements across various domains, yet their deployment on resource-constrained personal devices remains hindered by the prohibitive computational and memory demands of task-specific fine-tuning. While quantization offers a pathway to efficiency, existing methods struggle to balance performance and overhead, either incurring high computational/memory costs or failing to address activation outliers—a critical bottleneck in quantized fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose the Outlier Spatial Stability Hypothesis (__OSSH__): _During fine-tuning, certain activation outlier channels retain stable spatial positions across training iterations._ Building on OSSH, we propose __Quaff__, a Quantized parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for LLMs, optimizing low-precision activation representations through targeted momentum scaling. Quaff dynamically suppresses outliers exclusively in invariant channels using lightweight operations, eliminating full-precision weight storage and global rescaling while reducing quantization errors. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks validate OSSH and demonstrate Quaff's efficacy. Specifically, on the GPQA reasoning benchmark, Quaff achieves a 1.73× latency reduction and 30% memory savings over full-precision fine-tuning while improving accuracy by 0.6% on the Phi-3 model, reconciling the triple trade-off between efficiency, performance, and deployability. By enabling consumer-grade GPU fine-tuning (e.g., RTX 2080 Super) without sacrificing model utility, Quaff democratizes personalized LLM deployment.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel task to evaluate the robust understanding capability of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), termed Unsolvable Problem Detection (UPD). Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is widely used to assess the understanding capability of LMMs, but it does not guarantee that LMMs truly comprehend the answer. UPD assesses the LMM's ability to withhold answers when encountering unsolvable problems of MCQA, verifying whether the model truly understands the answer. UPD encompasses three problems: Absent Answer Detection (AAD), Incompatible Answer Set Detection (IASD), and Incompatible Visual Question Detection (IVQD), covering unsolvable cases like answer-lacking or incompatible choices and image-question mismatches. For the evaluation, we introduce the MM-UPD Bench, a benchmark for assessing performance across various ability dimensions. Our experiments reveal that even most LMMs, which demonstrate adequate performance on existing benchmarks, struggle significantly with MM-UPD, underscoring a novel aspect of trustworthiness that current benchmarks have overlooked. A detailed analysis shows that LMMs have different bottlenecks and chain-of-thought and self-reflection improved performance for LMMs with the bottleneck in their LLM capability. We hope our insights will enhance the broader understanding and development of more reliable LMMs",

While bias in models are well-documented, less is known about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two interactive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in LLMs on political opinions and decision-making. Participants interacted freely with either a biased liberal, biased conservative, or unbiased control model while completing these tasks. We found that participants exposed to partisan biased models were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions which matched the LLM's bias. Even more surprising, this influence was seen when the model bias and personal political partisanship of the participant were opposite. However, we also discovered that prior knowledge of AI was weakly correlated with a reduction of the impact of the bias, highlighting the possible importance of AI education for robust mitigation of bias effects. Our findings not only highlight the critical effects of interacting with biased LLMs and its ability to impact public discourse and political conduct, but also highlights potential techniques for mitigating these risks in the future",

This self-expansion strategy allows LexTempus to adapt to new information without forgetting past knowledge, thereby improving temporal generalization.

To address this, (1) we propose ArchiMetricsNet, the first floor plan dataset that includes functionality, flow, and overall evaluation scores, along with detailed textual analyses. We trained FloorPlan-MPS (Multi-dimensional Preference Score) on it. (2) We develope FloorPlan-LLaMa, a floor plan generation model based on autoregressive framework.

This fails to assess the model's ability to reflect and rectify mistakes within the reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce FINEREASON, a logic-puzzle benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs' reasoning capabilities.

Building on this, we introduce two tasks: state checking and state transition, for a comprehensive evaluation of how models assess the current situation and plan the next move. To support broader research, we also provide a puzzle training set aimed at enhancing general reasoning. We show that models trained on our state checking and transition data demonstrate gains in mathematical reasoning by up to 5.1%",

    "abstract": "Evaluating text revision in scientific writing remains a challenge, as traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore primarily focus on similarity rather than capturing meaningful improvements. In this work, we analyse and identify the limitations of these metrics and explore alternative evaluation methods that better align with human judgments. We first conduct a manual annotation study to assess the quality of different revisions. Then, we investigate reference-free evaluation metrics from related NLP domains. Additionally, we examine LLM-as-a-judge approaches, analysing their ability to assess revisions with and without a gold reference. Our results show that LLMs effectively assess instruction-following but struggle with correctness, while domain-specific metrics provide complementary insights. We find that a hybrid approach combining LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and task-specific metrics offers the most reliable assessment of revision",

Yet, efforts in this space often require sorting people into fixed buckets of pre-specified diversity-defining dimensions (e.g., demographics), risking smoothing out individualistic variations or even stereotyping. To achieve an authentic representation of diversity that respects individuality, we propose individualistic alignment. While individualistic alignment can take various forms, in this paper, we introduce IndieValueCatalog, a dataset transformed from the influential World Values Survey (WVS), to study language models (LMs) on the specific challenge of individualistic value reasoning. Given a sample of an individual's value-expressing statements, models are tasked with predicting their value judgments in novel cases. With IndieValueCatalog, we reveal critical limitations in frontier LMs' abilities to predict individualistic values with accuracies only ranging between 55% to 65%. Moreover, our results highlight that a precise description of individualistic values cannot be approximated only via demographic information. Finally, we train a series of IndieValueReasoners to reveal new patterns and dynamics into global human values",

For Slavic languages, the development of such algorithms is complicated by the rich derivational capabilities of these languages. Previous research has shown that, on average, these algorithms have already reached expert-level quality. However, a key unresolved issue is the significant decline in performance when segmenting words containing roots not present in the training data. This problem can be partially addressed by using pre-trained language models to better account for word semantics. In this work, we explored the possibility of fine-tuning BERT-like models for morpheme segmentation using data from Belarusian, Czech, and Russian. We found that for Czech and Russian, our models outperform all previously proposed approaches, achieving word-level accuracy of 92.5-95.1%. For Belarusian, this task was addressed for the first time. The best-performing approach for Belarusian was an ensemble of convolutional neural networks with word-level accuracy of 90.45%",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth in the parameters of LLMs has made inference latency a fundamental bottleneck. Speculative decoding represents a lossless approach to accelerate inference through a guess-and-verify paradigm. Some methods rely on additional architectures to guess draft tokens, which need extra training before use. Alternatively, retrieval-based train-free techniques build libraries from pre-existing corpora or by n-gram generation. However, they face challenges like large storage requirements, time-consuming retrieval, and limited adaptability. Observing that candidate tokens generated during the decoding process are likely to reoccur in future sequences, we propose Token Recycling. This approach stores candidate tokens in an adjacency matrix and employs a breadth-first-search (BFS)-like algorithm to construct a draft tree, which is then validated through tree attention. New candidate tokens from the decoding process are then used to update the matrix. Token Recycling requires <2MB of additional storage and achieves approximately 2x speedup across all sizes of LLMs. It significantly outperforms existing train-free methods by 30% and even a training method by 25%",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in long chain-of-thoughts (long CoTs) have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Existing work finds that the capability of long CoT reasoning can be efficiently elicited by tuning on only a few examples and can easily transfer to other tasks. This motivates us to investigate whether long CoT reasoning is a general capability for LLMs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis for this question from the perspective of representation. We find that LLMs do encode long CoT reasoning as a general capability, with a clear distinction from vanilla CoTs. Furthermore, domain-specific representations are also required for the effective transfer of long CoT reasoning. Inspired by these findings, we propose GLORE, a novel representation engineering method to unleash the general long CoT reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GLORE in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex reasoning tasks, achieving both accurate task performance and faithful explanations becomes crucial. However, LLMs often generate unfaithful explanations, partly because they do not consistently adhere closely to the provided context. Existing approaches to this problem either rely on superficial calibration methods, such as decomposed Chain-of-Thought prompting, or require costly retraining to improve model faithfulness. In this work, we propose a probabilistic inference paradigm that leverages task-specific and lookahead rewards to ensure that LLM-generated rationales are more faithful to model decisions and align better with input context. These rewards are derived from a domain-specific proposal distribution, allowing for optimized sequential Monte Carlo approximations. Our evaluations across three different reasoning tasks show that this method, which allows for controllable generation during inference, improves both accuracy and faithfulness of LLMs. This method offers a promising path towards making LLMs more reliable for reasoning tasks without sacrificing performance",

    "abstract": "Algorithmic fairness has conventionally adopted the mathematically convenient perspective of racial color-blindness (i.e., difference unaware treatment). However, we contend that in a range of important settings, group difference awareness matters. For example, differentiating between groups may be necessary in legal contexts (e.g., the U.S. compulsory draft applies to men but not women) and harm assessments (e.g., referring to girls as \"terrorists\" may be less harmful than referring to Muslim people as such). Thus, in contrast to most fairness work, we study fairness through the perspective of treating people differently — when it is contextually appropriate to. We first introduce an important distinction between descriptive (fact-based), normative (value-based), and correlation (association-based) benchmarks. This distinction is significant because each category requires separate interpretation and mitigation tailored to its specific characteristics. Then, we present a benchmark suite composed of eight different scenarios for a total of 16k questions that enables us to assess difference awareness. Finally, we show results across ten models that demonstrate difference awareness is a distinct dimension to fairness where existing bias mitigation strategies may backfire",

Model merging, which integrates multiple expert models into a single multi-task model, introduces a novel risk of unauthorized use of LLMs due to its efficient merging process. While fingerprinting techniques have been proposed for verifying model ownership, their resistance to model merging remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel fingerprinting method, MergePrint, which embeds robust fingerprints capable of surviving model merging. MergePrint enables black-box ownership verification, where owners only need to check if a model produces target outputs for specific fingerprint inputs, without accessing model weights or intermediate outputs. By optimizing against a pseudo-merged model that simulates merged behavior, MergePrint ensures fingerprints that remain detectable after merging. Additionally, to minimize performance degradation, we pre-optimize the fingerprint inputs. MergePrint pioneers a practical solution for black-box ownership verification, protecting LLMs from misappropriation via merging, while also excelling in resistance to broader model theft threats",

    "abstract": "Current large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce accurate responses on the first attempt for complex reasoning tasks like code generation. Prior research tackles this challenge by generating multiple candidate solutions and validating them with LLM-generated unit tests. The execution results of unit tests serve as reward signals to identify correct solutions. As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems. Based on these insights, we propose CodeRM-8B, a lightweight yet effective unit test generator that enables efficient and high-quality unit test scaling. Additionally, we implement a dynamic scaling mechanism that adapts the number of unit tests based on problem difficulty, further improving efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves performance across various models on three benchmarks (e.g., with gains of 18.43 for Llama3-8B and 3.42 for GPT-4o-mini on HumanEval Plus).

Prior zero-shot TTS models only mimic the speaker's voice without further control and adjustment capabilities while prior controllable TTS models cannot perform speaker-specific voice generation. Therefore, ControlSpeech focuses on a more challenging task—a TTS system with controllable timbre, content, and style at the same time. ControlSpeech takes speech prompts, content prompts, and style prompts as inputs and utilizes bidirectional attention and mask-based parallel decoding to capture codec representations corresponding to timbre, content, and style in a discrete decoupling codec space. Moreover, we analyze the many-to-many issue in textual style control and propose the Style Mixture Semantic Density (SMSD) module, which is based on Gaussian mixture density networks, to resolve this problem. To facilitate empirical validations, we make available a new style controllable dataset called VccmDataset.

To address this limitation, we propose a simple, efficient, and plug-in approach, Position ID Compression (PIC), to unlock the long-form text generation potential of LLMs. The idea is straightforward: by compressing the position ids of the context, we provoke and guide LLMs to generate coherent and longer output. Specifically, we find that directly reducing the position ids by a fixed ratio significantly impacts the generation quality. To mitigate this, we propose two variants of PIC: NTK-aware PIC and Dynamic PIC. Without additional training, both methods enable LLMs to extend their generation length by approximately 1.5 times without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, by integrating supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with PIC, we propose PIC-SFT, which further improves LLMs' long-form text generation capabilities, achieving top performance on HelloBench and LongBench-Write.

We, therefore, introduce the concept of Intent Hallucination, a phenomenon where LLMs either omit (failing to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented query parts) elements of the given query, leading to responses misaligned with the original query. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068 problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for state-of-the-art models, and (2) such a phenomenon stems from omission or misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, named INTENT CONSTRAINT, for detecting intent hallucination.

In this paper, we propose Multidimensional Multi-Agent Debate (M-MAD), a systematic LLM-based multi-agent framework for advanced LLM-as-a-judge MT evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that M-MAD achieves significant advancements by (1) decoupling heuristic MQM criteria into distinct evaluation dimensions for fine-grained assessments; (2) employing multi-agent debates to harness the collaborative reasoning capabilities of LLMs; (3) synthesizing dimension-specific results into a final evaluation judgment to ensure robust and reliable outcomes. Comprehensive experiments show that M-MAD not only outperforms all existing LLM-as-a-judge methods but also competes with state-of-the-art reference-based automatic metrics, even when powered by a suboptimal model like GPT-4o mini.

    "title": "SongComposer: A Large Language Model for Lyric and Melody Generation in Song Composition",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Creating lyrics and melodies for the vocal track in a symbolic format, known as song composition, demands expert musical knowledge of melody, an advanced understanding of lyrics, and precise alignment between them. Despite achievements in sub-tasks such as lyric generation, lyric-to-melody, and melody-to-lyric, etc, a unified model for song composition has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we introduce SongComposer, a pioneering step towards a unified song composition model that can readily create symbolic lyrics and melodies following instructions. SongComposer is a music-specialized large language model (LLM) that, for the first time, integrates the capability of simultaneously composing lyrics and melodies into LLMs by leveraging three key innovations: 1) a flexible tuple format for word-level alignment of lyrics and melodies, 2) an extended tokenizer vocabulary for song notes, with scalar initialization based on musical knowledge to capture rhythm, and 3) a multi-stage pipeline that captures musical structure, starting with motif-level melody patterns and progressing to phrase-level structure for improved coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SongComposer outperforms advanced LLMs, including GPT-4, in tasks such as lyric-to-melody generation, melody-to-lyric generation, song continuation, and text-to-song creation. Moreover, we will release SongCompose, a large-scale dataset for training, containing paired lyrics and melodies in Chinese and English",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Personalized text generation aims to infer users' writing style preferences from their historical texts and generate outputs that faithfully reflect these stylistic characteristics. Existing solutions primarily adopt two paradigms: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). While these approaches have advanced the field, they suffer from two critical limitations: (1) the entanglement of content semantics and stylistic patterns in historical texts impedes accurate modeling of user-specific writing preferences; and (2) scalability challenges arising from both RAG's inference latency by retrieval operations and PEFT's parameter storage requirements for per user model. To overcome these limitations, we propose StyleVector, a training-free framework that disentangles and represents personalized writing style as a vector in LLM's activation space, enabling style-steered generation during inference without requiring costly retrieval or parameter storage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a significant 8% relative improvement in personalized generation while reducing storage requirements by 1700 × over PEFT method",

To overcome these limitations, we reframe the reranking process as an attention-mask problem and propose Gumbel Reranking, an end-to-end training framework for rerankers aimed at minimizing the training-inference gap. In our approach, reranker optimization is reformulated as learning a stochastic, document-wise Top-k attention mask using the Gumbel Trick and Relaxed Top-k Sampling. This formulation enables end-to-end optimization by minimizing the overall language loss.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Learning from human feedback has enabled the alignment of language models (LMs) with human preferences. However, collecting human preferences is expensive and time-consuming, with highly variable annotation quality. An appealing alternative is to distill preferences from LMs as a source of synthetic annotations, offering a cost-effective and scalable alternative, albeit susceptible to other biases and errors. In this work, we introduce HyPER, a Hybrid Preference routER that defers an annotation to either humans or LMs, achieving better annotation quality while reducing the cost of human-only annotation. We formulate this as an optimization problem: given a preference dataset and an evaluation metric, we (1) train a performance prediction model (PPM) to predict a reward model's (RM) performance on an arbitrary combination of human and LM annotations and (2) employ a routing strategy that selects a combination that maximizes predicted performance. We train the PPM on MultiPref, a new preference dataset with 10K instances paired with human and LM labels. We show that the selected hybrid mixture of synthetic and direct human preferences using HyPER achieves better RM performance compared to using either one exclusively by 7-13% on RewardBench and generalizes across unseen preference datasets and other base models. We also observe the same trend in other benchmarks using Best-of-N reranking, where the hybrid mix has 2-3% better performance. Finally, we analyze features from HyPER and find that prompts with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit the most from human feedback",

    "title": "SEOE: A Scalable and Reliable Semantic Evaluation Framework for Open Domain Event Detection",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Automatic evaluation for Open Domain Event Detection (ODED) is a highly challenging task, because ODED is characterized by a vast diversity of un-constrained output labels from various domains. Nearly all existing evaluation methods for ODED usually first construct evaluation benchmarks with limited labels and domain coverage, and then evaluate ODED methods using metrics based on token-level label matching rules. However, this kind of evaluation framework faces two issues: (1) The limited evaluation benchmarks lack representatives of the real world, making it difficult to accurately reflect the performance of various ODED methods in real-world scenarios; (2) Evaluation metrics based on token-level matching rules fail to capture semantic similarity between predictions and golden labels. To address these two problems above, we propose a scalable and reliable Semantic-level Evaluation framework for Open domain Event detection (SEOE) by constructing a more representative evaluation benchmark and introducing a semantic evaluation metric. Specifically, our proposed framework first constructs a scalable evaluation benchmark that currently includes 564 event types covering 7 major domains, with a cost-effective supplementary annotation strategy to ensure the benchmark's representativeness. The strategy also allows for the supplement of new event types and domains in the future. Then, the proposed SEOE leverages large language models (LLMs) as automatic evaluation agents to compute a semantic F1-score, incorporating fine-grained definitions of semantically similar labels to enhance the reliability of the evaluation. Extensive experiments validate the representatives of the benchmark and the reliability of the semantic evaluation metric. Existing ODED methods are thoroughly evaluated, and the error patterns of predictions are analyzed, revealing several insightful findings",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However, large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are prone to generating \"hallucinated\" content from Humans. In this work, we introduce DRAG, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach leverages evidence- and knowledge graph–based distillation, ensuring that the distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, DRAG effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving high-level efficiency and reliability. With DRAG, we provide a practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and generation capabilities in small-size LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/VILA-Lab/DRAG",

While LLM alignment studies cover many areas, one important yet underexplored area is how LLMs make judgments about obligations. This work reveals a strong tendency in LLMs to judge non-obligatory contexts as obligations when prompts are augmented with modal expressions such as must or ought to. We introduce this phenomenon as Deontological Keyword Bias (DKB). We find that LLMs judge over 90% of commonsense scenarios as obligations when modal expressions are present. This tendency is consist across various LLM families, question types, and answer formats. To mitigate DKB, we propose a judgment strategy that integrates few-shot examples with reasoning prompts. This study sheds light on how modal expressions, as a form of linguistic framing, influence the normative decisions of LLMs and underscores the importance of addressing such biases to ensure judgment alignment",

Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner, we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and process verification labels.

Furthermore, we investigate the influence of collocational frequency and sentence probability—proxies for human processing known to affect idiom resolution—on model performance. Our results show that LLMs frequently fail to resolve idiomaticity when it depends on contextual understanding, performing better on sentences deemed more likely by the model. Additionally, idiom frequency influences performance but does not guarantee accurate interpretation.

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose ChartCoder, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code.

In this work, we first propose a method to reliably classify animacy classes of nominals in 11 languages from 5 families, leveraging multilingual large language models (LLMs) and word sense disambiguation datasets. Then, through this newly acquired data, we verify that animacy displays consistent cross-linguistic tendencies in terms of preferred morphosyntactic constructions, although not always in line with received wisdom: animacy in nouns correlates with the alignment role of agent, early positions in a clause, and syntactic pivot (e.g., for relativisation), but not necessarily with grammatical subjecthood. Furthermore, the behaviour of personal pronouns in the hierarchy is idiosyncratic as they are rarely plural and relativised, contrary to high-animacy nouns",

This task becomes particularly important in specialized medical, engineering, and other technical domains, owing to the highly infrequent usage of the terms and scarcity of data involving domain-specific terms especially for low-resource languages. We propose a new model to generate dictionary words for 6 Indian languages in the multi-domain setting.

We first establish a reliable evaluation protocol to guide model development—instead of perplexity or simple needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) tests, we use a broad set of long-context downstream tasks, and we evaluate models after SFT as this better reveals long-context abilities. Supported by our robust evaluations, we run thorough experiments to decide the data mix for continued pre-training, the instruction tuning dataset, and many other design choices such as position extrapolation. We find that (1) code repositories and books are excellent sources of long data, but it is crucial to combine them with high-quality short-context data; (2) training with a sequence length beyond the evaluation length boosts long-context performance; (3) for SFT, using only short instruction datasets yields strong performance on long-context tasks. Our final model, ProLong-8B, which is initialized from Llama-3 and trained on 40B tokens, demonstrates state-of-the-art long-context performance among similarly sized models at a length of 128K. ProLong outperforms Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the majority of long-context tasks despite using only 5% as many tokens during long-context training.

Inspired by human learning processes, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure to interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that enhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis. MathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential fusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2) parallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual understanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware selective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these strategies, we generate a new dataset, MathFusionQA, followed by fine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental results demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in mathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting performance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while requiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a substantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches",

In this paper, we present the first state-of-the-art results for mining argumentation schemes in natural language dialogue. For this purpose, we create QT-Schemes, a new corpus of 441 arguments annotated with 24 argumentation schemes. Using this corpus, we leverage the capabilities of LLMs and Transformer-based models, pre-training them on a large corpus containing textbook-like argumentation schemes and validating their applicability in real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of multi-modal large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computers, mobile phones and web browsers by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components and capabilities. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation metrics and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse platforms and tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research.

We divide these quality issues into two categories: micro-level and macro-level. We find that macro-level issues are more prevalent in less institutionalized, often under-resourced languages. We provide a case analysis of Taiwanese Southern Min (nan_tw) that highlights the need for proactive language planning (e.g. orthography prescriptions, dialect boundary definition) and enhanced data quality control in the process of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) dataset creation.

To address this, we introduce VLM2-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess whether VLMs can Visually Link Matching cues, with 9 subtasks and over 3,000 test cases. Comprehensive evaluation across twelve VLMs, along with further analysis of various language-side and vision-side prompting methods, leads to a total of eight key findings. We identify critical challenges in models' ability to link visual cues, highlighting a significant performance gap. Based on these insights, we advocate for (i) enhancing core visual capabilities to improve adaptability and reduce reliance on prior knowledge, (ii) establishing clearer principles for integrating language-based reasoning in vision-centric tasks to prevent unnecessary biases, and (iii) shifting vision-text training paradigms toward fostering models' ability to independently structure and infer relationships among visual cues",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in visual generative models have enabled high-quality image and video generation, opening diverse applications. However, evaluating these models often demands sampling hundreds or thousands of images or videos, making the process computationally expensive, especially for diffusion-based models with inherently slow sampling. Moreover, existing evaluation methods rely on rigid pipelines that overlook specific user needs and provide numerical results without clear explanations. In contrast, humans can quickly form impressions of a model's capabilities by observing only a few samples. To mimic this, we propose the Evaluation Agent framework, which employs human-like strategies for efficient, dynamic, multi-round evaluations using only a few samples per round, while offering detailed, user-tailored analyses. It offers four key advantages: 1) efficiency, 2) promptable evaluation tailored to diverse user needs, 3) explainability beyond single numerical scores, and 4) scalability across various models and tools. Experiments show that Evaluation Agent reduces evaluation time to 10% of traditional methods while delivering comparable results.

    "abstract": "A common use of NLP is to facilitate the understanding of large document collections, with models based on Large Language Models (LLMs) replacing probabilistic topic models. Yet the effectiveness of LLM-based approaches in real-world applications remains under explored. This study measures the knowledge users acquire with topic models—including traditional, unsupervised and supervised LLM- based approaches—on two datasets. While LLM-based methods generate more human- readable topics and show higher average win probabilities than traditional models for data exploration, they produce overly generic topics for domain-specific datasets that do not easily allow users to learn much about the documents. Adding human supervision to LLM-based topic models improves data exploration by addressing hallucination and genericity but requires more human efforts. In contrast, traditional models like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) remain effective for exploration but are less user-friendly. This paper provides best practices—there is no one right model, the choice of models is situation-specific—and suggests potential improvements for scalable LLM- based topic models",

Despite significant efforts in evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), active perception has been largely overlooked. To address this gap, we propose a novel benchmark named ActiView to evaluate active perception in MLLMs. We focus on a specialized form of Visual Question Answering (VQA) that eases and quantifies the evaluation yet challenging for existing MLLMs. Meanwhile, intermediate reasoning behaviors of models are also discussed. Given an image, we restrict the perceptual field of a model, requiring it to actively zoom or shift its perceptual field based on reasoning to answer the question successfully. We conduct extensive evaluation over 30 models, including proprietary and open-source models, and observe that restricted perceptual fields play a significant role in enabling active perception. Results reveal a significant gap in the active perception capability of MLLMs, indicating that this area deserves more attention.

Using a controlled setting of biased coin flips, we find that: (1) LLMs often possess biased priors, causing initial divergence in zero-shot settings, (2) in-context evidence outweighs explicit bias instructions, (3) LLMs broadly follow Bayesian posterior updates, with deviations primarily due to miscalibrated priors rather than flawed updates, and (4) attention magnitude has negligible effect on Bayesian inference. With sufficient demonstrations of biased coin flips via ICL, LLMs update their priors in a Bayesian manner.

To track progress, robust benchmarks are required to evaluate their capabilities beyond superficial pattern recognition. However, current LLM reasoning benchmarks often face challenges such as insufficient interpretability, performance saturation or data contamination. To address these challenges, we introduce GAMEBoT, a gaming arena designed for rigorous and transparent assessment of LLM reasoning capabilities. GAMEBoT decompose complex reasoning in games into predefined modular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts infused with domain knowledge to guide LLMs in addressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a suite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems, enabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This approach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the accuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates the risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM competitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing various strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that GAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with detailed CoT prompts",

We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field",

However, their applicability to low-resource languages remains limited due to lack of both labeled data for fine-tuning, and unlabeled text for pre-training. In this paper, we propose TransFusion, a framework in which models are fine-tuned to use English translations of low-resource language data, enabling more precise predictions through annotation fusion. Based on TransFusion, we introduce GoLLIE-TF, a cross-lingual instruction-tuned LLM for IE tasks, designed to close the performance gap between high and low-resource languages. Our experiments across twelve multilingual IE datasets spanning 50 languages demonstrate that GoLLIE-TF achieves better cross-lingual transfer over the base model. In addition, we show that TransFusion significantly improves low-resource language named entity recognition when applied to proprietary models such as GPT-4 (+5 F1) with a prompting approach, or fine-tuning different language models including decoder-only (+14 F1) and encoder-only (+13 F1) architectures",

    "abstract": "Learning from preference feedback is essential for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and improving the quality of generated responses. However, existing preference learning methods rely heavily on curated data from humans or advanced LLMs, which is costly and difficult to scale. In this work, we present PUGC, a novel framework that leverages implicit human Preferences in unlabeled User-Generated Content (UGC) to generate preference data. Although UGC is not explicitly created to guide LLMs in generating human-preferred responses, it often reflects valuable insights and implicit preferences from its creators that has the potential to address readers' questions. PUGC transforms UGC into user queries and generates responses from the policy model. The UGC is then leveraged as a reference text for response scoring, aligning the model with these implicit preferences. This approach improves the quality of preference data while enabling scalable, domain-specific alignment. Experimental results on Alpaca Eval 2 show that models trained with DPO and PUGC achieve a 9.37% performance improvement over traditional methods, setting a 35.93% state-of-the-art length-controlled win rate using Mistral-7B-Instruct. Further studies highlight gains in reward quality, domain-specific alignment effectiveness, robustness against UGC quality, and theory of mind capabilities.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Complex video question-answering (VQA) requires in-depth understanding of video contents including object and action recognition as well as video classification and summarization, which exhibits great potential in emerging applications in education and entertainment, etc. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) may accomplish this task by grasping the intention of a question and decomposing it to a series of visual recognition sub-tasks to find out the answer with the help of an agent. To tackle this task, we first collect a new dedicated Complex VQA dataset named CVQA and then propose VQAGuider, an innovative framework planning a few atomic visual recognition tools by video-related API matching. VQAGuider facilitates a deep engagement with video content and precise responses to complex video-related questions by MLLMs, which is beyond aligning visual and language features for simple VQA tasks. Our experiments demonstrate VQAGuider is capable of navigating the complex VQA tasks by MLLMs and improves the accuracy by 29.6% and 17.2% on CVQA and the existing VQA datasets, respectively, highlighting its potential in advancing MLLMs's capabilities in video understanding",

    "title": "Large Language Models are Good Relational Learners",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, yet their application to relational deep learning (RDL) remains underexplored. Existing approaches adapt LLMs by traversing relational links between entities in a database and converting the structured data into flat text documents, but this text-based serialization disregards critical relational structures, introduces redundancy, and often exceeds standard LLM context lengths. We introduce Rel-LLM, a novel architecture that employs a graph neural network (GNN) based encoder to create structured relational prompts for LLMs within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. Unlike traditional text-based serialization approaches, our method preserves the inherent relational structure of databases while enabling LLMs to effectively process and reason over complex entity relationships. Specifically, the GNN encoder extracts a local subgraph around an entity to build feature representations that contain relevant entity relationships and temporal dependencies. These representations are transformed into structured prompts using a denormalization process, effectively allowing the LLM to reason over relational structures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Rel-LLM outperforms existing methods on key RDL tasks, offering a scalable and efficient approach to integrating LLMs with structured data sources.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) work well in tasks ranging from image captioning to visual question answering (VQA), yet they struggle with spatial reasoning, a key skill for understanding our physical world that humans excel at. We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation. We plan to share our code and dataset in due course",

However, many large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and apply metaphors in multi-agent language games, hindering their ability to engage in covert communication and semantic evasion, which are crucial for strategic communication. To address this challenge, we introduce CoMet, a framework that enables LLM-based agents to engage in metaphor processing. CoMet combines a hypothesis-based metaphor reasoner with a metaphor generator that improves through self-reflection and knowledge integration. This enhances the agents' ability to interpret and apply metaphors, improving the strategic and nuanced quality of their interactions. We evaluate CoMet on two multi-agent language games—Undercover and Adversarial Taboo—which emphasize \"covert communication\" and \"semantic evasion\".

In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware framework designed to enhance the accuracy of LLM responses by systematically incorporating model confidence at critical decision points. We propose an approach that encourages multi-step reasoning in LLMs and quantify the confidence of intermediate answers such as numerical results in mathematical reasoning and proper nouns in open-domain generation. Then, the overall confidence of each reasoning chain is evaluated based on confidence of these critical intermediate steps. Finally, we aggregate the answer of generated response paths in a way that reflects the reliability of each generated content (as opposed to self-consistency in which each generated chain contributes equally to majority voting). We conducted extensive experiments in five datasets, three mathematical datasets and two open-domain datasets, using four LLMs. The results consistently validate the effectiveness of our novel confidence-aggregation method, leading to an accuracy improvement of up to 7.4% and 5.8% over baseline approaches in math and open-domain generation tasks, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the risk of misusing them, raising the need for accurate detection of LLM-generated content. In response, a viable solution is to inject imperceptible identifiers into LLMs, known as watermarks. Our research extends the existing watermarking methods by proposing the novel Sampling One Then Accepting (STA-1) method. STA-1 is an unbiased watermark that preserves the original token distribution in expectation and has a lower risk of producing unsatisfactory outputs in low-entropy scenarios compared to existing unbiased watermarks. In watermark detection, STA-1 does not require prompts or a white-box LLM, provides statistical guarantees, demonstrates high efficiency in detection time, and remains robust against various watermarking attacks. Experimental results on low-entropy and high-entropy datasets demonstrate that STA-1 achieves the above properties simultaneously, making it a desirable solution for watermarking LLMs. Implementation codes for this study are available online",

    "abstract": "Recent findings reveal that much of the knowledge in a Transformer-based Large Language Model (LLM) is encoded in its feed-forward (FFN) layers, where each FNN layer can be interpreted as the summation of sub-updates, each corresponding to a weighted column vector from the FFN's value parameter matrix that often encodes human-interpretable concepts. In light of this, we hypothesize that model performance and behaviors can be further enhanced and controlled by modulating the contributions of these sub-updates based on their relevance to the input or target output style, and propose LLMBraces, a novel and efficient method that computes relevance scores associated with value vectors in FFN layers and leverages these scores to dynamically adjust the contribution of sub-updates. By optimizing sub-update contributions, LLMBraces refines the prediction process, leading to more accurate and reliable outputs, much like a ‘brace' providing support and stability. Moreover, LLMBraces can be extended to support conditional control over generation characteristics, such as sentiment, thereby offering fine-grained steering of LLM outputs. Extensive experiments on various LLMs—including Qwen2.5-1.5B, Llama2-7B, and Llama3-8B—demonstrate that LLMBraces outperforms baseline approaches in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings while requiring significantly fewer tunable parameters, up to 75% fewer compared to LoRA. Furthermore, LLMBraces excels in sentiment-controlled generation and toxicity reduction, highlighting its potential for flexible, controlled text generation across applications",

Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109 human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs. These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs, conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than 20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top performing models onCONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5 (35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%)",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Reasoning is an intricate process that transcends both language and vision; yet, despite its inherently modality-agnostic nature, develop-ing effective multilingual and multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a substantial challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). They struggle to activate complex reasoning behaviours, delivering step-wise explanation, questioning and reflection, particularly in multilingual settings where high-quality supervision across languages is lacking. Recent works have introduced eclectic strategies to enhance MLLMs' reasoning; however, they remain related to a single language.To make MLLMs' reasoning capabilities aligned among languages and improve modality performances, we propose R2-MultiOmnia, a modular approach that instructs the models to abstract key elements of the reasoning process and then refine reasoning trajectories via self-correction. Specifically, we instruct the models producing multimodal synthetic resources by bridging modalities and then self-improving their capabilities. To stabilise learning and the reasoning processes structure, we propose Curriculum Learning Reasoning Stabilisation with structured output rewards to gradually refine the models' capabilities to learn and deliver robust reasoning processes. Experiments show that R2-MultiOmnia improves multimodal reasoning, gets aligned performances among the languages approaching strong models",

    "abstract": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like abilities in many language tasks, sparking interest in comparing LLMs' and humans' language processing. In this paper, we try to answer two questions: 1. What makes garden-path sentences hard to understand for humans? 2. Do the same reasons make garden-path sentences hard for LLMs as well? Based on psycholinguistic research, we formulate hypotheses on why garden-path sentences are hard, and test these hypotheses on human participants and a large suite of LLMs using comprehension questions. Our findings reveal that both LLMs and humans struggle with specific syntactic complexities, with some models showing high correlation with human comprehension. To complement our findings, we test LLM comprehension of garden-path constructions with paraphrasing and text-to-image generation tasks, and find that the results mirror the sentence comprehension question results, further validating our findings on LLM understanding of these constructions",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their cross-lingual consistency remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel methodology for efficiently identifying inherent cross-lingual weaknesses in LLMs. Our approach leverages beam search and LLM-based simulation to generate bilingual question pairs that expose performance discrepancies between English and target languages. We construct a new dataset of over 6,000 bilingual pairs across 16 languages using this methodology, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing weaknesses even in state-of-the-art models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our method precisely and cost-effectively pinpoints cross-lingual weaknesses, consistently revealing over 50% accuracy drops in target languages across a wide range of models. Moreover, further experiments investigate the relationship between linguistic similarity and cross-lingual weaknesses, revealing that linguistically related languages share similar performance patterns and benefit from targeted post-training.

    "abstract": "Safety concerns of Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have gradually become an important problem in various applications. Surprisingly, previous works indicate a counterintuitive phenomenon that using textual unlearning to align MLLMs achieves comparable safety performances with MLLMs aligned with image-text pairs. To explain such a phenomenon, we discover a Visual Safety Information Leakage (VSIL) problem in existing multimodal safety benchmarks, i.e., the potentially risky content in the image has been revealed in the textual query. Thus, MLLMs can easily refuse these sensitive image-text pairs according to textual queries only, leading to unreliable cross-modality safety evaluation of MLLMs. We also conduct a further comparison experiment between textual alignment and multimodal alignment to highlight this drawback. To this end, we construct Visual Leakless Safety Bench (VLSBench) with 2.2k image-text pairs through an automated data pipeline. Experimental results indicate that VLSBench poses a significant challenge to both open-source and close-source MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA, Qwen2-VL and GPT-4o. Besides, we empirically compare textual and multimodal alignment methods on VLSBench and find that textual alignment is effective enough for multimodal safety scenarios with VSIL, while multimodal alignment is preferable for safety scenarios without VSIL",

Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications.

However, there are public concerns about the potential of this platform to promote and amplify harmful content. This study presents the first systematic analysis of conspiracy theories on TikTok. By leveraging the official TikTok Research API we collect a longitudinal dataset of 1.5M videos shared in the U.S. over three years. We estimate a lower bound on the prevalence of conspiratorial videos (up to 1000 new videos per month) and evaluate the effects of TikTok's Creativity Program for monetization, observing an overall increase in video duration regardless of content. Lastly, we evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art open-weight Large Language Models to identify conspiracy theories from audio transcriptions of videos. While these models achieve high precision in detecting harmful content (up to 96%), their overall performance remains comparable to fine-tuned traditional models such as RoBERTa.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) require effective episodic grounding—the ability to learn from and apply past experiences—to perform well at physical planning tasks. While current approaches struggle with scalability and integration of episodic memory, which is particularly limited for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters), larger LMs (70-405B) offer untapped potential through their hierarchical representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge. Therefore, to unlock larger LMs' potential for grounding, we present a scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that efficiently transfers episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. It uses Monte Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel distillation method that preserves LM capabilities while incorporating episodic memory. This enables larger LMs to leverage their inherent advantages for improved physical planning. Experiments show our solution outperforms top proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks. Layer-wise probing reveals systematic improvements in task alignment, particularly in later LM layers. It shows stable generalization to even unseen scenarios, even as planning steps increase, whereas baselines deteriorate sharply beyond a complexity threshold of four planning steps",

Although these documents remain confidential under normal use, adversaries can manipulate input queries to extract private content.

Despite such visual inputs becoming more integrated into agentic applications, what types of risks and attacks exist around them still remain unclear. In this work, we demonstrate that VLM agents can be easily attacked by a set of carefully designed adversarial pop-ups, which human users would typically recognize and ignore. This distraction leads agents to click these pop-ups instead of performing their tasks as usual. Integrating these pop-ups into existing agent testing environments like OSWorld and VisualWebArena leads to an attack success rate (the frequency of the agent clicking the pop-ups) of 86% on average and decreases the task success rate by 47%. Basic defense techniques, such as asking the agent to ignore pop-ups or including an advertisement notice, are ineffective against the attack.

The explicit augmentation utilizes LLMs to enhance textual information through five diverse generation strategies. For implicit augmentation, we design five novel perturbation techniques that operate in the feature space on structural fused embeddings. These perturbations are crafted to keep the semantic and relational properties of the embeddings and make them more diverse.

External memory mechanisms have been proposed to address this limitation, enabling LLMs to maintain conversational continuity. However, existing approaches struggle with two key challenges. First, rigid memory granularity fails to capture the natural semantic structure of conversations, leading to fragmented and incomplete representations. Second, fixed retrieval mechanisms cannot adapt to diverse dialogue contexts and user interaction patterns. In this work, we propose Reflective Memory Management (RMM), a novel mechanism for long-term dialogue agents, integrating forward- and backward-looking reflections: (1) Prospective Reflection, which dynamically summarizes interactions across granularities—utterances, turns, and sessions—into a personalized memory bank for effective future retrieval, and (2) Retrospective Reflection, which iteratively refines the retrieval in an online reinforcement learning (RL) manner based on LLMs' cited evidence. Experiments show that RMM demonstrates consistent improvement across various metrics and benchmarks. For example, RMM shows more than 10% accuracy improvement over the baseline without memory management on the LongMemEval dataset",

Previous approaches to learning from errors synthesize training data by solely extrapolating from isolated bad cases, thereby failing to generalize the extensive patterns inherent within these cases. This paper presents Self-Error-Instruct (SEI), a framework that addresses these model weaknesses and synthesizes more generalized targeted training data. Specifically, we explore a target model on two mathematical datasets, GSM8K and MATH, to pinpoint bad cases. Then, we generate error keyphrases for these cases based on the instructor model's (GPT-4o) analysis and identify error types by clustering these keyphrases. Next, we sample a few bad cases during each generation for each identified error type and input them into the instructor model, which synthesizes additional training data using a self-instruct approach. This new data is refined through a one-shot learning process to ensure that only the most effective examples are kept. Finally, we use these curated data to fine-tune the target model, iteratively repeating the process to enhance performance. We apply our framework to various models and observe improvements in their reasoning abilities across both in-domain and out-of-domain mathematics datasets.

    "abstract": "We introduce SciVer, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the ability of foundation models to verify claims within a multimodal scientific context.SciVer consists of 3,000 expert-annotated examples over 1,113 scientific papers, covering four subsets, each representing a common reasoning type in multimodal scientific claim verification. To enable fine-grained evaluation, each example includes expert-annotated supporting evidence.We assess the performance of 21 state-of-the-art multimodal foundation models, including o4-mini, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-Vision, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiment reveals a substantial performance gap between these models and human experts on SciVer.Through an in-depth analysis of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and human-conducted error evaluations, we identify critical limitations in current open-source models, offering key insights to advance models' comprehension and reasoning in multimodal scientific literature tasks",

    "abstract": "Recently, language models (LMs) have produced excellent results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effectiveness is highly dependent on available pre-training resources, which is particularly challenging for low-resource languages such as Sinhala. Furthermore, the scarcity of benchmarks to evaluate LMs is also a major concern for low-resource languages. In this paper, we address these two challenges for Sinhala by (i) collecting the largest monolingual corpus for Sinhala, (ii) training multiple LMs on this corpus and (iii) compiling the first Sinhala NLP benchmark (Sinhala-GLUE) and evaluating LMs on it. We show the Sinhala LMs trained in this paper outperform the popular multilingual LMs, such as XLM-R and existing Sinhala LMs in downstream NLP tasks. All the trained LMs are publicly available. We also make Sinhala-GLUE publicly available as a public leaderboard, and we hope that it will enable further advancements in developing and evaluating LMs for Sinhala",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in LLMs unlearning have shown remarkable success in removing unwanted data-model influences while preserving the model's utility for legitimate knowledge. Despite these strides, sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs–a key subset of the LLM family–have remained unexplored in the context of unlearning. As MoE LLMs are celebrated for their exceptional performance, we ask:How can unlearning be performed effectively and efficiently on MoE LLMs? Our pilot study shows that the dynamic routing nature of MoE LLMs introduces unique challenges, leading to excessive forgetting, uncontrolled knowledge erasure and substantial utility drops when existing unlearning methods are applied. To address this, we propose a novel Selected-Expert Unlearning Framework (SEUF). Through expert attribution, unlearning is concentrated on the most actively engaged experts for the specified knowledge. Concurrently, an anchor loss is applied to the router to stabilize the active state of this targeted expert, ensuring focused and controlled unlearning. SEUF is compatible with various standard unlearning algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEUF enhances both forget quality up to 5% and model utility by 35% on MoE LLMs across various benchmarks and LLM architectures (compared to standard unlearning algorithms), while only unlearning 0.06% of the model parameters",

Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code snippets.The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the target code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies.We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through a graph-guided agent.By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures and their dependencies, enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning.Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization.Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10).

    "abstract": "Despite progress in comment-aware multimodal and multilingual summarization for English and Chinese, research in Indian languages remains limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing COSMMIC, a pioneering comment-sensitive multimodal, multilingual dataset featuring nine major Indian languages. COSMMIC comprises 4,959 article-image pairs and 24,484 reader comments, with ground-truth summaries available in all included languages. Our approach enhances summaries by integrating reader insights and feedback. We explore summarization and headline generation across four configurations: (1) using article text alone, (2) incorporating user comments, (3) utilizing images, and (4) combining text, comments, and images. To assess the dataset's effectiveness, we employ state-of-the-art language models such as LLama3 and GPT-4. We conduct a comprehensive study to evaluate different component combinations, including identifying supportive comments, filtering out noise using a dedicated comment classifier using IndicBERT, and extracting valuable insights from images with a multilingual CLIP-based classifier. This helps determine the most effective configurations for natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Unlike many existing datasets that are either text-only or lack user comments in multimodal settings, COSMMIC uniquely integrates text, images, and user feedback. This holistic approach bridges gaps in Indian language resources, advancing NLP research and fostering inclusivity",

    "abstract": "As AI chatbots become ubiquitous, voice interaction presents a compelling way to enable rapid, high-bandwidth communication for both semantic and social signals. This has driven research into Large Audio Models (LAMs) to power voice-native experiences. However, aligning LAM development with user goals requires a clear understanding of user needs and preferences to establish reliable progress metrics. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an interactive approach to evaluate LAMs and collecting 7,500 LAM interactions from 484 participants. Through topic modeling of user queries, we identify primary use cases for audio interfaces. We then analyze user preference rankings and qualitative feedback to determine which models best align with user needs. Finally, we evaluate how static benchmarks predict interactive performance - our analysis reveals no individual benchmark strongly correlates with interactive results (𝜏 ≤ 0.33 for all benchmarks). While combining multiple coarse-grained features yields modest predictive power (R2=0.30), only two out of twenty datasets on spoken question answering and age prediction show significantly positive correlations. This suggests a clear need to develop LAM evaluations that better correlate with user preferences",

To remove any prior knowledge of Manchu encoded in the LLM parameters and single out the effect of ICL, we also experiment with an enciphered version of Manchu texts.Our results indicate that high-quality dictionaries and good parallel examples are very helpful, while grammars hardly help.In a follow-up study, we showcase a promising application of in-context MT: parallel data augmentation as a way to bootstrap a conventional MT model. When monolingual data abound, generating synthetic parallel data through in-context MT offers a pathway to mitigate data scarcity and build effective and efficient low-resource neural MT systems",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has introduced unprecedented challenges in fake news detection due to benchmark data contamination (BDC), where evaluation benchmarks are inadvertently memorized during the pre-training, leading to the inflated performance metrics. Traditional evaluation paradigms, reliant on static datasets and closed-world assumptions, fail to account the BDC risk in large-scale pre-training of current LLMs. This paper introduces TripleFact, a novel evaluation framework for fake news detection task, which designed to mitigate BDC risk while prioritizing real-world applicability. TripleFact integrates three components: (1) Human-Adversarial Preference Testing (HAPT) to assess robustness against human-crafted misinformation, (2) Real-Time Web Agent with Asynchronous Validation (RTW-AV) to evaluate temporal generalization using dynamically sourced claims, and (3) Entity-Controlled Virtual Environment (ECVE) to eliminate entity-specific biases. Through experiments on 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek variants, TripleFact demonstrates superior contamination resistance compared to traditional benchmarks. Results reveal that BDC artificially inflates performance by up to 23% in conventional evaluations, while TripleFact Score (TFS) remain stable within 4% absolute error under controlled contamination. The framework's ability to disentangle genuine detection capabilities from memorization artifacts underscores its potential as a fake news detection benchmark for the LLM era",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been found to struggle with systematic reasoning. Even on tasks where they appear to perform well, their performance often depends on shortcuts, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities, leading them to collapse on out-of-distribution (OOD) examples. Post-training strategies based on reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought prompting have recently been hailed as a step change. However, little is known about the potential of the resulting \"Large Reasoning Models\" (LRMs) beyond maths and programming-based problem solving, where genuine OOD problems can be sparse. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic relational composition for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. The setting allows fine control over problem difficulty to precisely measure OOD generalization. We find that, zero-shot LRMs generally outperform their LLM counterparts in single-path reasoning tasks but struggle in the multi-path setting. Whilst showing comparatively better results, fine-tuned LLMs are also not capable of multi-path generalization. We also provide evidence for the behavioral interpretation for this, i.e., that LRMs are shallow disjunctive reasoners",

    "abstract": "Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategies for sequence-to-sequence tasks often train models to directly generate the target output. Recent work has shown that guiding models with intermediate steps—such as keywords, outlines, or reasoning chains—can significantly improve performance, coherence, and interpretability. However, these methods often depend on predefined intermediate formats and annotated data, limiting their scalability and generalizability. In this work, we introduce a task-agnostic framework that enables models to generate intermediate \"warmup\" sequences. These warmup sequences, serving as an initial state for subsequent generation, are optimized to enhance the probability of generating the target sequence without relying on external supervision or human-designed structures. Drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles, our method iteratively refines these intermediate steps to maximize their contribution to the final output, similar to reward-driven optimization in reinforcement learning with human feedback. Experimental results across tasks such as translation, summarization, and multi-choice question answering for logical reasoning show that our approach outperforms traditional SFT methods, and offers a scalable and flexible solution for sequence-to-sequence tasks",

Rigorous data collection and labeling practices are essential for developing more human-centered and socially aware technologies. Although there has been growing interest in under-resourced languages within the NLP community, work in this area faces unique challenges, such as data scarcity and limited access to qualified annotators.In this paper, we collect feedback from individuals directly involved in and impacted by NLP artefacts for medium- and low-resource languages. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses of their responses and highlight key issues related to: (1) data quality, including linguistic and cultural appropriateness; and (2) the ethics of common annotation practices, such as the misuse of participatory research.

A granular, skill-specific understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1) improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without SkillVerse",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval from graph data is crucial for augmenting large language models (LLM) with both open-domain knowledge and private enterprise data, and it is also a key component in the recent GraphRAG system (CITATION). Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping and ambiguous relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics",

While social media platforms offer rich data for mental health screening, computational approaches often bypass these established clinical assessment tools in favor of black-box classification. We propose a novel questionnaire-guided screening framework that bridges psychological practice and computational methods through adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (aRAG). Our approach links unstructured social media content and standardized clinical assessments by retrieving relevant posts for each questionnaire item and using Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete validated psychological instruments. Our findings demonstrate two key advantages of questionnaire-guided screening: First, when completing the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), our approach matches or outperforms state-of-the-art performance on Reddit-based benchmarks without requiring training data. Second, we show that guiding LLMs through standardized questionnaires yields superior results compared to directly prompting them for depression screening. Additionally, we show as a proof-of-concept how our questionnaire-based methodology successfully extends to self-harm screening",

Circuit stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning process–its circuit–across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize and predict different aspects of generalization.

Through extensive experiments using models of varying size from four different families and six diverse datasets assessing text quality evaluation and common sense reasoning, we demonstrate that both supervised and unsupervised probing approaches consistently outperform traditional generation-based judgement while maintaining similar computational costs. These probes generalise under domain shifts and can even outperform finetuned evaluators with the same training data size. Our results suggest linear probing offers an accurate, robust and computationally efficient approach for LLM-as-judge tasks while providing interpretable insights into how models encode judgement-relevant knowledge.

    "abstract": "Social biases can manifest in language agency. However, very limited research has investigated such biases in Large Language Model (LLM)-generated content. In addition, previous works often rely on string-matching techniques to identify agentic and communal words within texts, falling short of accurately classifying language agency. We introduce the **Language Agency Bias Evaluation (LABE)** benchmark, which comprehensively evaluates biases in LLMs by analyzing agency levels attributed to different demographic groups in model generations. LABE tests for gender, racial, and intersectional language agency biases in LLMs on 3 text generation tasks: biographies, professor reviews, and reference letters. Using LABE, we unveil language agency social biases in 3 recent LLMs: ChatGPT, Llama3, and Mistral. We observe that: (1) LLM generations tend to demonstrate greater gender bias than human-written texts; (2) Models demonstrate remarkably higher levels of intersectional bias than the other bias aspects. (3) Prompt-based mitigation is unstable and frequently leads to bias exacerbation. Based on our observations, we propose **Mitigation via Selective Rewrite (MSR)**, a novel bias mitigation strategy that leverages an agency classifier to identify and selectively revise parts of generated texts that demonstrate communal traits. Empirical results prove MSR to be more effective and reliable than prompt-based mitigation method, showing a promising research direction",

Furthermore, as modern slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation. AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels, enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in compliance monitoring.

    "abstract": "Dense retrieval models are commonly used in Information Retrieval (IR) applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Since they often serve as the first step in these systems, their robustness is critical to avoid downstream failures. In this work, we repurpose a relation extraction dataset (e.g., Re-DocRED) to design controlled experiments that quantify the impact of heuristic biases, such as a preference for shorter documents, on retrievers like Dragon+ and Contriever. We uncover major vulnerabilities, showing retrievers favor shorter documents, early positions, repeated entities, and literal matches, all while ignoring the answer's presence! Notably, when multiple biases combine, models exhibit catastrophic performance degradation, selecting the answer-containing document in less than 10% of cases over a synthetic biased document without the answer. Furthermore, we show that these biases have direct consequences for downstream applications like RAG, where retrieval-preferred documents can mislead LLMs, resulting in a 34% performance drop than providing no documents at all.https://huggingface.co/datasets/mohsenfayyaz/ColDeR",

    "abstract": "Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the **Paired Stereotype Test (PST)** framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. \"a CEO\" and \"an Assistant\"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases – the well-known **bias in gendered occupation** and a novel aspect: **bias in organizational power**. Experiments show that **over 74% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases**. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose **FairCritic**, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches",

This reliance hinders generalization on minority examples, where such correlations do not hold. Existing shortcut mitigation approaches are model-specific, difficult to tune, computationally expensive, and fail to improve learned representations. To address these issues, we propose InterpoLated Learning (InterpoLL) which interpolates the representations of majority examples to include features from intra-class minority examples with shortcut-mitigating patterns. This weakens shortcut influence, enabling models to acquire features predictive across both minority and majority examples. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding tasks demonstrate that InterpoLL improves minority generalization over both ERM and state-of-the-art mitigation methods, without compromising accuracy on majority examples.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models have significantly advanced performance across various natural language processing tasks. However, adversarial attacks continue to pose a critical challenge to system built using these models, as they can be exploited with carefully crafted adversarial texts. Inspired by the ability of diffusion models to predict and reduce noise in computer vision, we propose a novel and flexible adversarial defense method for language classification tasks, DiffuseDef, which incorporates a diffusion layer as a denoiser between the encoder and the classifier. The diffusion layer is trained on top of the existing classifier, ensuring seamless integration with any model in a plug-and-play manner. During inference, the adversarial hidden state is first combined with sampled noise, then denoised iteratively and finally ensembled to produce a robust text representation. By integrating adversarial training, denoising, and ensembling techniques, we show that DiffuseDef improves over existing adversarial defense methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance against common black-box and white-box adversarial attacks",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomic technologies enable measuring gene expression profile and spatial information of cells in tissues simultaneously. Clustering of captured cells/spots in the spatial transcriptomic data is crucial for understanding tissue niches and uncovering disease-related changes.Current methods to cluster spatial transcriptomic data encounter obstacles, including inefficiency in handling multi-replicate data, lack of prior knowledge incorporation, and producing uninterpretable cluster labels.We introduce a novel approach, LLMiniST, to identify spatial niche using a zero-shot large language models (LLMs) by transforming spatial transcriptomic data into spatial context prompts, leveraging gene expression of neighboring cells/spots, cell type composition, tissue information, and external knowledge. The model was further enhanced using a two-stage fine-tuning strategy for improved generalizability. We also develop a user-friendly annotation tool to accelerate the creation of well-annotated spatial dataset for fine-tuning.Comprehensive method performance evaluations showed that both zero-shot and fine-tunned LLMiniST had superior performance than current non-LLM methods in many circumstances. Notably, the two-stage fine-tuning strategy facilitated substantial cross-subject generalizability. The results demonstrate the feasibility of LLMs for tissue niche identification using spatial transcriptomic data and the potential of LLMs as a scalable solution to efficiently integrate minimal human guidance for improved performance in large-scale datasets",

To bridge this gap, we introduce Bitnet.cpp, an inference system optimized for BitNet b1.58 and ternary LLMs. Given that mixed-precision matrix multiplication (mpGEMM) constitutes the bulk of inference time in ternary LLMs, Bitnet.cpp incorporates a novel mpGEMM library to facilitate sub-2-bits-per-weight, efficient and lossless inference. The library features two core solutions: Ternary Lookup Table (TL), which addresses spatial inefficiencies of previous bit-wise methods, and Int2 with a Scale (I2_S), which ensures lossless edge inference, both enabling high-speed inference. Our experiments show that Bitnet.cpp achieves up to a 6.25x increase in speed over full-precision baselines and up to 2.32x over low-bit baselines, setting new benchmarks in the field. Additionally, we expand TL to element-wise lookup table (ELUT) for low-bit LLMs in the appendix, presenting both theoretical and empirical evidence of its considerable potential.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning is widely recognized as a crucial process for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, the substantial memory requirements associated with fine-tuning pose a significant barrier to extending the applicability of LLMs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning can be a promising approach by reducing trainable parameters, intermediate activations still need to be cached to compute gradients during the backward pass, thereby limiting overall memory efficiency. In this work, we propose Saliency-Guided Gradient Flow (SAGE), a memory-efficient fine-tuning method designed to minimize the memory specifically associated with cached intermediate activations. The key strategy is to selectively cache activations based on their saliency during the forward pass and then use these activations for the backward pass. This process transforms the dense backward pass into a sparse one, thereby enhancing memory efficiency. To verify whether SAGE can serve as an efficient alternative for fine-tuning, we conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse fine-tuning scenarios and setups. The experimental results show that SAGE substantially improves memory efficiency without a significant loss in accuracy, highlighting its broad value in real-world applications",

This has led to the development of various personalized approaches aimed at adapting large language models (LLMs) to generate customized outputs aligned with user preferences. Some of them involve fine-tuning a unique personalized LLM for each user, which is too expensive for widespread application. Alternative approaches introduce personalization information in a plug-and-play manner by retrieving the user's relevant historical texts as demonstrations. However, this retrieval-based strategy may break the continuity of the user history and fail to capture the user's overall styles and patterns, hence leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized LLM model, PPlug. It constructs a user-specific embedding for each individual by modeling all her historical contexts through a lightweight plug-in user embedder module. By attaching this embedding to the task input, LLMs can better understand and capture user habits and preferences, thereby producing more personalized outputs without tuning their parameters. Extensive experiments on various tasks in the language model personalization (LaMP) benchmark demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing personalized LLM approaches",

Targeted syntactic evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods without memory constraints or with static memory constraints.

Our hybrid causal discovery method combines statistical algorithms and LLM-based methods to discover known and novel causal relations.

In this paper, we introduce \"INJONGO\" - a multicultural, open-source benchmark dataset for 16 African languages with utterances generated by native speakers across diverse domains, including banking, travel, home, and dining. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark fine-tuning multilingual transformer models and prompting large language models (LLMs), and show the advantage of leveraging African-cultural utterances over Western-centric utterances for improving cross-lingual transfer from the English language. Experimental results reveal that current LLMs struggle with the slot-filling task, with GPT-4o achieving an average performance of 26 F1. In contrast, intent detection performance is notably better, with an average accuracy of 70.6%, though it still falls short of fine-tuning baselines. When compared to the English language, GPT-4o and fine-tuning baselines perform similarly on intent detection, achieving an accuracy of approximately 81%.

For information-seeking tasks, full context perception is often unnecessary, as a query's information needs can dynamically range from localized details to a global perspective, depending on its complexity. However, existing methods struggle to adapt effectively to this dynamic information needs.In the paper, we propose a method for processing long-context information-seeking tasks via query-guided ACtivation REfilling (ACRE). ACRE constructs a Bi-layer KV Cache for long contexts, where the layer-1 (L1) cache compactly captures global information, and the layer-2 (L2) cache provides detailed, localized information. ACRE establishes a proxying relationship between the two caches, allowing the input query to attend to the L1 cache and dynamically refill it with relevant entries from the L2 cache. This mechanism integrates global understanding with query-specific local details, thereby enhancing answer decoding. Experiments on a variety of long-context information-seeking datasets demonstrate ACRE's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in both performance and efficiency",

To address these issues, we propose a novel method named AdaDHP with fewer parameters and finer granularity, which can adaptively select important parameters for each task. Specifically, we introduce two trainable vectors for each parameter and fine-tune the parameters through Hadamard product along both rows and columns. This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, with our parameter count capped at the lower limit of LoRA. Moreover, we design an adaptive parameter selection strategy to select important parameters for downstream tasks dynamically. This allows our method to flexibly remove unimportant parameters for downstream tasks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) addresses the memory footprint issue of full fine-tuning by modifying only a subset of model parameters. However, on datasets exhibiting spurious correlations, we observed that PEFT slows down the model's convergence on unbiased examples, while the convergence on biased examples remains fast. This leads to the model's overfitting on biased examples, causing significant performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Traditional debiasing methods mitigate this issue by emphasizing unbiased examples during training but often come at the cost of in-distribution (ID) performance drops. To address this trade-off issue, we propose a curriculum debiasing framework that presents examples in a biased-to-unbiased order. Our framework initially limits the model's exposure to unbiased examples, which are harder to learn, allowing it to first establish a foundation on easier-to-converge biased examples. As training progresses, we gradually increase the proportion of unbiased examples in the training set, guiding the model away from reliance on spurious correlations. Compared to the original PEFT methods, our method accelerates convergence on unbiased examples by approximately twofold and improves ID and OOD performance by 1.2% and 8.0%, respectively",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the demand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI system development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models—LLMs finetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs—have been touted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on non-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of contextual settings—those where external information is used as context to generate an output—is surprising given the increasing prevalence of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual assessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner priorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing responses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are equally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge benchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by real-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a multi-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human annotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11 judge models and 7 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual information and assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even state-of-the-art models. For example, o1, the best-performing model, barely reaches 55% consistent accuracy",

Using newly available open-source LLMs, OLMo and BLOOM, which provide access to their pre-training corpora, we investigate how LLMs address causal discovery through three research questions. We examine: (i) the impact of memorization for accurate causal relation prediction, (ii) the influence of incorrect causal relations in pre-training data, and (iii) the contextual nuances that influence LLMs' understanding of causal relations. Our findings indicate that while LLMs are effective in recognizing causal relations that occur frequently in pre-training data, their ability to generalize to new or rare causal relations is limited. Moreover, the presence of incorrect causal relations significantly undermines the confidence of LLMs in corresponding correct causal relations, and the contextual information critically affects the outcomes of LLMs to discern causal connections between random variables",

    "abstract": "The recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope of multimodal applications. However, evaluations often remain limited to functional tasks, neglecting abstract dimensions such as personality traits and human values. To address this gap, we introduce Value-Spectrum, a novel Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark aimed at assessing VLMs based on Schwartz's value dimensions that capture core human values guiding people's preferences and actions. We design a VLM agent pipeline to simulate video browsing and construct a vector database comprising over 50,000 short videos from TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. These videos span multiple months and cover diverse topics, including family, health, hobbies, society, technology, etc. Benchmarking on Value-Spectrum highlights notable variations in how VLMs handle value-oriented content. Beyond identifying VLMs' intrinsic preferences, we also explore the ability of VLM agents to adopt specific personas when explicitly prompted, revealing insights into the adaptability of the model in role-playing scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of Value-Spectrum as a comprehensive evaluation set for tracking VLM preferences in value-based tasks and abilities to simulate diverse personas.

Existing methods to evaluate privacy leakage in LLMs often use memorized prefixes or simple instructions to extract data, both of which well-alignment models can easily block.

In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks in extracting sensitive information, bridging privacy leakage and jailbreak attacks in LLMs. Moreover, we propose PIG, a novel framework targeting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and addressing the limitations of current jailbreak methods.

We evaluate PIG and existing jailbreak methods using two privacy-related datasets. Experiments on four white-box and two black-box LLMs show that PIG outperforms baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results.

We design a permutation-invariant adversarial attack that optimizes prompt distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack path as a problem of maximum-flow minimum-cost, coupled with the novel Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL), we leverage graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing detection risk. Evaluating across models including Llama, Mistral, Gemma, DeepSeek and other variants on various datasets like JailBreakBench and AdversarialBench, our method outperforms conventional attacks by up to 7×, exposing critical vulnerabilities in multi-agent systems.

    "abstract": "With the increasing prominence of large language models (LLMs), evaluating their text-generation capabilities has become an essential research challenge. Although LLM-based evaluation methods exhibit robust performance, the inherent stochastic nature of the LLM generation process introduces a degree of uncertainty in alignment with human preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Semantic-Eval, the first training-free framework designed to assess LLM-generated text based on semantic understanding. This framework computes semantic similarity between pairwise texts to evaluate the interdependence of semantic units, integrating a graph-based weighting mechanism to account for the differential contributions of individual sentences. A pre-trained natural language inference (NLI) model is also incorporated to mitigate potential semantic relationship biases. We evaluate Semantic-Eval across eight datasets that encompass four common NLP tasks. The experimental results indicate that Semantic-Eval surpasses traditional N-gram and BERT-based evaluation metrics, aligning more closely with human judgments and demonstrating a higher correlation than smaller LLMs. However, it slightly lags behind GPT-4. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Semantic-Eval in evaluating the generation quality of 13 large language models.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Pretraining language models on formal language can improve their acquisition of natural language. Which features of the formal language impart an inductive bias that leads to effective transfer? Drawing on insights from linguistics and complexity theory, we hypothesize that effective transfer occurs when two conditions are met: the formal language should capture the dependency structures present in natural language, and it should remain within the computational limitations of the model architecture. We experiment with pre-pretraining (training on formal language before natural languages) on transformers and find that formal languages capturing hierarchical dependencies indeed enable language models to achieve lower loss on natural language and better linguistic generalization compared to other formal languages. We also find modest support for the hypothesis that the formal language should fall within the computational limitations of the architecture. Strikingly, pre-pretraining reduces loss more efficiently than training on a matched amount of natural language. For a 1B-parameter language model trained on roughly 1.6B tokens of natural language, pre-pretraining achieves the same loss and better linguistic generalization with a 33% smaller token budget. Finally, we also give mechanistic evidence of transfer from formal tonatural language: attention heads acquired during pre-pretraining remain crucial for the model's performance on syntactic evaluations",

Addressing this limitation, we propose Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a novel training-free decoding method that allows LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA estimates the relevance of both knowledge sources for a given input, adaptively deciding which type of information to prioritize and which to exclude.

Extensive experiments on four malicious social text detection tasks with ten datasets illustrate that evidence pollution significantly compromises detectors, where the generating strategy causes up to a 14.4% performance drop. Meanwhile, the defense strategies could mitigate evidence pollution, but they faced limitations for practical employment. Further analysis illustrates that polluted evidence (i) is of high quality, evaluated by metrics and humans; (ii) would compromise the model calibration, increasing expected calibration error up to 21.6%; and (iii) could be integrated to amplify the negative impact, especially for encoder-based LMs, where the accuracy drops by 21.8%",

    "abstract": "Homans' Social Exchange Theory (SET) is widely recognized as a basic framework for understanding the formation and emergence of human civilizations and social structures. In social science, this theory is typically studied based on simple simulation experiments or real-world human studies, both of which either lack realism or are too expensive to control. In artificial intelligence, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in simulating human behaviors. Inspired by these insights, we adopt an interdisciplinary research perspective and propose using LLM-based agents to study Homans' SET. Specifically, we construct a virtual society composed of three LLM agents and have them engage in a social exchange game to observe their behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we found that Homans' SET is well validated in our agent society, demonstrating the consistency between the agent and human behaviors. Building on this foundation, we intentionally alter the settings of the agent society to extend the traditional Homans' SET, making it more comprehensive and detailed. To the best of our knowledge, this paper marks the first step in studying Homans' SET with LLM-based agents. More importantly, it introduces a novel and feasible research paradigm that bridges the fields of social science and computer science through LLM-based agents.

Various strategies have been developed to enhance the end-to-end inference speed for LLMs, one of which is speculative decoding. This technique involves running a smaller LLM (draft model) for inference over a defined window size, denoted as 𝛾, while simultaneously being validated by the larger LLM (target model). Choosing the optimal 𝛾 value and the draft model is essential for unlocking the potential of speculative decoding. But it is difficult to do due to the complicated influence from various factors, including the nature of the task, the hardware in use, and the combination of the large and small models. This paper introduces *on-the-fly adaption of speculative decoding*, a solution that dynamically adapts the choices to maximize the efficiency of speculative decoding for LLM inferences. As a drop-in solution, it needs no offline benchmarking or training.

In this paper, we investigate whether the attention mechanism of Transformer Grammar (TG), which uniquely operates on syntactic structures as representational units, can serve as a cognitive model of human memory retrieval, using Normalized Attention Entropy (NAE) as a linking hypothesis between models and humans. Our experiments demonstrate that TG's attention achieves superior predictive power for self-paced reading times compared to vanilla Transformer's, with further analyses revealing independent contributions from both models. These findings suggest that human sentence processing involves dual memory representations—one based on syntactic structures and another on token sequences—with attention serving as the general memory retrieval algorithm, while highlighting the importance of incorporating syntactic structures as representational units",

    "abstract": "Large language models have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of language tasks, owing to their exceptional capabilities in context modeling. The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective mechanisms. Experiments on various tasks reveal that these methods effectively lower irregular attention entropy and narrow performance gaps.

A well-designed draft model and an effective draft candidate tree construction method are key to enhancing the acceleration effect of SD.

Furthermore, we use KL divergence instead of the standard cross-entropy loss to better align the draft model's output with the LLM. Next, we introduce the Pruned Candidate Tree (PCT) algorithm to construct a more efficient candidate tree. Specifically, we found that the confidence scores predicted by the draft model are well-calibrated with the acceptance probability of draft tokens. Therefore, PCT estimates the expected time gain for each node in the candidate tree based on confidence scores and retains only the nodes that contribute to acceleration, pruning away redundant nodes.

The experts are then merged to create task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically merging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across various domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or removed conveniently, leading to great scalability.

A major challenge in student simulation is modeling the diverse learning patterns of students at various cognitive levels. However, current LLMs, typically trained as \"helpful assistants\", target at generating perfect responses. As a result, they struggle to simulate students with diverse cognitive abilities, as they often produce overly advanced answers, missing the natural imperfections that characterize student learning and resulting in unrealistic simulations. To address this issue, we propose a training-free framework for student simulation. We begin by constructing a cognitive prototype for each student using a knowledge graph, which captures their understanding of concepts from past learning records. This prototype is then mapped to new tasks to predict student performance. Next, we simulate student solutions based on these predictions and iteratively refine them using a beam search method to better replicate realistic mistakes. To validate our approach, we construct the Student_100 dataset, consisting of 100 students working on Python programming and 5,000 learning records. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving 100% improvement in simulation accuracy and realism",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided design (CAD) is crucial in prototyping 3D objects through geometric instructions (i.e., CAD programs). In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications",

However, many existing speech deepfake datasets are limited in scale and diversity, making it challenging to train models that can generalize well to unseen deepfakes. To address these gaps, we introduce SpeechFake, a large-scale dataset designed specifically for speech deepfake detection. SpeechFake includes over 3 million deepfake samples, totaling more than 3,000 hours of audio, generated using 40 different speech synthesis tools. The dataset encompasses a wide range of generation techniques, including text-to-speech, voice conversion, and neural vocoder, incorporating the latest cutting-edge methods. It also provides multilingual support, spanning 46 languages. In this paper, we offer a detailed overview of the dataset's creation, composition, and statistics. We also present baseline results by training detection models on SpeechFake, demonstrating strong performance on both its own test sets and various unseen test sets. Additionally, we conduct experiments to rigorously explore how generation methods, language diversity, and speaker variation affect detection performance. We believe SpeechFake will be a valuable resource for advancing speech deepfake detection and developing more robust models for evolving generation techniques",

    "abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior is a critical challenge in behavioral finance, which grapples with a fundamental limitation: the scarcity of real-user data needed for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). While SFT can bridge the gap between LLM outputs and human behavioral patterns, its reliance on massive authentic data imposes substantial collection costs and privacy risks. We propose **InvestAlign**, a novel framework that constructs high-quality SFT datasets by leveraging theoretical solutions to similar and simple optimal investment problems rather than the complex scenarios. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that training LLMs with **InvestAlign**-generated data achieves faster parameter convergence than using real-user data, suggesting superior learning efficiency. Furthermore, we develop **InvestAgent**, an LLM agent fine-tuned with **InvestAlign**, which shows significantly closer alignment to real-user data than pre-SFT models in both simple and complex investment problems. This highlights our proposed **InvestAlign** as a promising approach with the potential to address complex optimal investment problems and align LLMs with investor decision-making processes under herd behavior.

Our approach generates a probability distribution over these sentences during decoding, and this distribution is then interpolated with the NMT model's distribution. Additionally, we introduce an n-gram-based approach to focus on similar fragments, enabling the model to avoid the noise introduced by the non-similar parts. To enhance accuracy, we further incorporate cross-lingual retrieval similarity to refine the kNN probability distribution. Extensive experiments on multi-domain datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements in both high-resource and low-resource scenarios.

    "abstract": "Generative Retrieval (GR) introduces a new information retrieval paradigm that directly generates unique document identifiers (DocIDs). The key challenge of GR lies in creating effective yet discrete DocIDs that preserve semantic relevance for similar documents while differentiating dissimilar ones. However, existing methods generate DocIDs solely based on the textual content of documents, which may result in DocIDs with weak semantic connections for similar documents due to variations in expression. Therefore, we propose using queries as a bridge to connect documents with varying relevance levels for learning improved DocIDs. In this paper, we propose **M**ulti-l**E**vel **R**elevance document identifier learning for **G**enerative r**E**trieval (MERGE), a novel approach that utilizes multi-level document relevance to learn high-quality DocIDs. MERGE incorporates three modules: a multi-relevance query-document alignment module to effectively align document representations with related queries, an outer-level contrastive learning module to capture binary-level relevance, and an inner-level multi-level relevance learning module to distinguish documents with different relevance levels. Our approach encodes rich hierarchical semantic information and maintains uniqueness across documents. Experimental results on real-world multilingual e-commerce search datasets demonstrate that MERGE significantly outperforms existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are crucial in modern natural language processing and artificial intelligence. However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41).

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the *same* vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs *perceive more*—as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs",

To address this limitation, we introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA. DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8% accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8% accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B.

Despite the novelty and unique properties of this concept, it has not been rigorously defined and systematically studied. Our contributions are: (1) We pioneer the study of structures in knowledge neurons by analyzing weight connection patterns, providing a comprehensive definition of DKNs from both functional and structural aspects. (2) Based on this definition, we develop the **Neuronal Topology Clustering** method, leading to a more accurate DKN identification. (3) We demonstrate the practical applications of DKNs in two aspects: guiding LLMs to learn new knowledge and relating to LLMs' robustness against input errors",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with external contexts, such as through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), often face challenges in handling imperfect evidence. They tend to over-rely on external knowledge, making them vulnerable to misleading and unhelpful contexts. To address this, we propose the concept of context-robust LLMs, which can effectively balance internal knowledge with external context, similar to human cognitive processes. Specifically, context-robust LLMs should rely on external context only when lacking internal knowledge, identify contradictions between internal and external knowledge, and disregard unhelpful contexts. To achieve this goal, we introduce Grft, a lightweight and plug-and-play gated representation fine-tuning approach. Grft consists of two key components: a gating mechanism to detect and filter problematic inputs, and low-rank representation adapters to adjust hidden representations. By training a lightweight intervention function with only 0.0004% of model size on fewer than 200 examples, Grft can effectively adapt LLMs towards context-robust behaviors",

    "abstract": "Language models excel in various tasks by making complex decisions, yet understanding the rationale behind these decisions remains a challenge. This paper investigates data-centric interpretability in language models, focusing on the next-word prediction task. Using representer theorem, we identify two types of support samples—those that either promote or deter specific predictions. Our findings reveal that being a support sample is an intrinsic property, predictable even before training begins. Additionally, while non-support samples are less influential in direct predictions, they play a critical role in preventing overfitting and shaping generalization and representation learning. Notably, the importance of non-support samples increases in deeper layers, suggesting their significant role in intermediate representation formation.These insights shed light on the interplay between data and model decisions, offering a new dimension to understanding language model behavior and interpretability",

    "abstract": "The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about the misuse of AI-generated text, making watermarking a promising solution. Mainstream watermarking schemes for LLMs fall into two categories: logits-based and sampling-based. However, current schemes entail trade-offs among robustness, text quality, and security. To mitigate this, we integrate logits-based and sampling-based schemes, harnessing their respective strengths to achieve synergy. In this paper, we propose a versatile symbiotic watermarking framework with three strategies: serial, parallel, and hybrid. The hybrid framework adaptively embeds watermarks using token entropy and semantic entropy, optimizing the balance between detectability, robustness, text quality, and security. Furthermore, we validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

On fine-granularity, we perform token-aware preference optimization with dynamic token-level supervision. Our method is evaluated on open-sourced models, and experiment results show our method achieves significant improvement on both complex and general instruction-following benchmarks, surpassing previous self-alignment methods",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained extended context windows through scaling positional encodings and lightweight continual pre-training. However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining or even enhancing its long-context abilities",

Current approaches, including sequence parallelism strategies and compute reduction through approximate attention mechanisms, still fall short of delivering optimal inference efficiency. This hinders scaling the inputs to longer sequences and processing long-context queries in a timely manner. To address this, we introduce APB, an efficient long-context inference framework that leverages multi-host approximate attention to enhance prefill speed by reducing compute and enhancing parallelism simultaneously. APB introduces a communication mechanism for essential key-value pairs within a sequence parallelism framework, enabling a faster inference speed while maintaining task performance. We implement APB by incorporating a tailored FlashAttn kernel alongside optimized distribution strategies, supporting diverse models and parallelism configurations. APB achieves speedups of up to 9.2×, 4.2×, and 1.6× compared with FlashAttn, RingAttn, and StarAttn, respectively, without any observable task performance degradation",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Rich user-item interactions are essential for building reliable recommender systems, as they reflect user preference patterns. However, minor language news recommendation platforms suffer from limited interactions due to a small user base. A natural solution is to apply well-established English recommender systems to minor language news recommendation, but the linguistic gap can lead to inaccurate modeling of minor language news content. Therefore, enabling few-shot minor language news recommender systems to capture both content information and preference patterns remains a challenge. Based on the observation that preference patterns are similar across languages, we propose a minor language news recommendation model by cross-lingual preference pattern transfer, named PPT. Our model adopts the widely used two-tower architecture and employs the large language model as the backbone of the news encoder. Through cross-lingual alignment, the strong English capability of the news encoder is extended to minor languages, thus enhancing news content representations. Additionally, through cross-lingual news augmentation, PPT simulates interactions of minor language news in the English domain, which facilitates the transfer of preference patterns from the many-shot English domain to the few-shot minor language domain. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets across 15 minor languages demonstrate the superiority and generalization of our proposed PPT in addressing minor language news recommendation",

Some highly relevant passages may interfere with LLM reasoning because they contain complex or contradictory information; while some indirectly related or even inaccurate content may help LLM generate more accurate answers by providing suggestive information or logical clues. To solve this, we propose **GainRAG**, a novel approach that aligns the retriever's and LLM's preferences by defining a new metric, \"gain'', which measure how well an input passage contributes to correct outputs.We then propose a method to estimate these gain signals and train a middleware that aligns the preferences of the retriever and the LLM using only limited data.In addition, we introduce a pseudo-passage strategy to mitigate degradation.The experimental results on 6 datasets verify the effectiveness of GainRAG",

This limitation stems from their reliance on probability-based metrics that are inherently sensitive to temperature scaling. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we make two key discoveries: (1) the pre-softmax logits exhibit a clear statistical separation between informative tokens and noise, and (2) we prove the mathematical equivalence of min-p and top-(1-p) under uniform distribution over logits. These findings motivate the design of top-n𝜎, a novel sampling method that identifies informative tokens by eliminating noise directly in logit space.Unlike existing methods that become unstable at high temperatures, top-n𝜎 achieves temperature-invariant token selection while preserving output diversity.

Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies.

In this paper, we propose MoQAE, a novel mixed-precision quantization method via mixture of quantization-aware experts. First, we view different quantization bit-width configurations as experts and use the traditional mixture of experts (MoE) method to select the optimal configuration. To avoid the inefficiency caused by inputting tokens one by one into the router in the traditional MoE method, we input the tokens into the router chunk by chunk. Second, we design a lightweight router-only fine-tuning process to train MoQAE with a comprehensive loss to learn the trade-off between model accuracy and memory usage. Finally, we introduce a routing freezing (RF) and a routing sharing (RS) mechanism to further reduce the inference overhead.

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection with performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference for the client-server scenario. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span type offline and then releases them to the clients. During inference, the client aggregates restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the user query into a meta restoration vector, which is later sent to the server to restore information. Before transmission, the client removes all privacy spans in the user query and applies d𝜒-privacy mechanism to the meta vector for privacy protection. We prove that our method can inherently prevent the linear growth of the privacy budget. We conduct extensive experimental, covering the medical and legal domains, and demonstrate that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintains acceptable levels of performance and inference efficiency",

Current data selection methods, such as natural language quality assessments, diversity-based filters, and classifier-based approaches, are limited by single-dimensional evaluation or redundancy-focused strategies. To address these gaps, we propose four dimensions to evaluate data quality: professionalism, readability, reasoning, and cleanliness. We further introduce Meta-rater, a multi-dimensional data selection method that integrates these dimensions with existing quality metrics through learned optimal weightings. Meta-rater employs proxy models to train a regression model that predicts validation loss, enabling the identification of optimal combinations of quality scores. Experiments demonstrate that Meta-rater doubles convergence speed for 1.3B parameter models and improves downstream task performance by 3.23%, with advantages that scale to models as large as 7.2B parameters.

This paper presents a sample-efficient human evaluation method for LLMs based on the principle of MAximum Discrepancy (MAD) competition. MAD automatically selects a small set of informative input instructions, each of which maximizes the discrepancy of two LLMs' reponses, which are subsequently subject to three-alternative forced choice by human subjects. The pairwise comparison results of multiple LLMs are then aggregated into a global ranking using the Elo rating system. We compare eight representative LLMs in terms of four skills: knowledge understanding, mathematical reasoning, writing, and coding.

However, summary trees often contain a large number of redundant summary nodes, which not only increase construction time but may also negatively impact question answering. Moreover, recursive summarization is not suitable for all types of questions. We introduce DTCRS, a method that dynamically generates summary trees based on document structure and query semantics. DTCRS determines whether a summary tree is necessary by analyzing the question type. It then decomposes the question and uses the embeddings of sub-questions as initial cluster centers, reducing redundant summaries while improving the relevance between summaries and the question.

In this paper, we propose a Deep Generative Adaptive Replay (DGAR) method, which can generate and adaptively replay historical entity distribution representations from the whole historical context. To address the first challenge, historical context prompts as sampling units are built to preserve the whole historical context information. To overcome the second challenge, a pre-trained diffusion model is adopted to generate the historical distribution. During the generation process, the common features between the historical and current distributions are enhanced under the guidance of the TKGR model.

In this work, we propose a novel pairwise knowledge-augmented generative method (termed PKAG-DDI) for DDIE text generation. It consists of a pairwise knowledge selector efficiently injecting structural information between drugs bidirectionally and simultaneously to select pairwise biological functions from the knowledge set, and a pairwise knowledge integration strategy that matches and integrates the selected biological functions into the LM.

Key innovations include a sequential rationale distillation framework that equips SLMs with LLM-comparable multimodal reasoning abilities, and a knowledge-augmented attention mechanism that jointly unifies multimodal representation from time series and textual data in the same encoding space, enabling it to be naturally interpreted by SLMs while incorporating domain knowledge for reliable rationale generation. Experiments on real-world medical datasets show that ClinRaGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis and rationale generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLM-driven reasoning with knowledge augmentation for improved interpretability",

    "title": "TWIST: Text-encoder Weight-editing for Inserting Secret Trojans in Text-to-Image Models",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models excel at generating high-quality images from text via powerful text encoders but training these encoders demands substantial computational resources. Consequently, many users seek pre-trained text encoders from model plugin-sharing platforms like Civitai and Hugging Face, which introduces an underexplored threat: the potential for adversaries to embed Trojans within these plugins. Existing Trojan attacks often require extensive training data and suffer from poor generalization across different triggers, limiting their effectiveness and scalability. To the best of our knowledge, this paper introduces the first **T**ext-encoder **W**eight-editing method for **I**nserting **S**ecret **T**rojans (**TWIST**). By identifying the *bottleneck MLP layer*—the critical point where minimal edits can dominantly control cross-modal alignment—TWIST achieves training-free and data-free Trojan insertion, which makes it highly efficient and practical. The experimental results across various triggers demonstrate that TWIST attains an average attack success rate of 91%, a 78% improvement over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method proposed in 2024 and highlights the excellent generalization capability. Moreover, TWIST reduces modified parameters by 8-fold and cuts injection time to 25 seconds. Our findings underscore the security risks associated with text encoders in real-world applications and emphasize the need for more robust defense mechanisms",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "AI support of collaborative interactions entails mediating potential misalignment between interlocutor beliefs. Common preference alignment methods like DPO excel in static settings, but struggle in dynamic collaborative tasks where the explicit signals of interlocutor beliefs are sparse and skewed. We propose the Frictional Agent Alignment Framework (FAAF), to generate precise, context-aware \"friction\" that prompts for deliberation and re-examination of existing evidence. FAAF's two-player objective decouples from data skew: a frictive-state policy identifies belief misalignments, while an intervention policy crafts collaborator-preferred responses. We derive an analytical solution to this objective, enabling training a single policy via a simple supervised loss. Experiments on three benchmarks show FAAF outperforms competitors in producing concise, interpretable friction and in OOD generalization. By aligning LLMs to act as adaptive \"thought partners\"—not passive responders—FAAF advances scalable, dynamic human-AI collaboration.

In this work, to address these issues, we propose a multi-modal prompt learning paradigm to effectively adapt pre-trained GNN to downstream tasks and data, given only a few semantically labeled samples, each with extremely weak text supervision. Our new paradigm embeds the graphs directly in the same space as the Large Language Models (LLMs) by learning both graph prompts and text prompts simultaneously. We demonstrate the superior performance of our paradigm in few-shot, multi-task-level, and cross-domain settings.

Both are crucial to creating an enjoyable interactive experience, while they have been underexplored in previous work.

    "abstract": "Multimodal reference resolution, including phrase grounding, aims to understand the semantic relations between mentions and real-world objects. Phrase grounding between images and their captions is a well-established task. In contrast, for real-world applications, it is essential to integrate textual and multimodal reference resolution to unravel the reference relations within dialogue, especially in handling ambiguities caused by pronouns and ellipses. This paper presents a framework that unifies textual and multimodal reference resolution by mapping mention embeddings to object embeddings and selecting mentions or objects based on their similarity. Our experiments show that learning textual reference resolution, such as coreference resolution and predicate-argument structure analysis, positively affects performance in multimodal reference resolution. In particular, our model with coreference resolution performs better in pronoun phrase grounding than representative models for this task, MDETR and GLIP. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates that incorporating textual reference relations strengthens the confidence scores between mentions, including pronouns and predicates, and objects, which can reduce the ambiguities that arise in visually grounded dialogues",

Our experiments demonstrate that Ewe outperforms strong baselines on four fact-seeking long-form generation datasets, increasing the factuality metric, VeriScore, by 2 to 6 points absolute without sacrificing the helpfulness of the responses.

However, recent methods focus on search accuracy while overlooking computational efficiency. The challenges of accelerating the ToT lie in the frequent switching of reasoning focus, and the redundant exploration of suboptimal solutions. To alleviate this dilemma, we propose Dynamic Parallel Tree Search (DPTS), a novel parallelism framework that aims to dynamically optimize the reasoning path in inference. It includes the Parallelism Streamline in the generation phase to build up a flexible and adaptive parallelism with arbitrary paths by cache management and alignment. Meanwhile, the Search and Transition Mechanism filters potential candidates to dynamically maintain the reasoning focus on more possible solutions with less redundancy. Experiments on Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3 on math and code datasets show that DPTS significantly improves efficiency by 2-4× on average while maintaining or even surpassing existing reasoning algorithms in accuracy, making ToT-based reasoning more scalable and computationally efficient.

While encoding proteins themselves is essential, PPI networks can also provide rich prior knowledge for these predictive tasks. However, existing methods oversimplify the problem of PPI prediction in a semi-supervised manner when utilizing PPI networks, limiting their practical application. Furthermore, how to effectively use the rich prior knowledge of PPI networks for novel proteins not present in the network remains an unexplored issue. Additionally, due to inflexible architectures, most of existing methods cannot handle complexes containing an flexible number of proteins. To overcome these limitations, we introduce LLaPA (Large Language and Protein Assistant), a multimodal large language model that integrates proteins and PPI networks. LLaPA offers a more rational approach to utilizing PPI networks for PPI prediction and can fully exploit the information of PPI networks for unseen proteins. Through natural language instructions, LLaPA can accept flexible number of protein sequences and has the potential to perform various protein tasks.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong multi-lingual abilities, giving them the potential to perform M2MS in real applications. This work presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs' M2MS ability. Specifically, we first reorganize M2MS data based on eight previous domain-specific datasets. The reorganized data contains 47.8K samples spanning five domains and six languages, which could be used to train and evaluate LLMs. Then, we benchmark 18 LLMs in a zero-shot manner and an instruction-tuning manner. Fine-tuned traditional models (e.g., mBART) are also conducted for comparisons. Our experiments reveal that, zero-shot LLMs achieve competitive results with fine-tuned traditional models. After instruct-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their M2MS ability, and outperform zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) in terms of automatic evaluations. In addition, we demonstrate this task-specific improvement does not sacrifice the LLMs' general task-solving abilities. However, as revealed by our human evaluation, LLMs still face the factuality issue, and the instruction tuning might intensify the issue. Thus, how to control factual errors becomes the key when building LLM summarizers in real applications, and is worthy to be noted in future research",

To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Locate-and-Focus method for terminology translation.

Subsequently, it associates the translation knowledge with the utterance and hypothesis from both audio and textual modalities, allowing the ST model to better focus on translation knowledge during translation.

    "title": "GuideBench: Benchmarking Domain-Oriented Guideline Following for LLM Agents",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as autonomous agents capable of following user instructions and making decisions in real-world applications. Previous studies have made notable progress in benchmarking the instruction following capabilities of LLMs in general domains, with a primary focus on their inherent commonsense knowledge. Recently, LLMs have been increasingly deployed as domain-oriented agents, which rely on domain-oriented guidelines that may conflict with their commonsense knowledge. These guidelines exhibit two key characteristics: they consist of a wide range of domain-oriented rules and are subject to frequent updates. Despite these challenges, the absence of comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the domain-oriented guideline following capabilities of LLMs presents a significant obstacle to their effective assessment and further development. In this paper, we introduce GuideBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate guideline following performance of LLMs. GuideBench evaluates LLMs on three critical aspects: (i) adherence to diverse rules, (ii) robustness to rule updates, and (iii) alignment with human preferences. Experimental results on a range of LLMs indicate substantial opportunities for improving their ability to follow domain-oriented guidelines. Data and code are available at Anonymous",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "In the pursuit of enhancing domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising solution to mitigate issues such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and limited expertise in highly specialized queries. However, existing approaches to RAG fall short by neglecting system state variables, which are crucial for ensuring adaptive control, retrieval halting, and system convergence. In this paper, we introduce the Turing-Complete-RAG (TC-RAG) through rigorous proof, a novel framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating a Turing Complete System to manage state variables, thereby enabling more efficient and accurate knowledge retrieval. By leveraging a memory stack system with adaptive retrieval, reasoning, and planning capabilities, TC-RAG not only ensures the controlled halting of retrieval processes but also mitigates the accumulation of erroneous knowledge via Push and Pop actions. In the case study of the medical and general domain, our extensive experiments on seven real-world healthcare and general-domain datasets demonstrate the superiority of TC-RAG over existing methods in accuracy by over 7.20%.

    "abstract": "Mainstream issue-resolving frameworks predominantly rely on commercial models, leading to high costs and privacy concerns. Existing training approaches for issue resolving struggle with poor generalization and fail to fully leverage open-source development resources. We propose **S**ubtask-**o**riented **R**einforced **F**ine-**T**uning (**SoRFT**), a novel training approach to enhance the issue resolving capability of LLMs. We decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. SoRFT consists of two training stages: (1) **rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning**, Chain of Thought (CoT) data is filtered using ground-truth before fine-tuning the LLM, and (2) **rule-based reinforcement learning**, which leverages PPO with ground-truth based rewards. We evaluate the SoRFT-trained model on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among open-source models (e.g., resolve 21.4% issues on SWE-Bench Verified with SoRFT-Qwen-7B).

    "abstract": "Long Context Understanding (LCU) is a critical area for exploration in current large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherently lengthy nature of long-text data, existing LCU benchmarks for LLMs often result in prohibitively high evaluation costs, like testing time and inference expenses. Through extensive experimentation, we discover that existing LCU benchmarks exhibit significant redundancy, which means the inefficiency in evaluation. In this paper, we propose a concise data compression method tailored for long-text data with sparse information characteristics. By pruning the well-known LCU benchmark LongBench, we create MiniLongBench. This benchmark includes only 237 test samples across six major task categories and 21 distinct tasks. Through empirical analysis of over 60 LLMs, MiniLongBench achieves an average evaluation cost reduced to only 4.5% of the original while maintaining an average rank correlation coefficient of 0.97 with LongBench results. Therefore, our MiniLongBench, as a low-cost benchmark, holds great potential to substantially drive future research into the LCU capabilities of LLMs",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have significantly advanced natural language processing tasks by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling more accurate and contextually rich responses. To improve the robustness of such systems against noisy retrievals, Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) has emerged as a widely adopted method. However, RAFT conditions models to generate answers even in the absence of reliable knowledge. This behavior undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where acknowledging uncertainty is critical. To address this issue, we propose Divide-Then-Align (DTA), a post-training approach designed to endow RAG systems with the ability to respond with \"I don't know\" when the query is out of the knowledge boundary of both the retrieved passages and the model's internal knowledge. DTA divides data samples into four knowledge quadrants and constructs tailored preference data for each quadrant, resulting in a curated dataset for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that effectively balances accuracy with appropriate abstention, enhancing the reliability and trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented systems",

    "abstract": "Automatic exploit generation (AEG) refers to the automatic discovery and exploitation of vulnerabilities against unknown targets. Traditional AEG often targets a single type of vulnerability and still relies on templates built from expert experience. To achieve intelligent exploit generation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark using Binary Exploitation (pwn) challenges in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions and investigate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in AEG based on the benchmark. To improve the performance of AEG, we propose PwnGPT, an LLM-based automatic exploit generation framework that automatically solves pwn challenges. The structural design of PwnGPT is divided into three main components: analysis, generation, and verification modules. With the help of a modular approach and structured problem inputs, PwnGPT can solve challenges that LLMs cannot directly solve. We evaluate PwnGPT on our benchmark and analyze the outputs of each module. Experimental results show that our framework is highly autonomous and capable of addressing various challenges. Compared to direct input LLMs, PwnGPT increases the completion rate of exploit on our benchmark from 26.3% to 57.9% with the OpenAI o1-preview model and from 21.1% to 36.8% with the GPT-4o model",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture has become the standard LLM architecture due to its powerful self-attention mechanism. However, it suffers from quadratic computational complexity and linear memory complexity. RNN-based LLMs have been proposed as alternatives. Yet, RNN models struggle in long-context scenarios, making it challenging to replace self-attention with RNNs. We identify the state size as a critical bottleneck, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformers with a basic context length of 2k. However, simply increasing the state size significantly raises the number of parameters and lowers training efficiency. In this paper, we propose an efficient scaling method to scale the state size of RNN models to match the 2k context length of Transformers, with small parameters overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that scaling the state size significantly enhances long-context understanding. Retrieval performance scales almost linearly with state size, with a 454M model featuring an expanded state achieving performance comparable to a 1.47B model on FDA, a recall-intensive task. These findings highlight state scaling as a promising approach for advancing RNN-based LLMs",

    "title": "Unifying Continuous and Discrete Text Diffusion with Non-simultaneous Diffusion Processes",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a promising approach for text generation, with recent works falling into two main categories: discrete and continuous diffusion models. Discrete diffusion models apply token corruption independently using categorical distributions, allowing for different diffusion progress across tokens but lacking fine-grained control. Continuous diffusion models map tokens to continuous spaces and apply fine-grained noise, but the diffusion progress is uniform across tokens, limiting their ability to capture semantic nuances. To address these limitations, we propose Non-simultaneous Continuous Diffusion Models (NeoDiff), a novel diffusion model that integrates the strengths of both discrete and continuous approaches. NeoDiff introduces a Poisson diffusion process for the forward process, enabling a flexible and fine-grained noising paradigm, and employs a time predictor for the reverse process to adaptively modulate the denoising progress based on token semantics. Furthermore, NeoDiff utilizes an optimized schedule for inference to ensure more precise noise control and improved performance. Our approach unifies the theories of discrete and continuous diffusion models, offering a more principled and effective framework for text generation. Experimental results on several text generation tasks demonstrate NeoDiff's superior performance compared to baselines of non-autoregressive continuous and discrete diffusion models, iterative-based methods and autoregressive diffusion-based methods. These results highlight NeoDiff's potential as a powerful tool for generating high-quality text and advancing the field of diffusion-based text generation",

    "title": "A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LMs Matches Large LMs in Data Synthesis",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "While data synthesis and distillation are promising strategies to enhance small language models, current approaches heavily rely on Large Language Models (LLMs), which suffer from high computational costs, environmental inefficiency, and potential biases inherited from monolithic architectures. In contrast, smaller LMs are more accessible and sustainable, but their individual capabilities often fall short in generating high-quality, diverse, and reliable data. Inspired by collaborative human processes (e.g., peer review), we propose a multiple small LMs involved framework, GRA, that aggregates specialized roles across small LMs to iterative refinement and quality control typically achieved by a single large LM. In this collaborative framework, multiple small LMs assume distinct roles—Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator—to simulate a peer-review-inspired data synthesis pipeline. The Generator proposes initial data samples, the Reviewer critiques their quality and diversity, and the Adjudicator resolves conflicts to finalize the output. By decomposing the synthesis process into specialized sub-tasks, collaborative small LMs can achieve data-level parity with distillation from large LMs. Through experiments across multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LM outputs, e.g., Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct. Our results challenge the necessity of monolithic large models for high-quality data synthesis, advocating instead for strategic coordination of smaller agents",

However, it has also given rise to trust issues regarding model consistency between users and third-party service providers. Specifically, service providers can effortlessly degrade a model's parameter scale or precision for more margin profits, and although users may perceptibly experience differences in text quality, they often lack a reliable method for concrete monitoring. To address this problem, we propose a paradigm for model consistency monitoring on the user side. It constructs metrics based on the logits produced by LLMs to differentiate sequences generated by degraded models. Furthermore, by leveraging model offloading techniques, we demonstrate that the proposed method is implementable on consumer-grade devices. Metric evaluations conducted on three widely used LLMs series (OPT, Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5) along with system prototype efficiency tests on a consumer device (RTX 3080 TI) confirm both the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in various tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries manipulate prompts to generate harmful outputs. Examining jailbreak prompts helps uncover the shortcomings of LLMs. However, current jailbreak methods and the target model's defenses are engaged in an independent and adversarial process, resulting in the need for frequent attack iterations and redesigning attacks for different models. To address these gaps, we propose a Reverse Embedded Defense Attack (REDA) mechanism that disguises the attack intention as the \"defense\". intention against harmful content. Specifically, REDA starts from the target response, guiding the model to embed harmful content within its defensive measures, thereby relegating harmful content to a secondary role and making the model believe it is performing a defensive task. The attacking model considers that it is guiding the target model to deal with harmful content, while the target model thinks it is performing a defensive task, creating an illusion of cooperation between the two. Additionally, to enhance the model's confidence and guidance in \"defensive\" intentions, we adopt in-context learning (ICL) with a small number of attack examples and construct a corresponding dataset of attack examples. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the REDA method enables cross-model attacks without the need to redesign attack strategies for different models, enables successful jailbreak in one iteration, and outperforms existing methods on both open-source and closed-source models",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "This work investigates sentence-level models (i.e., models that operate at the sentence-level) to study how sentence representations from various encoders influence downstream task performance, and which syntactic, semantic, and discourse-level properties are essential for strong performance. Our experiments encompass encoders with diverse training regimes and pretraining domains, as well as various pooling strategies applied to multi-sentence input tasks (including sentence ordering, sentiment classification, and natural language inference) requiring coarse-to-fine-grained reasoning. We find that \"less mature\" representations (e.g., mean-pooled representations from BERT's first or last layer, or representations from encoders with limited fine-tuning) exhibit greater generalizability and adaptability to downstream tasks compared to representations from extensively fine-tuned models (e.g., SBERT or SimCSE). These findings are consistent across different pretraining seed initializations for BERT. Our probing analysis reveals that syntactic and discourse-level properties are stronger indicators of downstream performance than MTEB scores or decodability. Furthermore, the data and time efficiency of sentence-level models, often outperforming token-level models, underscores their potential for future research",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have yielded impressive successes on many language tasks. However, efficient processing of long contexts using LLMs remains a significant challenge. We introduce **EpMAN** – a method for processing long contexts in an episodic memory module while holistically attending to semantically-relevant context chunks. Output from episodic attention is then used to reweigh the decoder's self-attention to the stored KV cache of the context during training and generation. When an LLM decoder is trained using **EpMAN**, its performance on multiple challenging single-hop long-context recall and question-answering benchmarks is found to be stronger and more robust across the range from 16k to 256k tokens than baseline decoders trained with self-attention, and popular retrieval-augmented generation frameworks",

UoRA achieves state-of-the-art efficiency by leveraging a low-rank approximation method that reduces the number of trainable parameters without compromising performance. Unlike existing methods such as LoRA and VeRA, UoRA employs a re-parametrization mechanism that eliminates the need to adapt frozen projection matrices while maintaining shared projection layers across the model. This results in halving the trainable parameters compared to LoRA and outperforming VeRA in computation and storage efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate UoRA's superiority in achieving competitive fine-tuning performance with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate its performance on GLUE and E2E benchmarks and is effectiveness in instruction-tuning large language models and image classification models.

    "abstract": "LLMs have achieved remarkable fluency and coherence in text generation, yet their widespread adoption has raised concerns about content reliability and accountability. In high-stakes domains, it is crucial to understand where and how the content is created. To address this, we introduce the Text pROVEnance (TROVE) challenge, designed to trace each sentence of a target text back to specific source sentences within potentially lengthy or multi-document inputs. Beyond identifying sources, TROVE annotates the fine-grained relationships (quotation, compression, inference, and others), providing a deep understanding of how each target sentence is formed.To benchmark TROVE, we construct our dataset by leveraging three public datasets covering 11 diverse scenarios (e.g., QA and summarization) in English and Chinese, spanning source texts of varying lengths (0–5k, 5–10k, 10k+), emphasizing the multi-document and long-document settings essential for provenance. To ensure high-quality data, we employ a three-stage annotation process: sentence retrieval, GPT-4o provenance, and human provenance. We evaluate 11 LLMs under direct prompting and retrieval-augmented paradigms, revealing that retrieval is essential for robust performance, larger models perform better in complex relationship classification, and closed-source models often lead, yet open-source models show significant promise, particularly with retrieval augmentation.

    "abstract": "Despite rising global usage of large language models (LLMs), their ability to generate *long-form* answers to *culturally specific* questions remains unexplored in many languages. To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of **51.7K** culturally specific questions across **23** different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like \"Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?\" (Kirundi; English translation: \"Why was the first king of Burundi called Ntare (Lion)?\"). We evaluate factuality, relevance and surface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for many languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g., answering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource languages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more factual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions – questions that have consistent meaning and answer across many cultures.

Recent approaches suffer from insufficient and repetitive knowledge retrieval, tedious and time-consuming query parsing, and monotonous knowledge utilization. To this end, we develop a Hypothesis Knowledge Graph Enhanced (HyKGE) framework, which leverages LLMs' powerful reasoning capacity to compensate for the incompleteness of user queries, optimizes the interaction process with LLMs, and provides diverse retrieved knowledge. Specifically, HyKGE explores the zero-shot capability and the rich knowledge of LLMs with Hypothesis Outputs to extend feasible exploration directions in the KGs, as well as the carefully curated prompt to enhance the density and efficiency of LLMs' responses. Furthermore, we introduce the HO Fragment Granularity-aware Rerank Module to filter out noise while ensuring the balance between diversity and relevance in retrieved knowledge. Experiments on two Chinese medical multiple-choice question datasets and one Chinese open-domain medical Q&A dataset with two LLM turbos demonstrate the superiority of HyKGE in terms of accuracy and explainability.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges in handling long-context tasks because of their limited effective context window size during pretraining, which restricts their ability to generalize over extended sequences. Meanwhile, extending the context window in LLMs through post-pretraining is highly resource-intensive.To address this, we introduce LongRecipe, an efficient training strategy for extending the context window of LLMs, including impactful token analysis, position index transformation, and training optimization strategies. It simulates long-sequence inputs while maintaining training efficiency and significantly improves the model's understanding of long-range dependencies. Experiments on three types of LLMs show that LongRecipe can utilize long sequences while requiring only 30% of the target context window size, and reduces computational training resource over 85% compared to full sequence training. Furthermore, LongRecipe also preserves the original LLM's capabilities in general tasks. Ultimately, we can extend effective context window of open-source LLMs from 8k to 128k, achieving performance close to GPT-4 with just one day of dedicated training using a single GPU with 80G memory.Our code is released at https://github.com/zhiyuanhubj/LongRecipe",

The results reveal that different ranks within the LoRA modules not only exhibit varying levels of importance but also evolve dynamically throughout the fine-tuning process, which may limit the performance of LoRA. Based on these findings, we propose BeamLoRA, which conceptualizes each LoRA module as a beam where each rank naturally corresponds to a potential sub-solution, and the fine-tuning process becomes a search for the optimal sub-solution combination. BeamLoRA dynamically eliminates underperforming sub-solutions while expanding the parameter space for promising ones, enhancing performance with a fixed rank.

However, current role-playing training has two significant issues: (I) Using a predefined role profile to prompt dialogue training for specific scenarios usually leads to biases and even conflicts between the dialogue and the profile, resulting in training biases. (II) Models learn to imitate the role based solely on the profile, neglecting profile-dialogue alignment at the sentence level. To overcome the aforementioned hurdles, we propose a novel framework **Beyond Dialogue**, which introduces \"beyond dialogue\" tasks to align dialogue with profile traits for each scenario, eliminating biases during training. Furthermore, the framework achieves a sentence-level fine-grained alignment between profile and dialogue through an innovative prompting mechanism that generates reasoning data for training. Moreover, the aforementioned methods are fully automated and low-cost.

In this paper, we address this challenge by leveraging automated large-scale test-case synthesis to enhance code model training. Specifically, we design a pipeline that generates extensive (question, test-cases) pairs from existing code data. Using these test cases, we construct preference pairs based on pass rates over sampled programs to train reward models with Bradley-Terry loss. It shows an average of 10-point improvement for Llama-3.1-8B-Ins and 5-point improvement for Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Ins through best-of-32 sampling, making the 7B model on par with 236B DeepSeek-V2.5. Furthermore, we conduct reinforcement learning with both reward models and test-case pass rewards, leading to consistent improvements across HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench (V4). Notably, we follow the R1-style training to start from Qwen2.5-Coder-base directly and show that our RL training can improve model on HumanEval-plus by over 25% and MBPP-plus by 6% for merely 80 optimization steps.

We formalize \"semantics\" as the meaningful information abstracted from a sequence of tokens and quantify this by comparing the entropy reduction observed for a sequence of tokens (macro-level) and individual tokens (micro-level). To achieve this, we design a lightweight estimator to compute the mutual information at each transformer layer, which is agnostic to different tasks and language model architectures. We apply IE in both synthetic in-context learning (ICL) scenarios and natural sentence contexts. Experiments demonstrate informativeness and patterns about semantics.

    "title": "DebateCoder: Towards Collective Intelligence of LLMs via Test Case Driven LLM Debate for Code Generation",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "With the impressive reasoning and text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs), methods leveraging multiple LLMs to debate each other have garnered increasing attention. However, existing debate-based approaches remain limited in effectiveness in structured and detailed domains represented by code generation due to several reasons: 1) Reliance on different instances of the same LLM for debate, neglecting the potential benefits of integrating diverse models with varied internal knowledge for more comprehensive code generation, 2) under-utilization of test cases, and 3) reliance on third-party LLM moderators for result consolidation and decision-making, probably introducing hallucinations and judgment errors. To address these challenges, we propose DebateCoder to collect intelligence of LLMs via test case-driven debate for code generation. In DebateCoder, test cases serve as a medium for models to analyze code and identify bugs, while opposing models generate test cases to challenge each other's code during the debate process. These test cases, along with their execution results, are elaborately leveraged to refine and enhance the code through a novel contrastive analysis process. Furthermore, DebateCoder leverages test case outcomes to assess code quality and determine convergence criteria. Unlike previous approaches, DebateCoder emphasizes the collaborative improvement of both models through competitive debate and interactive analysis. Abundant experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DebateCoder",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to Suppress the Privacy and faIrness coupled Neurons (SPIN), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, e.g., improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2% and privacy awareness by 14.0%.More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. Furthermore, we show that SPIN could generalize to other potential trade-off dimensions.We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems.

    "abstract": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in processing graphs, they struggle with comprehending graphical structure information through prompts of graph description sequences, especially as the graph size increases. We attribute this challenge to the uneven memory performance of LLMs across different positions in graph description sequences, known as \"Positional bias\". To address this, we propose GraphInsight, a novel framework aimed at improving LLMs' comprehension of both macro- and micro-level graphical information. GraphInsight is grounded in two key strategies: 1) placing critical graphical information in positions where LLMs exhibit stronger memory performance, and 2) investigating a lightweight external knowledge base for regions with weaker memory performance, inspired by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Moreover, GraphInsight explores integrating these two strategies into LLM agent processes for composite graph tasks that require multi-step reasoning. Extensive empirical studies on benchmarks with a wide range of evaluation tasks show that GraphInsight significantly outperforms all other graph description methods (e.g., prompting techniques and reordering strategies) in understanding graph structures of varying sizes",

It first dynamically generates targeted personas tailored to an input argument, then simulates each persona's reasoning process to evaluate the argument quality from multiple perspectives. To effectively generate fine-grained quality scores, we develop a coarse-to-fine scoring strategy that first generates a coarse-grained integer score and then refines it into a fine-grained decimal score.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become the de facto method to elicit reasoning capabilities from large language models (LLMs). However, to mitigate hallucinations in CoT that are notoriously difficult to detect, current methods such as process reward models (PRMs) or self-consistency operate as opaque boxes and do not provide checkable evidence for their judgments, possibly limiting their effectiveness. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the idea that \"the gold standard for supporting a mathematical claim is to provide a proof\". We propose a retrospective, step-aware formal verification framework Safe. Rather than assigning arbitrary scores, we strive to articulate mathematical claims in formal mathematical language Lean 4 at each reasoning step and provide formal proofs to identify hallucinations. We evaluate our framework Safe across multiple language models and various mathematical datasets, demonstrating a significant performance improvement while offering interpretable and verifiable evidence. We also propose FormalStep as a benchmark for step correctness theorem proving with 30,809 formal statements. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first endeavor to utilize formal mathematical language Lean 4 for verifying content generated by LLMs, aligning with the reason why formal mathematical languages were created in the first place: to provide a robust foundation for hallucination-prone human-written proofs",

This paper presents a novel retrieval-based speculative decoding method that adapts the suffix automaton (SAM) for efficient and accurate draft generation by utilizing the generating text sequence and static text corpus. Unlike existing n-gram matching methods, SAM-Decoding finds the exact longest suffix match, achieving an average time complexity of O(1) per generation step of SAM update and suffix retrieval.It can also integrate with existing methods, adaptively selecting a draft generation strategy based on match length to generalize to broader domains. Extensive experiments on Spec-Bench show that our method is 18% faster than other retrieval-based SD methods. Additionally, when combined with advanced EAGLE-2, it provides an additional speedup of 3.28% – 11.13% across various-sized LLM backbones",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize smart home assistants by enhancing their ability to accurately understand user needs and respond appropriately, which is extremely beneficial for building a smarter home environment. While recent studies have explored integrating LLMs into smart home systems, they primarily focus on handling straightforward, valid single-device operation instructions. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex and often involve users issuing invalid instructions or controlling multiple devices simultaneously. These have two main challenges: LLMs must accurately identify and rectify errors in user instructions and execute multiple user instructions perfectly. To address these challenges and advance the development of LLM-based smart home assistants, we introduce HomeBench, the first smart home dataset with valid and invalid instructions across single and multiple devices in this paper. We have experimental results on 13 distinct LLMs; e.g., GPT-4o achieves only a 0.0% success rate in the scenario of invalid multi-device instructions, revealing that the existing state-of-the-art LLMs still cannot perform well in this situation even with the help of in-context learning, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning.

We introduce a new dataset, named the Intelligibility Preference Speech Dataset (INTP), and extend the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) framework to accommodate diverse TTS architectures. After INTP alignment, in addition to intelligibility, we observe overall improvements including naturalness, similarity, and audio quality for multiple TTS models across diverse domains. Based on that, we also verify the weak-to-strong generalization ability of INTP for more intelligible models such as CosyVoice 2 and Ints. Moreover, we showcase the potential for further improvements through iterative alignment based on Ints. Audio samples are available at https://intalign.github.io/",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data is a prevalent practice in code generation. A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models has raised significant concerns regarding their potential misuse by malicious actors. As a result, developing effective detectors to mitigate these risks has become a critical priority. However, most existing detection methods focus excessively on detection accuracy, often neglecting the societal risks posed by high false positive rates (FPRs). This paper addresses this issue by leveraging Conformal Prediction (CP), which effectively constrains the upper bound of FPRs. While directly applying CP constrains FPRs, it also leads to a significant reduction in detection performance. To overcome this trade-off, this paper proposes a Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection Framework via Multiscaled Conformal Prediction (MCP), which both enforces the FPR constraint and improves detection performance. This paper also introduces RealDet, a high-quality dataset that spans a wide range of domains, ensuring realistic calibration and enabling superior detection performance when combined with MCP. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MCP effectively constrains FPRs, significantly enhances detection performance, and increases robustness against adversarial attacks across multiple detectors and datasets",

    "abstract": "In knowledge graph embedding, leveraging relation specific entity transformation has markedly enhanced performance. However, the consistency of embedding differences before and after transformation remains unaddressed, risking the loss of valuable inductive bias inherent in the embeddings. This inconsistency stems from two problems. First, transformation representations are specified for relations in a disconnected manner, allowing dissimilar transformations and corresponding entity embeddings for similar relations. Second, a generalized plug-in approach as a SFBR (Semantic Filter Based on Relations) disrupts this consistency through excessive concentration of entity embeddings under entity-based regularization, generating indistinguishable score distributions among relations. In this paper, we introduce a plug-in KGE method, Relation-Semantics Consistent Filter (RSCF). Its entity transformation has three features for enhancing semantic consistency: 1) shared affine transformation of relation embeddings across all relations, 2) rooted entity transformation that adds an entity embedding to its change represented by the transformed vector, and 3) normalization of the change to prevent scale reduction. To amplify the advantages of consistency that preserve semantics on embeddings, RSCF adds relation transformation and prediction modules for enhancing the semantics. In knowledge graph completion tasks with distance-based and tensor decomposition models, RSCF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods, showing robustness across all relations and their frequencies",

To bridge this gap, we propose RolePlot, a role-playing framework specifically designed to evaluate and enhance the plot-progression capabilities of RPAs. RolePlot begins by constructing a plot-progression dataset extended from human-written literary scripts and specially designed synthetic data, followed by narrative theory-driven manual annotation and automated labeling validated through human verification. We then exploit the over-parameterized embedding space of LLMs to detect a \"trigger subspace\" that identifies dialogue segments catalyzing plot transitions. When user's inputs align with this subspace, we explicitly prompt RPAs to advance the plot. For evaluation, we simulate User-RPA interactions and track both the conversation longevity (measured in dialogue turns before disengagement) and users' arousal levels across different stages. Empirically, our method improves RPAs' capability to time plot developments, and more importantly, yielding a significant increase in conversation turns and sustained higher arousal levels, thereby confirming that users experience more immersive engagements",

Our approach includes intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for separate reward model training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model, which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking.

However, current approaches face a critical dilemma: TOD systems are often trained on a limited set of target APIs, requiring new data to maintain their quality when interfacing with new services, while LAs are not trained to maintain user intent over multi-turn conversations. Because both robust multi-turn management and advanced function calling are crucial for effective conversational agents, we evaluate these skills on three popular benchmarks: MultiWOZ 2.4 (TOD), BFCL V3 (LA), and API-Bank (LA)—and our analyses reveal that specialized approaches excel in one domain but underperform in the other. To bridge this chasm, we introduce **CoALM** (**C**onversational **A**gentic **L**anguage **M**odel), a unified approach that integrates both conversational and agentic capabilities.

To address these challenges, we introduce M4Doc, a novel single-to-mix Modality alignment framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). M4Doc aligns an imageonly encoder with the multimodal representations of an MLLM, pre-trained on large-scale document image datasets. This alignment enables a lightweight DIMT model to learn crucial visual-textual correlations during training. During inference, M4Doc bypasses the MLLM, maintaining computational efficiency while benefiting from its multimodal knowledge.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Social agents powered by large language models (LLMs) can simulate human social behaviors but fall short in handling complex social dialogues. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has proven effective in aligning LLM behavior with human preferences across various agent tasks. However, standard DPO focuses solely on individual turns, which limits its effectiveness in multi-turn social interactions. Several DPO-based multi-turn alignment methods with session-level data have shown potential in addressing this problem. While these methods consider multiple turns across entire sessions, they are often overly coarse-grained, introducing training noise, and lack robust theoretical support. To resolve these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which dynamically select key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior. SDPO minimizes training noise and is grounded in a rigorous theoretical framework. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.

    "abstract": "Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues.

To close these gaps, we introduce SURVEYFORGE, which first generates the outline by analyzing the logical structure of human-written outlines and referring to the retrieved domain-related articles. Subsequently, leveraging high-quality papers retrieved from memory by our scholar navigation agent, SURVEYFORGE can automatically generate and refine the content of the generated article. Moreover, to achieve a comprehensive evaluation, we construct SurveyBench, which includes 100 human-written survey papers for win-rate comparison and assesses AI-generated survey papers across three dimensions: reference, outline, and content quality.

Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task.

In this paper, we focus on redundancy from three key perspectives: 1) Redundancy of benchmark capability dimensions, 2) Redundancy in the number of test questions, and 3) Cross-benchmark redundancy within specific domains. Through the comprehensive analysis over hundreds of MLLMs' performance across more than 20 benchmarks, we aim to quantitatively measure the level of redundancy lies in existing MLLM evaluations, provide valuable insights to guide the future development of MLLM benchmarks, and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy issues effectively",

Therefore, we introduce WavRAG, the first retrieval augmented generation framework with native, end-to-end audio support. WavRAG offers two key features: 1) Bypassing ASR, WavRAG directly processes raw audio for both embedding and retrieval. 2) WavRAG integrates audio and text into a unified knowledge representation. Specifically, we propose the WavRetriever to facilitate the retrieval from a text-audio hybrid knowledge base, and further enhance the in-context capabilities of spoken dialogue models through the integration of chain-of-thought reasoning. In comparison to state-of-the-art ASR-Text RAG pipelines, WavRAG achieves comparable retrieval performance while delivering a 10x acceleration. Furthermore, WavRAG's unique text-audio hybrid retrieval capability extends the boundaries of RAG to the audio modality",

However, developing robust ASR models for young children's speech remains challenging due to differences in pronunciation, tone, and pace compared to adult speech. In this paper, we introduce a new Mandarin speech dataset focused on children aged 3 to 5, addressing the scarcity of resources in this area. The dataset comprises 41.25 hours of speech with carefully crafted manual transcriptions, collected from 397 speakers across various provinces in China, with balanced gender representation. We provide a comprehensive analysis of speaker demographics, speech duration distribution and geographic coverage. Additionally, we evaluate ASR performance on models trained from scratch, such as Conformer, as well as fine-tuned pre-trained models like HuBERT and Whisper, where fine-tuning demonstrates significant performance improvements. Furthermore, we assess speaker verification (SV) on our dataset, showing that, despite the challenges posed by the unique vocal characteristics of young children, the dataset effectively supports both ASR and SV tasks. This dataset is a valuable contribution to Mandarin child speech research and holds potential for applications in educational technology and child-computer interaction.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) further enhances this process by constructing preference pairs of chosen and rejected responses. In this work, we aim to scale up the number of on-policy samples via repeated random sampling to improve alignment performance. Conventional practice selects the sample with the highest reward as chosen and the lowest as rejected for DPO. However, our experiments reveal that this strategy leads to a decline in performance as the sample size increases. To address this, we investigate preference data construction through the lens of underlying normal distribution of sample rewards. We categorize the reward space into seven representative points and systematically explore all 21 (C72) pairwise combinations. Through evaluations on four models using AlpacaEval 2, we find that selecting the rejected response at reward position 𝜇 - 2𝜎 rather than the minimum reward, is crucial for optimal performance.

Existing methods are based on the assumption that different nodes exhibit varying degrees of influence on predictions. They define nodes with high predictive influence as important nodes and target them for attacks. If the model treats nodes' predictive influence more uniformly, attackers will find it harder to target high predictive influence nodes. In this paper, we propose Similarizing the predictive Influence of Nodes with Contrastive Learning (SINCon), a defense mechanism that encourages the model to learn graph representations where nodes with varying importance have a more uniform influence on predictions. Extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets demonstrate that SINCon not only preserves high classification accuracy on clean data but also significantly enhances resistance against LLM-driven message injection attacks",

While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce **Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP)**, a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation, rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency, (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification, and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (versus 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment",

Specifically, we propose KnowSelf, a data-centric approach that applies agents with knowledgeable self-awareness like humans. Concretely, we devise a heuristic situation judgement criterion to mark special tokens on the agent's self-explored trajectories for collecting training data. Through a two-stage training process, the agent model can switch between different situations by generating specific special tokens, achieving optimal planning effects with minimal costs.

    "abstract": "The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContests, using GPT-4o as the backbone.

    "title": "Can Knowledge Graphs Make Large Language Models More Trustworthy? An Empirical Study Over Open-ended Question Answering",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent works integrating Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have shown promising improvements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on closed-ended tasks, leaving a gap in evaluating performance on more complex, real-world scenarios. This limitation also hinders a thorough assessment of KGs' potential to reduce hallucinations in LLMs. To address this, we introduce OKGQA, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs augmented with KGs in open-ended, real-world question answering settings. OKGQA reflects practical complexities through diverse question types and incorporates metrics to quantify both hallucination rates and reasoning improvements in LLM+KG models. To consider the scenarios in which KGs may contain varying levels of errors, we propose a benchmark variant, OKGQA-P, to assess model performance when the semantics and structure of KGs are deliberately perturbed and contaminated. In this paper, we aims to (1) explore whether KGs can make LLMs more trustworthy in an open-ended setting, and (2) conduct a comparative analysis to shed light on method design. We believe this study can facilitate a more complete performance comparison and encourages continuous improvement in integrating KGs with LLMs to mitigate hallucination, and make LLMs more trustworthy",

    "title": "Nudging: Inference-time Alignment of LLMs via Guided Decoding",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7×-14× smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment.

    "title": "Unveiling Attractor Cycles in Large Language Models: A Dynamical Systems View of Successive Paraphrasing",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing iterative processes and evolution over time. Within such systems, repetitive transformations can lead to stable configurations, known as attractors, including fixed points and limit cycles. Applying this perspective to large language models (LLMs), which iteratively map input text to output text, provides a principled approach to characterizing long-term behaviors. Successive paraphrasing serves as a compelling testbed for exploring such dynamics, as paraphrases re-express the same underlying meaning with linguistic variation. Although LLMs are expected to explore a diverse set of paraphrases in the text space, our study reveals that successive paraphrasing converges to stable periodic states, such as 2-period attractor cycles, limiting linguistic diversity. This phenomenon is attributed to the self-reinforcing nature of LLMs, as they iteratively favour and amplify certain textual forms over others. This pattern persists with increasing generation randomness or alternating prompts and LLMs. These findings underscore inherent constraints in LLM generative capability, while offering a novel dynamical systems perspective for studying their expressive potential",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent studies emphasize that manually ensuring a consistent response style and maintaining high data quality in training sets can significantly improve the performance of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) while reducing the number of training examples needed. However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic elements in responses: linguistic form and instructional surprisal. We find that, among training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response elements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, using 0.7% of the full dataset in certain cases, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding and open-ended question-answering benchmarks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with one or more fine-tuning phases have become necessary to unlock various capabilities, enabling LLMs to follow natural language instructions and align with human preferences. However, it carries the risk of catastrophic forgetting during sequential training, the parametric knowledge or the ability learned in previous stages may be overwhelmed by incoming training data. This paper finds that LLMs can restore some original knowledge by regularly resetting partial parameters. Inspired by this, we introduce Half Fine-Tuning (HFT) for LLMs, as a substitute for full fine-tuning (FFT), to mitigate the forgetting issues, where half of the parameters are selected to learn new tasks. In contrast, the other half are frozen to retain previous knowledge. We provide a feasibility analysis from the optimization perspective and interpret the parameter selection operation as a regularization term. HFT could be seamlessly integrated into existing fine-tuning frameworks without changing the model architecture. Extensive experiments and analysis on supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and continual learning consistently demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of HFT. Compared with FFT, HFT not only significantly alleviates the forgetting problem, but also achieves the best performance in a series of downstream benchmarks, with an approximately 30% reduction in training time",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Commonsense question answering (QA) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense abilities of large language models. However, answering commonsense questions correctly requires not only knowledge but also reasoning—even for seemingly simple questions. We demonstrate that such hidden reasoning attributes in commonsense questions can lead evaluation accuracy differences of up to 24.8% across different difficulty levels in the same benchmark. Current benchmarks overlook these hidden reasoning attributes, making it difficult to assess a model's specific levels of commonsense knowledge and reasoning ability. To address this issue, we introduce ReComSBench, a novel framework that reveals hidden reasoning attributes behind commonsense questions by leveraging the knowledge generated during the reasoning process. Additionally, ReComSBench proposes three new metrics for decoupled evaluation: Knowledge Balanced Accuracy, Marginal Sampling Gain, and Knowledge Coverage Ratio. Experiments show that ReComSBench provides insights into model performance that traditional benchmarks cannot offer. The difficulty stratification based on revealed hidden reasoning attributes performs as effectively as the model-probability-based approach but is more generalizable and better suited for improving a model's commonsense reasoning abilities. By uncovering and analyzing the hidden reasoning attributes in commonsense data, ReComSBench offers a new approach to enhancing existing commonsense benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology. Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex, multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational mathematical question generation, following a \"plan-evaluate-optimize\" approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge. However, LLMs still encounter challenges in effectively utilizing the knowledge from retrieved documents, often being misled by irrelevant or noisy information. To address this issue, we introduce RankCoT, a knowledge refinement method that incorporates reranking signals in generating CoT-based summarization for knowledge refinement based on given query and all retrieval documents. During training, RankCoT prompts the LLM to generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) candidates based on the query and individual documents. It then fine-tunes the LLM to directly reproduce the best CoT from these candidate outputs based on all retrieved documents, which requires LLM to filter out irrelevant documents during generating CoT-style summarization. Additionally, RankCoT incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that further refines the CoT outputs, resulting in higher-quality training data. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RankCoT, showing its superior performance over other knowledge refinement models. Further analysis reveals that RankCoT can provide shorter but effective refinement results, enabling the generator to produce more accurate answers.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigate its roots during supervised training. We introduce methods to mitigate these biases, including polishing golden references and filtering unnatural training instances. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these approaches significantly reduce translationese while improving translation naturalness, validated by human evaluations and automatic metrics.

While KV Cache can significantly reduce recomputation during inference, it also introduces additional memory overhead. KV Cache quantization presents a promising solution, striking a good balance between memory usage and accuracy. Previous research has shown that the Keys are distributed by channel, while the Values are distributed by token. Consequently, the common practice is to apply channel-wise quantization to the Keys and token-wise quantization to the Values. However, our further investigation reveals that a small subset of unusual tokens exhibit unique characteristics that deviate from this pattern, which can substantially impact quantization accuracy. To address this, we develop a simple yet effective method to identify these tokens accurately during the decoding process and exclude them from quantization as outlier tokens, significantly improving overall accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant accuracy improvements under 2-bit quantization and can deliver a 6.4 times reduction in memory usage and a 2.3 times increase in throughput",

Our investigation reveals that hallucinated content manifests as distinct, identifiable patterns in the model's hidden state space. Motivated by this finding, we propose Activation Steering Decoding (ASD), a training-free approach that mitigates hallucination through targeted intervention in the model's intermediate activations. ASD operates by first identifying directional patterns of hallucination in the activation space using a small calibration set, then employing a contrast decoding mechanism that computes the difference between positive and negative steering predictions. This approach effectively suppresses hallucination patterns while preserving the model's general capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination across multiple benchmarks while maintaining performance on general visual understanding tasks.

Specifically, we first point out that intermediate checkpoints during instruction tuning of the dense model are naturally suitable for specialized experts, and then propose an expert expansion stage to flexibly achieve models with flexible numbers of experts, where genetic algorithm and parameter merging are introduced to ensure sufficient diversity of new extended experts. To ensure that each specialized expert in the MoE model works as expected, we select a small amount of seed data that each expert excels to pre-optimize the router.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on historical observations as spatio-temporal contexts for decision making, leading to significant storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce MapNav, a novel end-to-end VLN model that leverages Annotated Semantic Map (ASM) to replace historical frames. Specifically, our approach constructs a top-down semantic map at the start of each episode and update it at each timestep, allowing for precise object mapping and structured navigation information. Then, we enhance this map with explicit textual labels for key regions, transforming abstract semantics into clear navigation cues and generate our ASM. MapNav agent using the constructed ASM as input, and use the powerful end-to-end capabilities of VLM to empower VLN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MapNav achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both simulated and real-world environments, validating the effectiveness of our method. We will release our ASM generation source code and dataset to ensure reproducibility, contributing valuable resources to the field. We believe that our proposed MapNav can be used as a new memory representation method in VLN, paving the way for future research in this field",

    "title": "Exploring Compositional Generalization of Multimodal LLMs for Medical Imaging",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Medical imaging provides essential visual insights for diagnosis, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly utilized for its analysis due to their strong generalization capabilities; however, the underlying factors driving this generalization remain unclear. Current research suggests that multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks. To analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ **compositional generalization** (CG), which refers to the models' ability to understand novel combinations by recombining learned elements, as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely defined by **M**odality, **A**natomical area, and **T**ask, naturally providing an environment for exploring CG, we assembled 106 medical datasets to create **Med-MAT** for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training. Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports datasets with limited data and confirmed that MLLMs can achieve CG across classification and detection tasks, underscoring its broader generalization potential.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal abilities but remain prone to multilingual object hallucination, with a higher likelihood of generating responses inconsistent with the visual input when utilizing queries in non-English languages compared to English. Most existing approaches to address these rely on pretraining or fine-tuning, which are resource-intensive. In this paper, inspired by observing the disparities in cross-modal attention patterns across languages, we propose Cross-Lingual Attention Intervention for Mitigating multilingual object hallucination (CLAIM) in LVLMs, a novel near training-free method by aligning attention patterns. CLAIM first identifies language-specific cross-modal attention heads, then estimates language shift vectors from English to the target language, and finally intervenes in the attention outputs during inference to facilitate cross-lingual visual perception capability alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLAIM achieves an average improvement of 13.56% (up to 30% in Spanish) on the POPE and 21.75% on the hallucination subsets of the MME benchmark across various languages. Further analysis reveals that multilingual attention divergence is most prominent in intermediate layers, highlighting their critical role in multilingual scenarios",

Prior human-annotated CPS datasets are extremely small in size and lack integration with real-world product search systems. We propose a novel approach, TRACER, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate realistic and natural conversations for different shopping domains.

However, most previous existing methods mainly view each programming language in isolation and ignore the knowledge transfer among different programming languages. To bridge the gap among different programming languages, we introduce a novel multi-agent collaboration framework to enhance multilingual instruction tuning for code LLMs, where multiple language-specific intelligent agent components with generation memory work together to transfer knowledge from one language to another efficiently and effectively. Specifically, we first generate the language-specific instruction data from the code snippets and then provide the generated data as the seed data for language-specific agents. Multiple language-specific agents discuss and collaborate to formulate a new instruction and its corresponding solution (A new programming language or existing programming language), To further encourage the cross-lingual transfer, each agent stores its generation history as memory and then summarizes its merits and faults. Finally, the high-quality multilingual instruction data is used to encourage knowledge transfer among different programming languages to train Qwen2.5-xCoder.

Recent efforts leverage Vision Language Models (VLMs) as direct controllers, frequently pausing the game to analyze screens and plan action through language reasoning. However, this inefficient paradigm fundamentally restricts agents to basic and non-fluent interactions: relying on isolated VLM reasoning for each action makes it impossible to handle tasks requiring high reactivity (e.g., FPS shooting) or dynamic adaptability (e.g., ACT combat). To handle this, we propose a paradigm shift in gameplay agent design: instead of direct control, VLM serves as a developer, creating specialized execution modules tailored for tasks like shooting and combat. These modules handle real-time game interactions, elevating VLM to a high-level developer. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce GameSense, a gameplay agent framework where VLM develops task-specific game sense modules by observing task execution and leveraging vision tools and neural network training pipelines. These modules encapsulate action-feedback logic, ranging from direct action rules to neural network-based decisions. Experiments demonstrate that our framework is the first to achieve fluent gameplay in diverse genres, including ACT, FPS, and Flappy Bird, setting a new benchmark for game-playing agents",

However, current post-training techniques rely heavily on supervisory signals, such as outcome supervision or auxiliary reward models, which face the problem of scalability and high annotation costs. This motivates us to enhance LLM reasoning without the need for external supervision. Given the input query, the LLM seeks the globally optimal response by stepwise sampling and self-rewarding, and optimizes itself with the collected responses. Genius offers some technical solutions to address the following key challenges. To tackle the problem of how to determine the steps in the response via self-rewarding, Genius introduces a stepwise foresight re-sampling strategy to sample and estimate the step value by simulating future outcomes. Recognizing the intrinsic noise and uncertainty of self-supervision, we propose an advantage-calibrated optimization (ACO) loss function to mitigate estimation inconsistencies.

To bridge this gap, we study the setting of soft queries on uncertain knowledge, which is motivated by the establishment of soft constraint programming. We further propose an ML-based approach with both forward inference and backward calibration to answer soft queries on large-scale, incomplete, and uncertain knowledge graphs. Theoretical discussions reveal that our method ensures there are no catastrophic cascading errors in our forward inference algorithm while maintaining the same complexity as state-of-the-art inference algorithms for first-order queries.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) require continuous knowledge updates and the mitigation of hallucination issues in generated content, lifelong model editing has become a prominent research area. A mainstream knowledge editing method usually freezes LLM's original parameters and adds extra trainable modules for new knowledge management, reducing interference with old knowledge. Although these approaches have achieved some success, our experiments show that, after extensive editing, the model's knowledge understanding and memory capacity significantly degrade, particularly concerning early edited knowledge. The root cause is that subsequent edits interfere with the previously edited knowledge, and we refer to this phenomenon as knowledge coupling. To address this issue, we propose the Knowledge Decoupling Editing (KDE) method. Specifically, KDE stores the basis vectors of the representation space of past edits in a knowledge cache. It projects the gradient of the current edit onto a space orthogonal to previous knowledge for updating. This method effectively alleviates the coupling between different pieces of knowledge. We also propose a two-stage training strategy to better balance the model's ability to edit new knowledge and distinguish whether a query is related to previous edits. This strategy gradually reduces the interference between new knowledge editing and query distinction, maintaining stable performance during long-term editing. We compared KDE with nine cutting-edge editing methods across multiple mainstream LLMs. The results demonstrate that, regarding question-answering ability and hallucination mitigation, KDE achieves average improvements of 14% and 61%",

Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named 𝜙-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, 𝜙-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency.

We propose two categories of watermark removal approaches: pre-distillation removal through untargeted and targeted training data paraphrasing (UP and TP), and post-distillation removal through inference-time watermark neutralization (WN). Extensive experiments across multiple model pairs, watermarking schemes and hyper-parameter settings demonstrate that both TP and WN thoroughly eliminate inherited watermarks, with WN achieving this while maintaining knowledge transfer efficiency and low computational overhead.

The results highlight three key findings on how to construct a reliable benchmark: (i) it is important to minimize differences between chosen and rejected responses beyond correctness, (ii) evaluating reward models requires multiple comparisons across a wide range of chosen and rejected responses, and (iii) given that reward models encounter responses with diverse representations, responses should be sourced from a variety of models. However, we also observe that a extremely high correlation with degree of overoptimization leads to comparatively lower correlation with certain downstream performance.

Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs.

In multimodal scenarios, attention heads exhibit varying preferences for different modalities, resulting in significant disparities in modality importance across attention heads. Traditional KV cache eviction methods, which are tailored for unimodal settings, fail to capture modality-specific information, thereby yielding suboptimal performance. MadaKV addresses these challenges through two key components: modality preference adaptation and hierarchical compression compensation. By dynamically sensing modality information within attention heads and adaptively retaining critical tokens, MadaKV achieves substantial reductions in KV cache memory footprint and model inference decoding latency (1.3 to 1.5 times improvement) while maintaining high accuracy across various multimodal long-context tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MLLMs and the MileBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of MadaKV compared to existing KV cache eviction methods",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in question-answering (QA) tasks, particularly in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) scenarios and long-context applications. However, their performance is hindered by noisy reference documents, which often distract from essential information. Despite fine-tuning efforts, Transformer-based architectures struggle to prioritize relevant content. This is evidenced by their tendency to allocate disproportionate attention to irrelevant or later-positioned documents. Recent work proposes the differential attention mechanism to address this issue, but this mechanism is limited by an unsuitable common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and high computational costs. Inspired by the operational amplifier (OpAmp), we propose the OpAmp adaptation to address these challenges, which is implemented with adapters efficiently. By integrating the adapter into pre-trained Transformer blocks, our approach enhances focus on the golden context without costly training from scratch. Empirical evaluations on noisy-context benchmarks reveal that our Qwen2.5-OpAmp-72B model, trained with our OpAmp adaptation, surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o.Our code is available at https://github.com/wuhy68/OpampAdapter",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models have achieved significant success in generative tasks (e.g., speech cloning and audio generation) related to speech, audio, music, and other signal domains. A crucial element of these models is the discrete acoustic codecs, which serve as an intermediate representation replacing the mel-spectrogram. However, there exist several gaps between discrete codecs and downstream speech language models. Specifically, 1) Due to the reconstruction paradigm of the Codec model and the structure of residual vector quantization, the initial channel of the codebooks contains excessive information, making it challenging to directly generate acoustic tokens from weakly supervised signals such as text in downstream tasks. 2) Achieving good reconstruction performance requires the utilization of numerous codebooks, which increases the burden on downstream speech language models. Consequently, leveraging the characteristics of speech language models, we propose Language-Codec. In the Language-Codec, we introduce a Masked Channel Residual Vector Quantization (MCRVQ) mechanism along with improved fourier transform structures, refined discriminator design to address the aforementioned gaps. We compare our method with competing audio compression algorithms and observe significant outperformance across extensive evaluations. Furthermore, we also validate the efficiency of the Language-Codec on downstream speech language models. The source code and pretrained models will be open-sourced after the paper is accepted.

    "title": "Adaptive Tool Use in Large Language Models with Meta-Cognition Trigger",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable emergent capabilities, transforming the execution of functional tasks by leveraging external tools for complex problems that require specialized processing or up-to-date data. While existing research expands LLMs access to diverse tools (e.g., program interpreters, search engines, calculators), the necessity of using these tools is often overlooked, leading to indiscriminate tool invocation. This naive approach raises two key issues: increased latency due to unnecessary tool calls, and potential errors resulting from faulty interactions with external tools. In this paper, we introduce meta-cognition as a proxy for LLMs self-assessment of their capabilities, reflecting the model's awareness of its own limitations. Based on this, we propose MeCo, an adaptive decision-making strategy for external tool use. MeCo quantifies metacognitive scores by capturing high-level cognitive signals in the representation space, guiding when to invoke tools. Notably, MeCo is fine-tuning-free and incurs minimal cost. Experiments across multiple backbone models and benchmarks show that MeCo reliably detects LLMs' internal cognitive signals and significantly improves tool-use decision-making",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) are widely used to evaluate the commonsense, understanding, and problem-solving abilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the open-source nature of these benchmarks and the broad sources of training data for LLMs have inevitably led to benchmark contamination, resulting in unreliable evaluation. To alleviate this issue, we propose the contamination-free MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF, which reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both unintentional and malicious data contamination. To mitigate unintentional data contamination, we source questions from a broader domain of over 200 billion webpages and apply three specifically designed decontamination rules. To prevent malicious data contamination, we divide the benchmark into validation and test sets with similar difficulty and subject distributions. The test set remains closed-source to ensure reliable results, while the validation set is publicly available to promote transparency and facilitate independent evaluation. The performance gap between these two sets of LLMs will indicate the contamination degree on the validation set in the future. We evaluated over 40 mainstream LLMs on the MMLU-CF. Compared to the original MMLU, not only LLMs' performances significantly dropped but also the performance rankings of them changed considerably. This indicates the effectiveness of our approach in establishing a contamination-free and fairer evaluation standard",

In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize code-switching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand code-switching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating code-switching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs",

    "abstract": "Improving the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for advancing artificial intelligence. However, access to extensive, diverse, and high-quality reasoning datasets remains a significant challenge, particularly for the open-source community. In this paper, we propose ScaleQuest, a novel, scalable, and cost-effective data synthesis method that enables the generation of large-scale mathematical reasoning datasets using lightweight 7B-scale models. ScaleQuest introduces a two-stage question-tuning process comprising Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO) to unlock the question generation capabilities of problem-solving models. By generating diverse questions from scratch – without relying on powerful proprietary models or seed data – we produce a dataset of 1 million problem-solution pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained on our data outperform existing open-source datasets in both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations. Furthermore, our approach shows continued performance improvement as the volume of training data increases, highlighting its potential for ongoing data scaling. The extensive improvements observed in code reasoning tasks demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our proposed method.

In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring with 48.9K samples in total. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Dense retrieval has now become the mainstream paradigm in information retrieval. The core idea of dense retrieval is to align document embeddings with their corresponding query embeddings by maximizing their dot product. The current training data is quite sparse, with each document typically associated with only one or a few labeled queries. However, a single document can be retrieved by multiple different queries. Aligning a document with just one or a limited number of labeled queries results in a loss of its semantic information. In this paper, we propose a training-free Potential Query Retrieval (PQR) framework to address this issue. Specifically, we use a Gaussian mixture distribution to model all potential queries for a document, aiming to capture its comprehensive semantic information. To obtain this distribution, we introduce three sampling strategies to sample a large number of potential queries for each document and encode them into a semantic space. Using these sampled queries, we employ the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to estimate parameters of the distribution. Finally, we also propose a method to calculate similarity scores between user queries and documents under the PQR framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for the same concepts across languages. This alignment manifests concretely in generation: once an MLLM exhibits cross-lingual generalization according to our measures, we can select concept-specific neurons identified from, e.g., Spanish text and manipulate them to guide token predictions. Remarkably, rather than generating Spanish text, the model produces semantically coherent English text. This demonstrates that cross-lingually aligned neurons encode generalized semantic representations, independent of the original language encoding",

Moreover, even when domain-specific data is available, the lack of a unified methodology for benchmark dataset establishment often results in uneven data distribution. This imbalance can lead to an inaccurate assessment of the true model capabilities during the evaluation of domain-specific LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce **SDBench**, a generic framework for generating evaluation datasets for domain-specific LLMs. This method is also applicable for establishing the LLM instruction datasets. It significantly reduces the reliance on expert manpower while ensuring that the collected data is uniformly distributed.

However, current LLMs are limited to text-based communication, hindering their ability to interact with diverse forms of information in clinical environments. Despite clinical agents succeeding in diverse signal interaction, they are oriented to a single clinical scenario and hence fail for broader applications. To evaluate clinical agents holistically, we propose ClinicalAgent Bench (CAB), a comprehensive medical agent benchmark consisting of 18 tasks across five key realistic clinical dimensions. Building on this, we introduce ReflectTool, a novel framework that excels at utilizing domain-specific tools within two stages. The first optimization stage progressively enlarges a long-term memory by saving successful solving processes and tool-wise experience of agents in a tiny pre-defined training set. In the following inference stage, ReflectTool can search for supportive successful demonstrations from already built long-term memory to guide the tool selection strategy, and a verifier improves the tool usage according to the tool-wise experience with two verification methods–iterative refinement and candidate selection. Extensive experiments on CAB demonstrate that ReflectTool surpasses the pure LLMs with more than 10 points and the well-established agent-based methods with 3 points, highlighting its adaptability and effectiveness in solving complex clinical tasks.

We address this gap with Mystery-Zebra. This robust two-part benchmark (4,290 puzzles) challenges the logic abstraction abilities of LLMs in two setups: (1) a lexical obfuscation setup tests the dependence of LLMs on lexical content based on two canonical grid puzzles widely spread on the Internet; (2) a set of new grid puzzles in 42 different sizes and 12 difficulty levels tests how the formal difficulty degree of a puzzle affects LLMs.We test open and closed-weight LLMs on both parts of the benchmark. The results on part two suggest that model sizes up to 70B parameters have only a minor influence when solving newly generated puzzles, while performance mainly relates to the number of items in the puzzle. The results on the first part of the benchmark suggest that the applied obfuscation strategies help to mitigate effects of logic puzzles being part of LLM training data, showing a drastic drop in performance for obfuscated versions of well-known puzzles.

To this end, we propose a two-stage framework to learn and apply quantized codes for each entity, aiming for the seamless integration of KGs with LLMs. Firstly, a self-supervised quantized representation (SSQR) method is proposed to compress both KG structural and semantic knowledge into discrete codes (i.e., tokens) that align the format of language sentences. We further design KG instruction-following data by viewing these learned codes as features to directly input to LLMs, thereby achieving seamless integration. The experiment results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms existing unsupervised quantized methods, producing more distinguishable codes.

We follow the philosophy of tendency evaluation to empirically measure the stated \"desire\" of LLMs via fine-grained multiple-choice question answering. The dataset consists of 14,888 questions that simulate scenarios related to predefined 7 types of frontier risks. Each question is accompanied with 4 answer choices that state opinions or behavioral tendencies corresponding to the question. All answer choices are manually annotated with one of the defined risk levels so that we can easily build a fine-grained frontier risk profile for each assessed LLM. Extensive evaluation with CRiskEval on a spectrum of prevalent Chinese LLMs has unveiled a striking revelation: most models exhibit risk tendencies of more than 40% (weighted tendency to the four risk levels). Furthermore, a subtle increase in the model's inclination toward urgent self-sustainability, power seeking and other dangerous goals becomes evident as the size of models increases. To promote further research on the frontier risk evaluation of LLMs, we publicly release our dataset at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/CRiskEval",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Mixture-of-experts (MoEs) have been adopted for reducing inference costs by sparsely activating experts in large language models (LLMs). Despite these reductions, the massive number of parameters in MoEs still makes them expensive to serve. Conventionally, unstructured or structured pruning has been considered to reduce number of parameters. Our key contribution is exploring the interpolation between structured and unstructured pruning, to propose a novel structured-then-unstructured (STUN) approach outperforming both of structured or unstructured pruning, especially for MoEs. In the first stage, we show a scalable expert pruning with O(1) forward pass, unlike existing work requiring O(kn⁄√n) forward passes for n experts that cannot scale for recent MoEs with hundreds of experts. We then show our expert-pruned MoEs are robust to unstructured pruning to follow. Experiments on Snowflake Arctic and Mixtral shows that our proposal is highly effective– For Snowflake Arctic, a 480B-sized MoE with 128 experts, our method needs only one H100 and two hours to achieve nearly no loss in performance with 40% sparsity, even in generative tasks such as GSM8K, where state-of-the-art structured or unstructured pruning methods fail.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Information theft attacks pose a significant risk to Large Language Model (LLM) tool-learning systems. Adversaries can inject malicious commands through compromised tools, manipulating LLMs to send sensitive information to these tools, which leads to potential privacy breaches. However, existing attack approaches are black-box oriented and rely on static commands that cannot adapt flexibly to the changes in user queries and the invocation chain of tools. It makes malicious commands more likely to be detected by LLM and leads to attack failure. In this paper, we propose AutoCMD, a dynamic attack comment generation approach for information theft attacks in LLM tool-learning systems. Inspired by the concept of mimicking the familiar, AutoCMD is capable of inferring the information utilized by upstream tools in the toolchain through learning on open-source systems and reinforcement with target system examples, thereby generating more targeted commands for information theft. The evaluation results show that AutoCMD outperforms the baselines with +13.2% ASRTheft, and can be generalized to new tool-learning systems to expose their information leakage risks. We also design four defense methods to effectively protect tool-learning systems from the attack",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have markedly enhanced text-to-audio generation, yet their iterative sampling processes impose substantial computational demands, limiting practical deployment. While recent methods utilizing consistency-based distillation aim to achieve few-step or single-step inference, their one-step performance is constrained by curved trajectories, preventing them from surpassing traditional diffusion models. In this work, we introduce FlashAudio with rectified flows to learn straight flow for fast simulation. To alleviate the inefficient timesteps allocation and suboptimal distribution of noise, FlashAudio optimizes the time distribution of rectified flow with Bifocal Samplers and proposes immiscible flow to minimize the total distance of data-noise pairs in a batch vias assignment. Furthermore, to address the amplified accumulation error caused by the classifier-free guidance (CFG), we propose Anchored Optimization, which refines the guidance scale by anchoring it to a reference trajectory. Experimental results on text-to-audio generation demonstrate that FlashAudio's one-step generation performance surpasses the diffusion-based models with hundreds of sampling steps on audio quality and enables a sampling speed of 400x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in knowledge-intensive tasks, while they remain vulnerable when encountering misinformation. Existing studies have explored the role of LLMs in combating misinformation, but there is still a lack of fine-grained analysis on the specific aspects and extent to which LLMs are influenced by misinformation. To bridge this gap, we present MisBench, the current largest and most comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' behavior and knowledge preference toward misinformation. MisBench consists of 10,346,712 pieces of misinformation, which uniquely considers both knowledge-based conflicts and stylistic variations in misinformation. Empirical results reveal that while LLMs demonstrate comparable abilities in discerning misinformation, they still remain susceptible to knowledge conflicts and stylistic variations. Based on these findings, we further propose a novel approach called Reconstruct to Discriminate (RtD) to strengthen LLMs' ability to detect misinformation. Our study provides valuable insights into LLMs' interactions with misinformation, and we believe MisBench can serve as an effective benchmark for evaluating LLM-based detectors and enhancing their reliability in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with six different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder",

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in supporting DDx, existing approaches face key limitations, including single-dataset evaluations, isolated optimization of components, unrealistic assumptions about complete patient profiles, and single-attempt diagnosis. We introduce a Modular Explainable DDx Agent (MEDDxAgent) framework designed for interactive DDx, where diagnostic reasoning evolves through iterative learning, rather than assuming a complete patient profile is accessible. MEDDxAgent integrates three modular components: (1) an orchestrator (DDxDriver), (2) a history taking simulator, and (3) two specialized agents for knowledge retrieval and diagnosis strategy. To ensure robust evaluation, we introduce a comprehensive DDx benchmark covering respiratory, skin, and rare diseases. We analyze single-turn diagnostic approaches and demonstrate the importance of iterative refinement when patient profiles are not available at the outset. Our broad evaluation demonstrates that MEDDxAgent achieves over 10% accuracy improvements in interactive DDx across both large and small LLMs, while offering critical explainability into its diagnostic reasoning process",

While conventional CSC focuses on character substitution errors caused by mistyping, two other common types of character errors, missing and redundant characters, have received less attention. These errors are often excluded from CSC datasets during the annotation process or ignored during evaluation, even when they have been annotated. This issue limits the practicality of the CSC task. To address this issue, we introduce the task of General Chinese Character Error Correction (C2EC), which focuses on all three types of character errors. We construct a high-quality C2EC benchmark by combining and manually verifying data from CCTC and Lemon datasets. We extend the training-free prompt-free CSC method to C2EC by using Levenshtein distance for handling length changes and leveraging an additional prompt-based large language model (LLM) to improve performance. Experiments show that our method enables a 14B-parameter LLM to be on par with models nearly 50 times larger on both conventional CSC and C2EC tasks, without any fine-tuning",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1) Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following, demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000 training entries.

    "abstract": "Current multi-task adversarial text attacks rely on abundant access to shared internal features and numerous queries, often limited to a single task type. As a result, these attacks are less effective against practical scenarios involving black-box feedback APIs, limited queries, or multiple task types. To bridge this gap, we propose Cluster and Ensemble Mutil-task Text Adversarial Attack (CEMA), an effective black-box attack that exploits the transferability of adversarial texts across different tasks. CEMA simplifies complex multi-task scenarios by using a deep-level substitute model trained in a plug-and-play manner for text classification, enabling attacks without mimicking the victim model. This approach requires only a few queries for training, converting multi-task attacks into classification attacks and allowing attacks across various tasks. CEMA generates multiple adversarial candidates using different text classification methods and selects the one that most effectively attacks substitute models. In experiments involving multi-task models with two, three, or six tasks—spanning classification, translation, summarization, and text-to-image generation—CEMA demonstrates significant attack success with as few as 100 queries. Furthermore, CEMA can target commercial APIs (e.g., Baidu and Google Translate), large language models (e.g., ChatGPT 4o), and image-generation models (e.g., Stable Diffusion V2), showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in real-world applications",

    "abstract": "Dialogue Aspect-based Sentiment Quadruple (DiaASQ) analysis aims to identify all quadruples (i.e., target, aspect, opinion, sentiment) from the dialogue. This task is challenging as different elements within a quadruple may manifest in different utterances, requiring precise handling of associations at both the utterance and word levels. However, most existing methods tackling it predominantly leverage predefined dialogue structure (e.g., reply) and word semantics, resulting in a surficial understanding of the deep sentiment association between utterances and words. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-level Association Refinement Network (MARN) designed to achieve more accurate and comprehensive sentiment associations between utterances and words. Specifically, for utterances, we dynamically capture their associations with enriched semantic features through a holistic understanding of the dialogue, aligning them more closely with sentiment associations within elements in quadruples. For words, we develop a novel cross-utterance syntax parser (CU-Parser) that fully exploits syntactic information to enhance the association between word pairs within and across utterances. Moreover, to address the scarcity of labeled data in DiaASQ, we further introduce a multi-view data augmentation strategy to enhance the performance of MARN under low-resource conditions.

Furthermore, we introduce CrossCred, a new benchmark of real-world fraudulent images with fine-grained manual annotations. Experiments demonstrate that CSIAD outperforms state-of-the-art image fraud detection methods by 79.6% (F1) on CrossCred and deployed industrial solutions by 21.7% (F1) on business data.

    "title": "Cooperative or Competitive? Understanding the Interaction between Attention Heads From A Game Theory Perspective",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success of attention-based large language models (LLMs), the precise interaction mechanisms between attention heads remain poorly understood. In contrast to prevalent methods that focus on individual head contributions, we rigorously analyze the intricate interplay among attention heads through a novel framework based on the Harsanyi dividend, a concept from cooperative game theory. Our analysis reveals that significant positive Harsanyi dividends are sparsely distributed across head combinations, indicating that most heads do not contribute cooperatively. Moreover, certain head combinations exhibit negative dividends, indicating implicit competitive relationships. To further optimize the interactions among attention heads, we propose a training-free Game-theoretic Attention Calibration (GAC) method. Specifically, GAC selectively retains heads demonstrating significant cooperative gains and applies fine-grained distributional adjustments to the remaining heads. Comprehensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GAC and its superior generalization capabilities across diverse model families, scales, and modalities. Crucially, the discovered interaction phenomena offer a path toward a deeper understanding of the behaviors of LLMs",

    "abstract": "According to the Test-Time Scaling, the integration of External Slow-Thinking with the Verify mechanism has been demonstrated to enhance multi-round reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, in the multimodal (MM) domain, there is still a lack of a strong MM-Verifier. In this paper, we introduce MM-Verifier and MM-Reasoner to enhance multimodal reasoning through longer inference and more robust verification. First, we propose a two-step MM verification data synthesis method, which combines a simulation-based tree search with verification and uses rejection sampling to generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (COT) data. This data is then used to fine-tune the verification model, MM-Verifier. Additionally, we present a more efficient method for synthesizing MMCOT data, bridging the gap between text-based and multimodal reasoning. The synthesized data is used to fine-tune MM-Reasoner. Our MM-Verifier outperforms all larger models on the MathCheck, MathVista, and MathVerse benchmarks. Moreover, MM-Reasoner demonstrates strong effectiveness and scalability, with performance improving as data size increases. Finally, our approach achieves strong performance when combining MM-Reasoner and MM-Verifier, reaching an accuracy of 65.3 on MathVista, surpassing GPT-4o (63.8) with 12 rollouts",

In this work, we propose to represent the trajectory as a graph that can capture the hierarchy as well as the visiting order, and construct a benchmark dataset for the trajectory extraction.

This paper proposes a novel ̲First- ̲Order ̲Logic reasoning framework for ̲AM (FOL-AM), designed to explicitly capture logical reasoning paths within argumentative texts. By interpreting multiple AM subtasks as a unified relation query task modeled using FOL rules, FOL-AM facilitates multi-hop relational reasoning and enhances interpretability.

Nevertheless, for broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16 mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and reliability in temporal analysis",

In this work, we propose UniRAG, a unified framework for query understanding in RAG. UniRAG employs a decoder-only LLM to jointly perform query augmentation and encoding, eliminating task separation. To facilitate adaptive query augmentation, we categorize existing techniques into query paraphrasing, query expansion, and query abstraction. Our model learns to select the optimal augmentation strategy based on user queries, leveraging retrieval and generation outputs as feedback. Experimental results show that UniRAG significantly outperforms traditional query augmentation methods in five knowledge-intensive benchmark tasks in both closed and open domain question answering",

Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER surpasses the tree search method with much fewer token costs and achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%.

However, there is a lack of work evaluating MLLM for higher-order perception and understanding of Chinese visual content. To address this, we introduce the CII-Bench, which aims to assess MLLMs' such capabilities for Chinese images. To ensure the authenticity of the Chinese context, images in CII-Bench are sourced from the Chinese Internet and manually reviewed, with corresponding answers also manually crafted. Additionally, CII-Bench incorporates images that represent Chinese traditional culture, such as famous Chinese traditional paintings, which can deeply reflect the model's understanding of Chinese traditional culture. Through experiments on multiple MLLMs using CII-Bench, significant findings emerged. There is a large gap between MLLMs and humans in performance. The highest MLLM accuracy is 64.4%, while the human average is 78.2% and the peak is 81.0%. MLLMs perform poorly on traditional culture images, indicating limitations in understanding high-level semantics and lacking a deep knowledge base of Chinese traditional culture. Moreover, most models have higher accuracy when image emotion hints are added to the prompts. We believe CII-Bench will help MLLMs better understand Chinese semantics and specific images, and move forward the development of expert artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Existing methods typically apply the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and inputs. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the inherent diversity of attention patterns within LLMs — the intrinsic attention clustering. To address this, we propose ClusterAttn, a training-free sparse attention method that provides an efficient prompt cache compression scheme under intrinsic attention clustering for efficient LLM inference.Our findings show that attention heads consistently focus on specific clusters of the prompt during decoding, a pattern detectable from an observation window at the prompt's end. ClusterAttn adaptively fits these clusters utilizing a density-based attention clustering algorithm, thus compressing the KV cache of the prompt. Evaluations on different models across various benchmarks demonstrate ClusterAttn's superior compression rates and efficiency. By utilizing only 1024 tokens, it can reduce memory usage by 10%–65%, resulting in a latency reduction of 12%–23% and a throughput increase of 2.6–4.8 times, all with nearly no accuracy loss.

    "abstract": "Shared memories between two individuals strengthen their bond and are crucial for facilitating their ongoing conversations. This study aims to make long-term dialogue more engaging by leveraging these shared memories. To this end, we introduce a new long-term dialogue dataset named SHARE, constructed from movie scripts, which are a rich source of shared memories among various relationships. Our dialogue dataset contains the summaries of persona information and events of two individuals, as explicitly revealed in their conversation, along with implicitly extractable shared memories. We also introduce EPISODE, a long-term dialogue framework based on SHARE that utilizes shared experiences between individuals. Through experiments using SHARE, we demonstrate that shared memories between two individuals make long-term dialogues more engaging and sustainable, and that EPISODE effectively manages shared memories during dialogue.

    "title": "Incongruity-aware Tension Field Network for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal sarcasm detection (MSD) identifies sarcasm and accurately understands users' real attitudes from text-image pairs. Most MSD researches explore the incongruity of text-image pairs as sarcasm information through consistency preference methods. However, these methods prioritize consistency over incongruity and blur incongruity information under their global feature aggregation mechanisms, leading to incongruity distortions and model misinterpretations. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a pioneering inconsistency preference method called incongruity-aware tension field network (ITFNet) for multi-modal sarcasm detection tasks. Specifically, ITFNet extracts effective text-image feature pairs in fact and sentiment perspectives. It then constructs a fact/sentiment tension field with discrepancy metrics to capture the contextual tone and polarized incongruity after the iterative learning of tension intensity, effectively highlighting incongruity information during such inconsistency preference learning. It further standardizes the polarized incongruity with reference to contextual tone to obtain standardized incongruity, effectively implementing instance standardization for unbiased decision-making in MSD. ITFNet performs well in extracting salient and standardized incongruity through an incongruity-aware tension field, significantly tackling incongruity distortions and cross-instance variance. Moreover, ITFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing LLaVA1.5-7B with only 17.3M trainable parameters, demonstrating its optimal performance-efficiency in multi-modal sarcasm detection tasks",

However, the privacy risks associated with this framework, particularly due to the potential inclusion of sensitive data in training datasets, remain unexplored. This paper identifies a novel and realistic attack surface: the privacy leakage from training data in decentralized training, and proposes activation inversion attack (AIA) for the first time. AIA first constructs a shadow dataset comprising text labels and corresponding activations using public datasets. Leveraging this dataset, an attack model can be trained to reconstruct the training data from activations in victim decentralized training. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLMs and publicly available datasets to demonstrate the susceptibility of decentralized training to AIA.

However, achieving low latency and natural interactions in full-duplex dialogue systems remains a significant challenge, especially considering human conversation dynamics such as interruptions, backchannels, and overlapping speech. In this paper, we introduce a novel End-to-End GPT-based model OmniFlatten for full-duplex conversation, capable of effectively modeling the complex behaviors inherent to natural conversations with low latency. To achieve full-duplex conversation capabilities, we propose a multi-stage post-training scheme that progressively adapts a text large language model (LLM) backbone into a speech-text dialogue LLM, capable of generating text and speech in real time, without modifying the architecture of the backbone LLM. The training process comprises three stages: modality alignment, half-duplex dialogue learning, and full-duplex dialogue learning. In all training stages, we standardize the data using a flattening operation, which enables unifying the training methods and the GPT backbone across different modalities and tasks. Our approach offers a simple modeling technique and a promising research direction for developing efficient and natural end-to-end full-duplex spoken dialogue systems",

Building on this, continual DAP has been explored to develop pre-trained models capable of incrementally incorporating different domain datasets. However, existing continual DAP methods face several limitations: (1) high computational cost and GPU memory usage during training; (2) sensitivity to incremental data order; and (3) providing a single, generalized model for all end tasks, which contradicts the essence of DAP. In this paper, we propose DoMIX, a novel approach that addresses these challenges by leveraging LoRA modules, a representative parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method. Our approach enables efficient and parallel domain-adaptive pre-training that is robust to domain order and effectively utilizes accumulated knowledge to provide tailored pre-trained models for specific tasks.We also demonstrate that our method can be extended beyond the DAP setting to standard LLM fine-tuning scenarios.

While preference alignment methods have proven effective in general domains, acquiring high-quality preference data for pathology remains challenging due to limited expert resources and domain complexity. In this paper, we propose EAGLE (Expert-guided self-enhancement for preference Alignment in patholoGy Large vision-languagE model), a novel framework that systematically integrates medical expertise into preference alignment. EAGLE consists of three key stages: initialization through supervised fine-tuning, self-preference creation leveraging expert prompting and medical entity recognition, and iterative preference following-tuning. The self-preference creation stage uniquely combines expert-verified chosen sampling with expert-guided rejected sampling to generate high-quality preference data, while the iterative tuning process continuously refines both data quality and model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EAGLE significantly outperforms existing pathological LVLMs, effectively reducing hallucination and bias while maintaining pathological accuracy.

We train decoder-only transformers (up to 700M parameters) on these datasets and show that CoT accelerates the accuracy transition to higher values across model sizes. In particular, we find that model depth is crucial for leveraging CoT with limited in-context examples, while more examples help shallow models match deeper model performance. Additionally, limiting the diversity of token processing functions throughout training improves causal structure learning via ICL. We also interpret these transitions by analyzing transformer embeddings and attention maps. Overall, CoT-ICL Lab serves as a simple yet powerful testbed for theoretical and empirical insights into ICL and CoT in language models",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capability while lack explicit mechanisms for visual grounding and segmentation, creating a gap between cognitive reasoning and visual perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Reasoning Segmentation via Visual Prompting (RSVP), a novel framework that unifies multi-step multimodal reasoning with grounded visual understanding. RSVP is a two-stage structuralized framework that integrates reasoning-driven localization with segmentation refinement. In the reasoning stage, RSVP employs multimodal chain-of-thought visual prompts to help MLLMs understand queries and infer targets, generating interpretable region proposals that enhance visual grounding. In segmentation stage, RSVP refines these proposals with a Vision-Language Segmentation Module (VLSM), seamlessly integrates textual and visual cues to produce precise segmentation masks. By explicitly modelling the interaction between multimodal reasoning and segmentation, RSVP introduces a new paradigm for interpretable reasoning segmentation. It exploits MLLMs' inherent localization capabilities, enabling the models to not only reason about objects but also generate structured visual representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpasses state-of-the-art methods by up to +6.5 gIoU and +9.2 cIoU on ReasonSeg, and achieves 49.7 mAP on SegInW under zero-shot settings.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a common method for fine-tuning large language models, where a base model can serve multiple users through PEFT module switching. To enhance user experience, base models require periodic updates. However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous versions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions. Re-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant computational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur during base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual training primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward Networks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the Attention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel approach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern while reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model. Further theoretical analysis supports our approach. Extensive experiments across 7 base models and 12 datasets demonstrate that Trans-PEFT trained modules can maintain performance on updated base models without re-tuning, significantly reducing maintenance overhead in real-world applications",

Our results reveal significant shortcomings in current VLMs in reasoning over handwritten text, with Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest error correction rate (77%). We also observed that some models struggle with processing handwritten content, as their accuracy improves when handwritten inputs are replaced with printed text or images.

    "abstract": "Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit parameter constraints. We propose GORP ( ̲Gradient L ̲Ow ̲Rank ̲Projection) for Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP",

    "title": "Towards Objective Fine-tuning: How LLMs' Prior Knowledge Causes Potential Poor Calibration?",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) often demonstrate poor calibration, with their confidence scores misaligned with actual performance. While calibration has been extensively studied in models trained from scratch, the impact of LLMs' prior knowledge on calibration during fine-tuning remains understudied. Our research reveals that LLMs' prior knowledge causes potential poor calibration due to the ubiquitous presence of known data in real-world fine-tuning, which appears harmful for calibration. Specifically, data aligned with LLMs' prior knowledge would induce overconfidence, while new knowledge improves calibration. Our findings expose a tension: LLMs' encyclopedic knowledge, while enabling task versatility, undermines calibration through unavoidable knowledge overlaps. To address this, we propose CogCalib, a cognition-aware framework that applies targeted learning strategies according to the model's prior knowledge. Experiments across 7 tasks using 3 LLM families prove that CogCalib significantly improves calibration while maintaining performance, achieving an average 57% reduction in ECE compared to standard fine-tuning in Llama3-8B. These improvements generalize well to out-of-domain tasks, enhancing the objectivity and reliability of domain-specific LLMs, and making them more trustworthy for critical human-AI interaction applications",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Sustainability reports are key for evaluating companies' environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. To analyze these reports, NLP approaches can efficiently extract ESG insights at scale. However, even the most advanced NLP methods lack robustness against ESG content that is greenwashed – i.e. sustainability claims that are misleading, exaggerated, and fabricated. Accordingly, existing NLP approaches often extract insights that reflect misleading or exaggerated sustainability claims rather than objective ESG performance. To tackle this issue, we introduce A3CG - **A**spect-**A**ction **A**nalysis with Cross-**C**ategory **G**eneralization, as a novel dataset to improve the robustness of ESG analysis amid the prevalence of greenwashing. By explicitly linking sustainability aspects with their associated actions, A3CG facilitates a more fine-grained and transparent evaluation of sustainability claims, ensuring that insights are grounded in verifiable actions rather than vague or misleading rhetoric. Additionally, A3CG emphasizes cross-category generalization. This ensures robust model performance in aspect-action analysis even when companies change their reports to selectively favor certain sustainability areas. Through experiments on A3CG, we analyze state-of-the-art supervised models and LLMs, uncovering their limitations and outlining key directions for future research",

    "abstract": "The integration of additional modalities increases the susceptibility of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to safety risks, such as jailbreak attacks, compared to their language-only counterparts. While existing research primarily focuses on post-hoc alignment techniques, the underlying safety mechanisms within LVLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work , we investigate whether LVLMs inherently encode safety-relevant signals within their internal activations during inference. Our findings reveal that LVLMs exhibit distinct activation patterns when processing unsafe prompts, which can be leveraged to detect and mitigate adversarial inputs without requiring extensive fine-tuning. Building on this insight, we introduce HiddenDetect, a novel tuning-free framework that harnesses internal model activations to enhance safety. Experimental results show that HiddenDetect surpasses state-of-the-art methods in detecting jailbreak attacks against LVLMs. By utilizing intrinsic safety-aware patterns, our method provides an efficient and scalable solution for strengthening LVLM robustness against multimodal threats.

Our systematic evaluation reveals that frontier models achieve superior translation performance across all document types, while specialized translation systems excel specifically in laws but under-perform in headnotes. Through rigorous testing and human expert validation, we demonstrate that while fine-tuning open SLMs significantly improves their translation quality, they still lag behind the best zero-shot prompted frontier models such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet.

In this paper, we build on this idea by extending the refinement from sentence-level to document-level translation, specifically focusing on document-to-document (Doc2Doc) translation refinement. Since sentence-to-sentence (Sent2Sent) and Doc2Doc translation address different aspects of the translation process, we propose fine-tuning LLMs for translation refinement using two intermediate translations, combining the strengths of both Sent2Sent and Doc2Doc. Additionally, recognizing that the quality of intermediate translations varies, we introduce an enhanced fine-tuning method with quality awareness that assigns lower weights to easier translations and higher weights to more difficult ones, enabling the model to focus on challenging translation cases.

Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have made progress in identifying circuits, the minimal computational subgraphs responsible for a model's behavior on specific tasks. However, most studies focus on identifying circuits for individual tasks without investigating how functionally similar circuits relate to each other. To address this gap, we study the modularity of neural networks by analyzing circuits for highly compositional subtasks within a transformer-based language model. Specifically, given a probabilistic context-free grammar, we identify and compare circuits responsible for ten modular string-edit operations. Our results indicate that functionally similar circuits exhibit both notable node overlap and cross-task faithfulness. Moreover, we demonstrate that the circuits identified can be reused and combined through set operations to represent more complex functional model capabilities",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are widely used, but they often generate subtle factual errors, especially in long-form text. These errors are fatal in some specialized domains such as medicine. Existing fact-checking with grounding documents methods face two main challenges: (1) they struggle to understand complex multihop relations in long documents, often overlooking subtle factual errors; (2) most specialized methods rely on pairwise comparisons, requiring multiple model calls, leading to high resource and computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose GraphCheck, a fact-checking framework that uses extracted knowledge graphs to enhance text representation. Graph Neural Networks further process these graphs as a soft prompt, enabling LLMs to incorporate structured knowledge more effectively. Enhanced with graph-based reasoning, GraphCheck captures multihop reasoning chains that are often overlooked by existing methods, enabling precise and efficient fact-checking in a single inference call. Experimental results on seven benchmarks spanning both general and medical domains demonstrate up to a 7.1% overall improvement over baseline models. Notably, GraphCheck outperforms existing specialized fact-checkers and achieves comparable performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, such as DeepSeek-V3 and OpenAI-o1, with significantly fewer parameters",

SCULPT represents prompts as tree structures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual integrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and applies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's effectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and its ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial human-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT consistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information while applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt modifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks",

Thus, to validate RP-LLMs' effectiveness, we introduced a new benchmark containing an evaluation standard, a test dataset with manual annotations, and a reward model RoleRM designed to automatically assess specific aspects of RP while aligning with human perception. Sufficient experiments reveal that RoleRM significantly outperforms ChatGPT and other evaluation methods in conducting fine-grained evaluations of RP. Also, RP-LLMs powered by Crab demonstrate superior performance across various fine-grained aspects",

CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource. Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400 samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data. Furthermore, we find that SFT is particularly sensitive to data quantity in medium and low-resource languages, whereas CLO remains robust.

    "title": "Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region",

    "title": "LLaVA Steering: Visual Instruction Tuning with 500x Fewer Parameters through Modality Linear Representation-Steering",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enhance visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, enables instruction following and in-context learning, while the visual modality boosts downstream task performance through rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning, regardless of using full or parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). We found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce trainable parameters, inspiring further optimization of visual instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS), which re-balances intrinsic modalities by steering visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. We validated our approach by developing LLaVA Steering, a suite of models using MoReS. Results show that LLaVA Steering requires, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA while maintaining comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Finally, we introduce the LLaVA Steering Factory, a platform that enables rapid customization of MLLMs with a component-based architecture, seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models and evaluating intrinsic modality imbalance. This open-source project facilitates a deeper understanding of MLLMs within the research community",

    "abstract": "Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm to perform Information Retrieval (IR), which enables the direct ingestion and retrieval of information by processing an entire corpus in their single context, showcasing the potential to surpass traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods. However, processing a large number of passages within in-context for retrieval is computationally expensive, and handling their representations during inference further exacerbates the processing time; thus, we aim to make LCLM retrieval more efficient and potentially more effective with passage compression. Specifically, we propose a new compression approach tailored for LCLM retrieval, which is trained to maximize the retrieval performance while minimizing the length of the compressed passages. To accomplish this, we generate the synthetic data, where compressed passages are automatically created and labeled as chosen or rejected according to their retrieval success for a given query, and we train the proposed Compression model for Long context Retrieval (CoLoR) with this data via preference optimization while adding the length regularization loss on top of it to enforce brevity. Through extensive experiments on 9 datasets, we show that CoLoR improves the retrieval performance by 6% while compressing the in-context size by a factor of 1.91.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, in knowledge graph question answering tasks (KGQA), there remains the issue of answering questions that require multi-hop reasoning. Existing methods rely on entity vector matching, but the purpose of the question is abstract and difficult to match with specific entities. As a result, it is difficult to establish reasoning paths to the purpose, which leads to information loss and redundancy. To address this issue, inspired by human reverse thinking, we propose Ontology-Guided Reverse Thinking (ORT), a novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to conditions. ORT operates in three key phases: (1) using LLM to extract purpose labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge retrieval. Experiments on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets show that ORT achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly enhances the capability of LLMs for KGQA",

    "abstract": "Large language models hold promise for addressing medical challenges, such as medical diagnosis reasoning, research knowledge acquisition, clinical decision-making, and consumer health inquiry support. However, they often generate hallucinations due to limited medical knowledge. Incorporating external knowledge is therefore critical, which necessitates multi-source knowledge acquisition. We address this challenge by framing it as a source planning problem, which is to formulate context-appropriate queries tailored to the attributes of diverse sources. Existing approaches either overlook source planning or fail to achieve it effectively due to misalignment between the model's expectation of the sources and their actual content. To bridge this gap, we present MedOmniKB, a repository comprising multigenre and multi-structured medical knowledge sources. Leveraging these sources, we propose the Source Planning Optimisation method, which enhances multi-source utilisation. Our approach involves enabling an expert model to explore and evaluate potential plans while training a smaller model to learn source alignment.

To bridge this gap, we introduce QAEdit, a new benchmark aligned with widely used question answering (QA) datasets, and WILD, a task-agnostic evaluation framework designed to better reflect real-world usage of model editing. Our single editing experiments show that current editing methods perform substantially worse than previously reported (38.5% vs. 96.8%). We demonstrate that it stems from issues in the synthetic evaluation practices of prior work. Among them, the most severe is the use of teacher forcing during testing, which leaks both content and length of the ground truth, leading to overestimated performance. Furthermore, we simulate practical deployment by sequential editing, revealing that current approaches fail drastically with only 1000 edits.

Existing attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims.

In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task, including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2) suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3) proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized attribution in content-grounded generation",

    "abstract": "LLMs such as GPT-4 have shown a remarkable ability to solve complex questions by generating step-by-step rationales. Prior works have utilized this capability to improve smaller and cheaper LMs (say, with 7B parameters). However, various practical constraints, such as copyright and legal issues, owing to lack of transparency in the pre-training data of large (often closed) models, prevent their use in commercial settings. Little focus has been given to improving the innate reasoning ability of smaller models without distilling information from larger LLMs. To address this, we propose COLLATE, a trainable framework that tunes a (small) LLM to generate those outputs from a pool of diverse rationales that selectively improves the downstream task. COLLATE enforces multiple instances of the same LLM to exhibit distinct behavior and employs them to generate rationales to obtain diverse outputs. The LLM is then tuned via preference optimization to choose the candidate rationale which maximizes the likelihood of ground-truth answer. COLLATE outperforms several trainable and prompting baselines on 5 datasets across 3 domains - maths problem solving, natural language inference, and commonsense reasoning. We show the efficacy of COLLATE on LLMs from different model families across varying parameter scales (1B to 8B) and demonstrate the benefit of multiple rationale providers guided by the end task through ablations.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent LLMs exhibit limited effectiveness on molecular property prediction task due to the semantic gap between molecular representations and natural language, as well as the lack of domain-specific knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose MolRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework integrating Chain-of-Thought reasoning for molecular property prediction. MolRAG operates by retrieving structurally analogous molecules as contextual references to guide stepwise knowledge reasoning through chemical structure-property relationships. This dual mechanism synergizes molecular similarity analysis with structured inference, while generating human-interpretable rationales grounded in domain knowledge. Experimental results show MolRAG outperforms pre-trained LLMs on four datasets, and even matches supervised methods, achieving performance gains of 1.1%–45.7% over direct prediction approaches, demonstrating versatile effectiveness.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to assess NLP tasks due to their ability to generate human-like judgments. Single LLMs were used initially, however, recent work suggests using multiple LLMs as judges yields improved performance. An important step in exploiting multiple judgements is the combination stage, aggregation. Existing methods in NLP either assign equal weight to all LLM judgments or are designed for specific tasks such as hallucination detection. This work focuses on aggregating predictions from multiple systems where no reference labels are available. A new method called SkillAggregation is proposed, which learns to combine estimates from LLM judges without needing additional data or ground truth. It extends the Crowdlayer aggregation method, developed for image classification, to exploit the judge estimates during inference. The approach is compared to a range of standard aggregation methods on HaluEval-Dialogue, TruthfulQA and Chatbot Arena tasks. SkillAggregation outperforms Crowdlayer on all tasks, and yields the best performance over all approaches on the majority of tasks",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to push the boundaries of LLM capabilities, yet they often incur significant costs and face challenges in dynamic LLM selection. Current LLM routing methods effectively reduce overhead in single-agent scenarios by customizing LLM selection for each query, but they overlook the critical decisions regarding collaboration modes and agent roles in MAS. In response to this challenge, we first introduce the problem of Multi-Agent System Routing (MASR), which integrates all components of MAS into a unified routing framework. Toward this goal, we propose MasRouter, the first high-performing, cost-effective, and inductive MASR solution. MasRouter employs collaboration mode determination, role allocation, and LLM routing through a cascaded controller network, progressively constructing a MAS that balances effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MasRouter is (1) high-performing, achieving a 1.8 improvement over the state-of-the-art method on MBPP; (2) economical, reducing overhead by up to 52.07 compared to SOTA methods on HumanEval; and (3) plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating with mainstream MAS frameworks, reducing overhead by 17.21 via customized routing",

    "abstract": "Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) enhance recommendation quality by engaging users in multi-turn dialogues, capturing nuanced preferences through natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations. Expanding the label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate significant and consistent performance improvements across various recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS performance",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Evaluating models on large benchmarks can be very resource-intensive, especially during a period of rapid model evolution. Existing efficient evaluation methods estimate the performance of target models by testing them on a small, static coreset derived from the publicly available evaluation results of source models, which are separate from the target models. However, these approaches rely on the assumption that target models have high prediction consistency with source models, which doesn't generalize well in practice. To fill this gap, we propose TailoredBench, a method that conducts customized evaluation tailored to each target model. Specifically, a Global-coreset is first constructed as a probe to identify the most consistent source models for each target model with an adaptive source model selection strategy. Afterwards, a scalable K-Medoids clustering algorithm is proposed to extend the Global-coreset to a tailored Native-coreset for each target model. According to the predictions on respective Native-coreset, we estimate the overall performance of target models with a calibrated estimation strategy. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks across over 300 models demonstrate that compared to best performing baselines, TailoredBench achieves an average reduction of 31.4% in MAE of accuracy estimates under the same inference budgets, showcasing strong effectiveness and generalizability",

Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1) maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2) avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20 LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications.

To address this issue, we propose MLAS-LoRA, a novel multiple language-aware LoRA knowledge transfer framework. MLAS-LoRA efficiently adapts LLMs to MT by selectively transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a small student model. Our approach first evaluates the awareness of neurons and extracts linguistic knowledge in the teacher model to both the general MT task and specific language pairs.We then propose a multiple language-specific LoRA architecture to inject the extracted knowledge into the student model. During fine-tuning, only the parameters of the relevant language-general and language-specific LoRA modules are updated. Experimental results on diverse multilingual language pairs demonstrate that MLAS-LoRA significantly outperforms strong baselines by +1.7 BLEU on average, including standard fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient methods",

Through this self-validation process, our PageRank-inspired algorithm iteratively updates the ranking score of each code snippet, ultimately creating a code preference optimization dataset based on correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO is flexible and scalable, generating diverse preference optimization data without depending on powerful models such as GPT-4. Through comprehensive evaluations of five widely used benchmarks, CodeDPO demonstrates significant improvements in correctness and efficiency compared to existing methods.

    "abstract": "Topic models and document-clustering evaluations either use automated metrics that align poorly with human preferences, or require expert labels that are intractable to scale. We design a scalable human evaluation protocol and a corresponding automated approximation that reflect practitioners' real-world usage of models. Annotators—or an LLM-based proxy—review text items assigned to a topic or cluster, infer a category for the group, then apply that category to other documents. Using this protocol, we collect extensive crowdworker annotations of outputs from a diverse set of topic models on two datasets. We then use these annotations to validate automated proxies, finding that the best LLM proxy is statistically indistinguishable from a human annotator and can therefore serve as a reasonable substitute in automated evaluations",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled social simulation through multi-agent systems. Prior efforts focus on agent societies created from scratch, assigning agents with newly defined personas. However, simulating established fictional worlds and characters remain largely underexplored, despite its significant practical value. In this paper, we introduce BookWorld, a comprehensive system for constructing and simulating book-based multi-agent societies. BookWorld's design covers comprehensive real-world intricacies, including diverse and dynamic characters, fictional worldviews, geographical constraints and changes, e.t.c. BookWorld enables diverse applications including story generation, interactive games and social simulation, offering novel ways to extend and explore beloved fictional works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that BookWorld generates creative, high-quality stories while maintaining fidelity to the source books, surpassing previous methods with a win rate of 75.36%.

While existing methods using embeddings from a diachronic corpus pair estimate the degree of change for target words, they offer limited insight into changes at the level of individual usage instances. To address this, we apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) to sets of contextualized word embeddings, capturing semantic change through the excess and deficit in the alignment between usage instances. In particular, we propose Sense Usage Shift (SUS), a measure that quantifies changes in the usage frequency of a word sense at each usage instance. By leveraging SUS, we demonstrate that several challenges in semantic change detection can be addressed in a unified manner, including quantifying instance-level semantic change and word-level tasks such as measuring the magnitude of semantic change and the broadening or narrowing of meaning",

We empirically implement a reward agent, named RewardAgent, that combines human preference rewards with two verifiable signals: factuality and instruction following, to provide more reliable rewards. We conduct comprehensive experiments on existing reward model benchmarks and inference-time best-of-n searches on real-world downstream tasks. RewardAgent significantly outperforms vanilla reward models, demonstrating its effectiveness. We further construct training preference pairs using RewardAgent and train an LLM with the DPO objective, achieving superior performance on various NLP benchmarks compared to conventional reward models.

To overcome these issues, we propose SAKE, a steering activation method that models a fact to be edited as a distribution rather than a single prompt. Leveraging Optimal Transport, SAKE alters the LLM behavior over a whole fact-related distribution, defined as paraphrases and logical implications. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method: SAKE is thus able to perform more robust edits than its existing counterparts",

However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training.

    "title": "Can External Validation Tools Improve Annotation Quality for LLM-as-a-Judge?",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Pairwise preferences over model responses are widely collected to evaluate and provide feedback to large language models (LLMs). Given two alternative model responses to the same input, a human or AI annotator selects the \"better\" response. This approach can provide feedback for domains where other hard-coded metrics are difficult to obtain (e.g., chat response quality), thereby helping model evaluation or training. However, for some domains high-quality pairwise comparisons can be tricky to obtain - from AI and humans. For example, for responses with many factual statements, annotators may disproportionately weigh writing quality rather than underlying facts. In this work, we explore augmenting standard AI annotator systems with additional tools to improve performance on three challenging response domains: long-form factual, math and code tasks. We propose a tool-using agentic system to provide higher quality feedback on these domains. Our system uses web-search and code execution to ground itself based on external validation, independent of the LLM's internal knowledge and biases. We provide extensive experimental results evaluating our method across the three targeted response domains as well as general annotation tasks, using RewardBench (incl. AlpacaEval and LLMBar), RewardMath, as well as three new datasets for domains with saturated pre-existing datasets. Our results indicate that external tools can indeed improve performance in many, but not all, cases. More generally, our experiments highlight the sensitivity of performance to simple parameters (e.g., prompt) and the need for improved (non-saturated) annotator benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a weight token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances, ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models. Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios",

However, previous studies evaluate efficiency robustness under unrealistic assumptions, requiring access to the model architecture and parameters—an impractical scenario in ML-as-a-service settings, where VLMs are deployed via inference APIs. To address this gap, we propose VLMInferSlow, a novel approach for evaluating VLM efficiency robustness in a realistic black-box setting. VLMInferSlow incorporates fine-grained efficiency modeling tailored to VLM inference and leverages zero-order optimization to search for adversarial examples. Experimental results show that VLMInferSlow generates adversarial images with imperceptible perturbations, increasing the computational cost by up to 128.47%.

    "abstract": "The \"LLM-as-an-annotator\" and \"LLM-as-a-judge\" paradigms employ Large Language Models (LLMs) as annotators, judges, and evaluators in tasks traditionally performed by humans. LLM annotations are widely used, not only in NLP research but also in fields like medicine, psychology, and social science. Despite their role in shaping study results and insights, there is no standard or rigorous procedure to determine whether LLMs can replace human annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical procedure, the Alternative Annotator Test (alt-test), that requires only a modest subset of annotated examples to justify using LLM annotations. Additionally, we introduce a versatile and interpretable measure for comparing LLM annotators and judges. To demonstrate our procedure, we curated a diverse collection of ten datasets, consisting of language and vision-language tasks, and conducted experiments with six LLMs and four prompting techniques. Our results show that LLMs can sometimes replace humans with closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4o), outperforming the open-source LLMs we examine, and that prompting techniques yield judges of varying quality.

To address this problem, weak-to-strong generalization aims to elicit the capabilities of strong models through weak supervisors and ensure that the behavior of strong models aligns with the intentions of weak supervisors without unsafe behaviors such as deception. Although weak-to-strong generalization exhibiting certain generalization capabilities, strong models exhibit significant overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization: Due to the strong fit ability of strong models, erroneous labels from weak supervisors may lead to overfitting in strong models. In addition, simply filtering out incorrect labels may lead to a degeneration in question quality, resulting in a weak generalization ability of strong models on hard questions. To mitigate overfitting in weak-to-strong generalization, we propose a two-stage framework that simultaneously improves the quality of supervision signals and the quality of input questions. Experimental results in three series of large language models and two mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly improves PGR (Performance Gap Recovered) compared to naive weak-to-strong generalization, even achieving up to 100% PGR on some models",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have mastered abundant simple and explicit commonsense knowledge through pre-training, enabling them to achieve human-like performance in simple commonsense reasoning. Nevertheless, LLMs struggle to reason with complex and implicit commonsense knowledge that is derived from simple ones (such as understanding the long-term effects of certain events), an aspect humans tend to focus on more. Existing works focus on complex tasks like math and code, while complex commonsense reasoning remains underexplored due to its uncertainty and lack of structure. To fill this gap and align with real-world concerns, we propose a benchmark Com2 focusing on complex commonsense reasoning. We first incorporate causal event graphs to serve as structured complex commonsense. Then we adopt causal theory (e.g., intervention) to modify the causal event graphs and obtain different scenarios that meet human concerns. Finally, an LLM is employed to synthesize examples with slow thinking, which is guided by the logical relationships in the modified causal graphs. Furthermore, we use detective stories to construct a more challenging subset. Experiments show that LLMs struggle in reasoning depth and breadth, while post-training and slow thinking can alleviate this. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Waste-Wood/Com2",

Since (Petroni et al., 2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an \"availability bias\" (Tverski and Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs).As a prototype, we extract a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. Our resource is accessible at https://gptkb.org",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Voice Conversion (VC) aims to transform the source speaker's timbre into an arbitrary unseen one while retaining speech content. Most prior work focuses on preserving the source's prosody, while fine-grained timbre information may leak through prosody, and transferring target prosody to synthesized speech is rarely studied. In light of this, we propose R-VC, a rhythm-controllable and efficient zero-shot voice conversion model. R-VC employs data perturbation techniques and discretize source speech into Hubert content tokens, eliminating much content-irrelevant information. By leveraging a Mask Generative Transformer for in-context duration modeling, our model adapts the linguistic content duration to the desired target speaking style, facilitating the transfer of the target speaker's rhythm. Furthermore, R-VC introduces a powerful Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with shortcut flow matching during training, conditioning the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, enabling high timbre similarity and quality speech generation in fewer sampling steps, even in just two, thus minimizing latency. Experimental results show that R-VC achieves comparable speaker similarity to state-of-the-art VC methods with a smaller dataset, and surpasses them in terms of speech naturalness, intelligibility and style transfer performance",

    "title": "Llama See, Llama Do: A Mechanistic Perspective on Contextual Entrainment and Distraction in LLMs",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "We observe a novel phenomenon, *contextual entrainment*, across a wide range of language models (LMs) and prompt settings, providing a new mechanistic perspective on how LMs become distracted by \"irrelevant\" contextual information in the input prompt. Specifically, LMs assign significantly higher logits (or probabilities) to any tokens that have previously appeared in the context prompt, even for random tokens. This suggests that contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, occurring independently of the relevance or semantic relation of the tokens to the question or the rest of the sentence. We find statistically significant evidence that the magnitude of contextual entrainment is influenced by semantic factors. Counterfactual prompts have a greater effect compared to factual ones, suggesting that while contextual entrainment is a mechanistic phenomenon, it is modulated by semantic factors.We hypothesise that there is a circuit of attention heads — the *entrainment heads* — that corresponds to the contextual entrainment phenomenon. Using a novel entrainment head discovery method based on differentiable masking, we identify these heads across various settings. When we \"turn off\" these heads, i.e., set their outputs to zero, the effect of contextual entrainment is significantly attenuated, causing the model to generate output that capitulates to what it would produce if no distracting context were provided. Our discovery of contextual entrainment, along with our investigation into LM distraction via the entrainment heads, marks a key step towards the mechanistic analysis and mitigation of the distraction problem",

Existing approaches rely on manually designed heuristics, the perplexity of existing models, training classifiers, orcareful prompt engineering, which require significant expert experience and human annotation effort while introduce biases. We introduce CritiQ, a novel data selection method that automatically mines criteria from human preferences for data quality with only ~30 human-annotated pairs and performs efficient data selection. The main component, CritiQ Flow, employs a manager agent to evolve quality criteria and worker agents to make pairwise judgments. We build a knowledge base that extracts quality criteria from previous work to boost CritiQ Flow. Compared to perplexity- and classifier-based methods, verbal criteria are more interpretable and have greater reusable value. After deriving the criteria, we train the CritiQ Scorer to give quality scores and perform efficient data selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the code, math, and logic domains, achieving high accuracy on human-annotated test sets. To validate the quality of the selected data, we continually train Llama 3.2 models and observe improved performance on downstream tasks compared to uniform sampling. Ablation studies validate the benefits of the knowledge base and the reflection process. We analyze how criteria evolve and the effectiveness of majority voting",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs), distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution.In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1% on AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench",

    "title": "Enhancing Cross-Lingual Transfer through Reversible Transliteration: A Huffman-Based Approach for Low-Resource Languages",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly diverse and extensive multilingual corpora, they demonstrate cross-lingual transfer capabilities. However, these capabilities often fail to effectively extend to low-resource languages, particularly those utilizing non-Latin scripts. While transliterating low-resource languages into Latin script presents a natural solution, there currently lacks a comprehensive framework for integrating transliteration into LLMs training and deployment. Taking a pragmatic approach, this paper innovatively combines character transliteration with Huffman coding to design a complete transliteration framework. Our proposed framework offers the following advantages: 1) Compression: Reduces storage requirements for low-resource language content, achieving up to 50% reduction in file size and 50-80% reduction in token count. 2) Accuracy: Guarantees 100% lossless conversion from transliterated text back to the source language. 3) Efficiency: Eliminates the need for vocabulary expansion for low-resource languages, improving training and inference efficiency. 4) Scalability: The framework can be extended to other low-resource languages. We validate the effectiveness of our framework across multiple downstream tasks, including text classification, machine reading comprehension, and machine translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the model's capability to process low-resource languages while maintaining performance on high-resource languages.

Our findings reveal that formality transformations significantly affect bias scores, with informal style showing substantial bias reductions (up to 8.33% in LLaMA-2-13B). We identify appearance bias, sexual orientation bias, and religious bias as most susceptible to style changes, with variations exceeding 20%. Larger models demonstrate greater sensitivity to stylistic variations, with bias measurements fluctuating up to 3.1% more than in smaller models.

In order to understand and later reproduce this dynamic and complex task automatically, we need specialized datasets and tools for analysis, monitoring, and evaluation, such as parallel speech corpora, and tools for their automatic annotation. Existing parallel corpora of translated texts and associated alignment algorithms hardly fill this gap, as they fail to model long-range interactions between speech segments or specific types of divergences (e.g. shortening, simplification, functional generalization) between the original and interpreted speeches. In this work, we develop and explore MockConf, a student interpretation dataset that was collected from Mock Conferences run as part of the students' curriculum. This dataset contains 7 hours of recordings in 5 European languages, transcribed and aligned at the level of spans and words. We further implement and release InterAlign, a modern web-based annotation tool for parallel word and span annotations on long inputs, suitable for aligning simultaneous interpreting.

We introduce the first large-scale benchmark, **LongStoryEval**, comprising 600 newly published books with an average length of 121K tokens (maximum 397K). Each book includes its average rating and multiple reader reviews, presented as critiques organized by evaluation aspects. By analyzing all user-mentioned aspects, we propose an *evaluation criteria structure* and conduct experiments to identify the most significant aspects among the 8 top-level criteria. For evaluation methods, we compare the effectiveness of three types: *aggregation-based*, *incremental-updated*, and *summary-based* evaluations. Our findings reveal that aggregation- and summary-based evaluations perform better, with the former excelling in detail assessment and the latter offering greater efficiency. Building on these insights, we further propose **NovelCritique**, an 8B model that leverages the efficient summary-based framework to review and score stories across specified aspects.

In this work, we present MMBoundary, a novel framework that advances the knowledge boundary awareness of MLLMs through reasoning step confidence calibration. To achieve this, we propose to incorporate complementary textual and cross-modal self-rewarding signals to estimate confidence at each step of the MLLM reasoning process. In addition to supervised fine-tuning MLLM on this set of self-rewarding confidence estimation signal for initial confidence expression warm-up, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage with multiple reward functions for further aligning model knowledge and calibrating confidence at each reasoning step, enhancing reasoning chain self-correction. Empirical results show that MMBoundary significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse domain datasets and metrics, achieving an average of 7.5% reduction in multimodal confidence calibration errors and up to 8.3% improvement in task performance",

This method allows for a comprehensive analysis of model performance and stability from multiple perspectives. We conduct detailed experiments on 20 prominent LLMs across six length intervals.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for consolidating multi-turn adversarial \"jailbreak\" prompts into single-turn queries, significantly reducing the manual overhead required for adversarial testing of large language models (LLMs). While multi-turn human jailbreaks have been shown to yield high attack success rates (ASRs), they demand considerable human effort and time. Our proposed Multi-turn-to-Single-turn (M2S) methods—Hyphenize, Numberize, and Pythonize—systematically reformat multi-turn dialogues into structured single-turn prompts. Despite eliminating iterative back-and-forth interactions, these reformatted prompts preserve and often enhance adversarial potency: in extensive evaluations on the Multi-turn Human Jailbreak (MHJ) dataset, M2S methods yield ASRs ranging from 70.6 % to 95.9 % across various state-of-the-art LLMs. Remarkably, our single-turn prompts outperform the original multi-turn attacks by up to 17.5 % in absolute ASR, while reducing token usage by more than half on average. Further analyses reveal that embedding malicious requests in enumerated or code-like structures exploits \"contextual blindness,\" undermining both native guardrails and external input-output safeguards. By consolidating multi-turn conversations into efficient single-turn prompts, our M2S framework provides a powerful tool for large-scale red-teaming and exposes critical vulnerabilities in contemporary LLM defenses.

In this paper, we propose RAEmoLLM, the first retrieval augmented (RAG) LLMs framework to address cross-domain misinformation detection using in-context learning based on affective information. RAEmoLLM includes three modules. (1) In the index construction module, we apply an emotional LLM to obtain affective embeddings from all domains to construct a retrieval database. (2) The retrieval module uses the database to recommend top K examples (text-label pairs) from source domain data for target domain contents. (3) These examples are adopted as few-shot demonstrations for the inference module to process the target domain content. The RAEmoLLM can effectively enhance the general performance of LLMs in cross-domain misinformation detection tasks through affect-based retrieval, without fine-tuning. We evaluate our framework on three misinformation benchmarks. Results show that RAEmoLLM achieves significant improvements compared to the other few-shot methods on three datasets, with the highest increases of 15.64%, 31.18%, and 15.73% respectively.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Dense video captioning aims to localize events within input videos and generate concise descriptive texts for each event. Advanced end-to-end methods require both tasks to share the same intermediate features that serve as event queries, thereby enabling the mutual promotion of two tasks. However, relying on shared queries limits the model's ability to extract task-specific information, as event semantic perception and localization demand distinct perspectives on video understanding. To address this, we propose a decomposed dense video captioning framework that derives localization and captioning queries from event queries, enabling task-specific representations while maintaining inter-task collaboration. Considering the roles of different queries, we design a contrastive semantic optimization strategy that guides localization queries to focus on event-level visual features and captioning queries to align with textual semantics. Besides, only localization information is considered in existing methods for label assignment, failing to ensure the relevance of the selected queries to descriptions. We jointly consider localization and captioning losses to achieve a semantically balanced assignment process. Extensive experiments on the YouCook2 and ActivityNet Captions datasets demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance",

    "title": "CalibraEval: Calibrating Prediction Distribution to Mitigate Selection Bias in LLMs-as-Judges",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The use of large language models (LLMs) as automated evaluation tools to assess the quality of generated natural language, known as \"LLMs-as-Judges\", has demonstrated promising capabilities and is rapidly gaining widespread attention. However, when applied to pairwise comparisons of candidate responses, LLM-based evaluators often exhibit selection bias. Specifically, their judgments may become inconsistent when the option positions or ID tokens are swapped, compromising the effectiveness and fairness of the evaluation result. To address this challenge, we introduce CalibraEval, a novel label-free method for mitigating selection bias during inference. Specifically, CalibraEval reformulates debiasing as an optimization task aimed at adjusting observed prediction distributions to align with unbiased prediction distributions. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a non-parametric order-preserving algorithm (NOA). This algorithm leverages the partial order relationships between model prediction distributions, thereby eliminating the need for explicit labels and precise mathematical function modeling. Empirical evaluations of LLMs in multiple representative benchmarks demonstrate that CalibraEval effectively mitigates selection bias and improves performance compared to existing debiasing methods. This work marks a step toward building more robust and unbiased automated evaluation frameworks, paving the way for improved reliability in AI-driven assessments.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The detection of sexism in online content remains an open problem, as harmful language disproportionately affects women and marginalized groups. While automated systems for sexism detection have been developed, they still face two key challenges: data sparsity and the nuanced nature of sexist language. Even in large, well-curated datasets like the Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS), severe class imbalance hinders model generalization. Additionally, the overlapping and ambiguous boundaries of fine-grained categories introduce substantial annotator disagreement, reflecting the difficulty of interpreting nuanced expressions of sexism. To address these challenges, we propose two prompt-based data augmentation techniques: Definition-based Data Augmentation (DDA), which leverages category-specific definitions to generate semantically-aligned synthetic examples, and Contextual Semantic Expansion (CSE), which targets systematic model errors by enriching examples with task-specific semantic features. To further improve reliability in fine-grained classification, we introduce an ensemble strategy that resolves prediction ties by aggregating complementary perspectives from multiple language models. Our experimental evaluation on the EDOS dataset demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, with notable improvements of macro F1 by 1.5 points for binary classification (Task A) and 4.1 points for fine-grained classification (Task C)",

While attacks against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the privacy attacks to zero",

We discover Temporal Heads, specific attention heads that primarily handle temporal knowledge, through circuit analysis.

Disabling these heads degrades the model's ability to recall time-specific knowledge while maintaining its general capabilities without compromising time-invariant and question-answering performances. Moreover, the heads are activated not only numeric conditions (\"In 2004\") but also textual aliases (\"In the year ...\"), indicating that they encode a temporal dimension beyond simple numerical representation. Furthermore, we expand the potential of our findings by demonstrating how temporal knowledge can be edited by adjusting the values of these heads",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that a diverse corpus is critical for training large language models, which are typically constructed from a mixture of various domains. In general, previous efforts resort to either sampling training data from different domains with static proportions or dynamically adjusting these proportions during training to optimise pretraining performance. However, few methods addressed the complexities of domain-adaptive continual pre-training. To fill this gap, we propose Velocitune, a novel framework that dynamically assesses learning velocity and adjusts data proportions accordingly, favouring slower learning domains while de-emphasising faster learning ones, which is guided by a scaling law to estimate the desired learning goal for each domain with a less associated cost. To evaluate the effectiveness of Velocitune, we conduct experiments on a dataset focused on reasoning tasks with CodeLlama, as well as on a corpus of system commands using Llama3 and Mistral. Velocitune achieves performance gains in both math and code reasoning tasks and command-line generation benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that key factors driving Velocitune's effectiveness include target estimation and data ordering",

This study identifies the limitations of LLMs in detecting implicit hate speech, particularly when disguised as seemingly harmless expressions in a rhetorical device. To address this challenge, we employ a Jailbreaking strategy and Energy-based Constrained Decoding techniques, and design a small model for measuring the energy of metaphorical rhetoric. This approach can lead to LLMs generating metaphorical implicit hate speech. Our research reveals that advanced LLMs, like GPT-4o, frequently misinterpret metaphorical implicit hate speech, and fail to prevent its propagation effectively. Even specialized models, like ShieldGemma and LlamaGuard, demonstrate inadequacies in blocking such content, often misclassifying it as harmless speech.

Existing model editing methods, especially those that alter model parameters, typically focus on single-round editing and often face significant challenges in sequential model editing-most notably issues of model forgetting and failure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new model editing method, namely Neuron-level Sequential Editing (NSE), tailored for supporting sequential model editing. Specifically, we optimize the target layer's hidden states using the model's original weights to prevent model failure. Furthermore, we iteratively select neurons in multiple layers for editing based on their activation values to mitigate model forgetting. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that NSE significantly outperforms current modifying parameters model editing methods, marking a substantial advancement in the field of sequential model editing.

While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is pre-pended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency",

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an effective solution by incorporating external knowledge, but existing methods still face several limitations: additional deployment costs of separate retrievers, redundant input tokens from retrieved text chunks, and the lack of joint optimization of retrieval and generation. To address these issues, we propose RetroLLM, a unified framework that integrates retrieval and generation into a single, auto-regressive process, enabling LLMs to directly generate fine-grained evidence from the corpus with constrained decoding. Moreover, to mitigate false pruning in the process of constrained evidence generation, we introduce (1) hierarchical FM-Index constraints, which generate corpus-constrained clues to identify a subset of relevant documents before evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding space; and (2) a forward-looking constrained decoding strategy, which considers the relevance of future sequences to improve evidence accuracy.

    "abstract": "Large language models enhance collaborative task execution in multi-agent systems. Current studies break complex task into manageable tasks, but agents lack understanding of the overall task and how others approach their tasks, hindering synergy and integration.We propose a method called knowledgeable Agents to design and perform Complex Tasks (ACT), where: (1) Agents independently manage their knowledge and tasks while collaboratively design the complex task into a more comprehensible form. In parallel, each agent also acquires knowledge of others, defined as a structured description of how other agents approach their tasks based on the agent's own task resolution. (2) Each agent updates its knowledge and refines its task through interactions with others. By referencing structured knowledge, they effectively integrate their tasks to collaboratively solve the complex task.Three evaluations including creative writing and tool utilization, show that ACT accurately outperforms existing methods in solving complex tasks",

Existing length control methods involve fine-tuning the parameters of LLMs, which is inefficient and suboptimal for practical use. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative sampling framework for text length control, integrating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with an importance sampling acceleration strategy. This framework efficiently and reliably regulates LLMs to generate length-constrained text without modifying the underlying parameters, thereby preserving the original capabilities of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves almost 100% success rates of length control on Llama3.1 for tasks such as length-controlled abstractive summarization and length-constrained instruction following, with minimal additional computational overhead. This also highlights the significant potential of our method for precise length control across a broader range of applications, without compromising the versatility of LLMs",

Leveraging this insight, we propose RHIO, a framework designed to teach LLMs to explicitly discriminate between faithful and unfaithful generations. RHIO first augments unfaithful samples that simulate realistic model-intrinsic errors by selectively masking retrieval heads. Then, these samples are incorporated into joint training, enabling the model to distinguish unfaithful outputs from faithful ones conditioned on control tokens. Furthermore, these control tokens are leveraged to self-induce contrastive outputs, amplifying their difference through contrastive decoding. Additionally, to facilitate the evaluation of contextual faithfulness, we also introduce GroundBench, a comprehensive benchmark compiled from five existing LFQA datasets.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "An extensive high-quality instruction dataset is crucial for the instruction tuning process of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent instruction expansion methods have demonstrated their capability to improve the quality and quantity of existing datasets, by prompting high-performance LLM to generate multiple new instructions from the original ones. However, existing methods focus on constructing multi-perspective prompts (e.g., increasing complexity or difficulty) to expand instructions, overlooking the \"Fixed Thinking Pattern\" issue of LLMs. This issue arises when repeatedly using the same set of prompts, causing LLMs to rely on a limited set of certain expressions to expand all instructions, potentially compromising the diversity of the final expanded dataset. This paper theoretically analyzes the causes of the \"Fixed Thinking Pattern\", and corroborates this phenomenon through multi-faceted empirical research. Furthermore, we propose a novel method based on dynamic prompt updating: Global Eye. Specifically, after a fixed number of instruction expansions, we analyze the statistical characteristics of newly generated instructions and then update the prompts. Experimental results show that our method enables Llama3-8B and Llama2-13B to surpass the performance of open-source LLMs and GPT3.5 across various metrics.

    "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) accounts for a significant portion of LLM usage in the wild\". However, LLMs sometimes produce false or misleading responses, also known as hallucinations\". Therefore, grounding the generated answers in contextually provided information—i.e., providing evidence for the generated text—is paramount for LLMs' trustworthiness. Providing this information is the task of context attribution. In this paper, we systematically study LLM-based approaches for this task, namely we investigate (i) zero-shot inference, (ii) LLM ensembling, and (iii) fine-tuning of small LMs on synthetic data generated by larger LLMs. Our key contribution is SynQA: a novel generative strategy for synthesizing context attribution data. Given selected context sentences, an LLM generates QA pairs that are supported by these sentences. This leverages LLMs' natural strengths in text generation while ensuring clear attribution paths in the synthetic training data. We show that the attribution data synthesized via SynQA is highly effective for fine-tuning small LMs for context attribution in different QA tasks and domains. Finally, with a user study, we validate the usefulness of small LMs (fine-tuned on synthetic data from SynQA) in context attribution for QA",

    "abstract": "As a bridge between natural texts and information systems like structured storage, statistical analysis, retrieving, and recommendation, the text-to-table task has received widespread attention recently. Existing researches have gone through a paradigm shift from traditional bottom-up IE (Information Extraction) to top-down LLMs-based question answering with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Furthermore, these methods mainly adopt end-to-end models or use multi-stage pipelines to extract text content based on static table structures. However, they neglect to deal with precise inner-document evidence extraction and dynamic information such as multiple entities and events, which can not be defined in static table head format and are very common in natural texts.To address this issue, we propose a two-stage dynamic content extraction agent framework called TST (Text-Schema-Table), which uses type recognition methods to extract context evidences with the conduction of domain schema sequentially. Based on the evidence, firstly we quantify the total instances of each dynamic object and then extract them with ordered numerical prompts. Through extensive comparisons with existing methods across different datasets, our extraction framework exhibits state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

    "abstract": "LLMs' performance on complex tasks is still unsatisfactory. A key issue is that presently LLMs learn in a data-driven schema, while the instructions about these complex tasks are both scarce and hard to collect or construct. On the contrary, a prominent phenomenon is that LLMs can learn rather fast on simpler tasks with adequate prior knowledge captured during pretraining stage. Thus, if the prerequisite and mechanism of such rapid generalization could be elucidated, it could enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the LLM's ability to learn complex tasks. Thus, in this paper, we employ a gradient-based method, to dissect the process that the SFT process adapts LLMs to downstream tasks via the perspective of attention patterns. We find that: (1) LLMs selectively activate task-specific attention heads during SFT; (2) activation patterns for complex tasks are combinations of basic task patterns; and (3) changes in a few parameters can significantly impact activation patterns after SFT on a small number of samples.Based on these insights, experiments are conducted to actually enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of SFT",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe—a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1,500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models' abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness—prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning—but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area.

Our dataset enables more detailed trip itinerary generation (including duration spent at each point of interest based on users' persona, transit between two points of interest, etc.) while ensuring spatio-temporal consistency. Further, we propose novel evaluation metrics (temporal meal score, attraction score, spatial score, ordering score, and persona score) to assess LLM-generated plans across temporal, spatial, sequential, and personal dimensions, overcoming the limitations of commonsense and hard constraint metrics. Interestingly, our parameter-informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving performance from 61% to 80% in the 7-day scenario- as quantified by a 19% gain in our temporal meal score.

This paper introduces DualGuard, a bidirectional defense mechanism against DRAs for split-based LLM-FT. DualGuard proposes a local warm-up parameter space transformation to alter client-side model parameters before training, using multi-task learning to strike a balance between privacy protection and model performance. Additionally, a global fine-tuning parameter space retention strategy prevents the model from reverting to vulnerable states during formal fine-tuning. Experiments show that DualGuard outperforms current defense methods against various DRAs, while maintaining task performance. Our code will be made publicly available",

However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data",

To systematically investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce ConfuseBench, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach",

    "title": "Decoding by Contrasting Knowledge: Enhancing Large Language Model Confidence on Edited Facts",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The knowledge within large language models (LLMs) may become outdated quickly. While in-context editing (ICE) is currently the most effective method for knowledge editing (KE), it is constrained by the black-box modeling of LLMs and thus lacks interpretability. Our work aims to elucidate the superior performance of ICE in KE by analyzing the impacts of in-context new knowledge on token-wise distributions. We observe that despite a significant boost in logits of the new knowledge, the performance of ICE is still hindered by stubborn knowledge. We propose a novel approach termed Decoding by Contrasting Knowledge (DeCK). DeCK derives the distribution of the next token by contrasting the logits obtained from the newly edited knowledge guided by ICE with those from the unedited parametric knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate that DeCK enhances the confidence of LLMs in edited facts. For instance, it improves the performance of LLaMA3-8B-instruct on MQuAKE by up to 219%, demonstrating its capability to strengthen ICE. DeCK can be easily integrated into any ICE method as a decoding component to enhance editing capabilities",

In this work, we introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising 509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos, making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations. Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets, ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset",

    "title": "Improving Chain-of-Thought Reasoning via Quasi-Symbolic Abstractions",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Chain-of-Though (CoT) represents a common strategy for reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into intermediate inference steps. However, explanations generated via CoT are susceptible to content biases that negatively affect their robustness and faithfulness. To mitigate existing limitations, recent work has proposed using logical formalisms coupled with external symbolic solvers. However, fully symbolic approaches possess the bottleneck of requiring a complete translation from natural language to formal languages, a process that affects efficiency and flexibility. To achieve a trade-off, this paper investigates methods to disentangle content from logical reasoning without a complete formalisation. In particular, we present QuaSAR (for Quasi-Symbolic Abstract Reasoning), a variation of CoT that guides LLMs to operate at a higher level of abstraction via quasi-symbolic explanations. Our framework leverages the capability of LLMs to formalise only relevant variables and predicates, enabling the coexistence of symbolic elements with natural language. We show the impact of QuaSAR for in-context learning and for constructing demonstrations to improve the reasoning capabilities of smaller models. Our experiments show that quasi-symbolic abstractions can improve CoT-based methods by up to 8% accuracy, enhancing robustness and consistency on challenging adversarial variations on both natural language (i.e. MMLU-Redux) and symbolic reasoning tasks (i.e., GSM-Symbolic)",

    "abstract": "Information extraction (IE) from Visually Rich Documents (VRDs) containing layout features along with text is a critical and well-studied task. Specialized non-LLM NLP-based solutions typically involve training models using both textual and geometric information to label sequences/tokens as named entities or answers to specific questions. However, these approaches lack reasoning, are not able to infer values not explicitly present in documents, and do not generalize well to new formats. Generative LLMs-based approaches proposed recently are capable of reasoning, but struggle to comprehend clues from document layout especially in previously unseen document formats, and do not show competitive performance in heterogeneous VRD benchmark datasets. In this paper, we propose BLOCKIE, a novel LLM-based approach that organizes VRDs into localized, reusable semantic textual segments called semantic blocks, which are processed independently. Through focused and more generalizable reasoning,our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public VRD benchmarks by 1-3% in F1 scores, is resilient to document formats previously not encountered and shows abilities to correctly extract information not explicitly present in documents",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in traditional natural language processing tasks but struggle with problems that require complex domain-specific calculations or simulations. While equipping LLMs with external tools to build LLM-based agents can enhance their capabilities, existing approaches lack the flexibility to address diverse and ever-evolving user queries in open domains. Currently, there is also no existing dataset that evaluates LLMs on open-domain knowledge that requires tools to solve. To this end, we introduce OpenAct benchmark to evaluate the open-domain task-solving capability, which is built on human expert consultation and repositories in GitHub. It comprises 339 questions spanning 7 diverse domains that need to be solved with domain-specific methods. In our experiments, even state-of-the-art LLMs and LLM-based agents demonstrate unsatisfactory success rates, underscoring the need for a novel approach.Furthermore, we present OpenAgent, a novel LLM-based agent system that can tackle evolving queries in open domains through autonomously integrating specialized tools from GitHub. OpenAgent employs 1) a hierarchical framework where specialized agents handle specific tasks and can assign tasks to inferior agents, 2) a bi-level experience learning mechanism to learn from both humans' and its own experiences to tackle tool flaws.

    "abstract": "Training medical personnel using standardized patients (SPs) remains a complex challenge, requiring extensive domain expertise and role-specific practice. Most research on Large Language Model (LLM)-based simulated patients focuses on improving data retrieval accuracy or adjusting prompts through human feedback. However, this focus has overlooked the critical need for patient agents to learn a standardized presentation pattern that transforms data into human-like patient responses through unsupervised simulations. To address this gap, we propose EvoPatient, a novel simulated patient framework in which a patient agent and doctor agents simulate the diagnostic process through multi-turn dialogues, simultaneously gathering experience to improve the quality of both questions and answers, ultimately enabling human doctor training. Extensive experiments on various cases demonstrate that, by providing only overall SP requirements, our framework improves over existing reasoning methods by more than 10% in requirement alignment and better human preference, while achieving an optimal balance of resource consumption after evolving over 200 cases for 10 hours, with excellent generalizability.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the real world, or create content fitting particu- lar labels during the study. Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several dimen- sions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require genuine data",

    "abstract": "Demographics and cultural background of annotators influence the labels they assign in text annotation – for instance, an elderly woman might find it offensive to read a message addressed to a \"bro\", but a male teenager might find it appropriate. It is therefore important to acknowledge label variations to not under-represent members of a society. Two research directions developed out of this observation in the context of using large language models (LLM) for data annotations, namely (1) studying biases and inherent knowledge of LLMs and (2) injecting diversity in the output by manipulating the prompt with demographic information. We combine these two strands of research and ask the question to which demographics an LLM resorts to when no demographics is given. To answer this question, we evaluate which attributes of human annotators LLMs inherently mimic. Furthermore, we compare non-demographic conditioned prompts and placebo-conditioned prompts (e.g., \"you are an annotator who lives in house number 5\") to demographics-conditioned prompts (\"You are a 45 year old man and an expert on politeness annotation. How do you rate instance\"). We study these questions for politeness and offensiveness annotations on the POPQUORN data set, a corpus created in a controlled manner to investigate human label variations based on demographics which has not been used for LLM-based analyses so far. We observe notable influences related to gender, race, and age in demographic prompting, which contrasts with previous studies that found no such effects",

Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs.

To bridge this gap, we conduct a bottom-up decomposition of LCTG sub-abilities with human patterns as reference and perform a detailed error analysis. On this basis, we propose MarkerGen, a simple-yet-effective plug-and-play approach that: (1) mitigates LLM fundamental deficiencies via external tool integration; (2) conducts explicit length modeling with dynamically inserted markers; (3) employs a three-stage generation scheme to better align length constraints while maintaining content quality.

Existing defenses, including post-training alignment and prompt engineering, rely on training on safety-annotated datasets and safe prompt templates, struggling with adaptability to out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Steering internal representations of LLMs provides real-time adjustments to defend against OOD attacks. However, it struggles with maintaining model utility, since modifying the representation disrupts the forward pass of inference. It barely considers the competitive objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness in LLMs. We argue that adversarial game-based approaches promise a solution for conflicts between the two objectives. In this paper, we propose **A**dversarial **G**ame **D**efense (AGD), an adversarial game-based defense method that dynamically adjusts LLMs' internal representations to achieve a balanced trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness. AGD first proposes an interquartile range (IQR) method to detect abnormal attention weights and correct the abnormal weights via adversarial training. AGD adopts a bi-level optimization to play a two-player variable-sum game to approach Nash Equilibrium (NE), where the two players adversarially refine head activations for helpfulness and harmlessness respectively. Furthermore, AGD applies an expert model to next-token sampling to generate safer responses. Experiments show that AGD significantly improves LLMs' safety over all baselines",

    "abstract": "Despite the great potential of large language models (LLMs) in machine comprehension, it is still disturbing to fully count on them in real-world scenarios. This is probably because there is no rational explanation for whether the comprehension process of LLMs is aligned with that of experts. In this paper, we propose SCOP to carefully examine how LLMs perform during the comprehension process from a cognitive view. Specifically, it is equipped with a systematical definition of five requisite skills during the comprehension process, a strict framework to construct testing data for these skills, and a detailed analysis of advanced open-sourced and closed-sourced LLMs using the testing data. With SCOP, we find that it is still challenging for LLMs to perform an expert-level comprehension process. Even so, we notice that LLMs share some similarities with experts, e.g., performing better at comprehending local information than global information. Further analysis reveals that LLMs can be somewhat unreliable — they might reach correct answers through flawed comprehension processes. Based on SCOP, we suggest that one direction for improving LLMs is to focus more on the comprehension process, ensuring all comprehension skills are thoroughly developed during training",

To address these issues, we propose Table-Critic, a novel multi-agent framework that facilitates collaborative criticism and iterative refinement of the reasoning process until convergence to correct solutions. Our framework consists of four specialized agents: a Judge for error identification, a Critic for comprehensive critiques, a Refiner for process improvement, and a Curator for pattern distillation. To effectively deal with diverse and unpredictable error types, we introduce a self-evolving template tree that systematically accumulates critique knowledge through experience-driven learning and guides future reflections.

To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., \"nutrition fact labels\"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) advance, multimodal agents show promise in real-world tasks like web navigation and embodied intelligence. However, due to limitations in a lack of external feedback, these agents struggle with self-correction and generalization. A promising approach is to use reward models as external feedback, but there is no clear on how to select reward models for agents. Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench targeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The benchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and real-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and safety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation. It allows for the assessment of agent capabilities at the individual steps of a task, providing a more granular view of performance during the planning process; and (3) Appropriately difficulty and high-quality. We carefully sample from 10 diverse models, difficulty control to maintain task challenges, and manual verification to ensure the integrity of the data. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models show limited performance, highlighting the need for specialized training in agent reward modeling. Code is available at github",

    "abstract": "With the development of large language models, they are widely used as agents in various fields. A key component of agents is memory, which stores vital information but is susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing research mainly focuses on single-agent attacks and shared memory attacks. However, real-world scenarios often involve independent memory. In this paper, we propose the Troublemaker Makes Chaos in Honest Town (TMCHT) task, a large-scale, multi-agent, multi-topology text-based attack evaluation framework. TMCHT involves one attacker agent attempting to mislead an entire society of agents. We identify two major challenges in multi-agent attacks: (1) Non-complete graph structure, (2) Large-scale systems. We attribute these challenges to a phenomenon we term toxicity disappearing. To address these issues, we propose an Adversarial Replication Contagious Jailbreak (ARCJ) method, which optimizes the retrieval suffix to make poisoned samples more easily retrieved and optimizes the replication suffix to make poisoned samples have contagious ability. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach in TMCHT, with 23.51%, 18.95%, and 52.93% improvements in line, star topologies, and 100-agent settings.

Meta-learning has been proposed as a way to integrate human-like learning biases into neural-network architectures, combining both the structured generalizations of symbolic models with the scalability of neural-network models. But what does meta-learning exactly imbue the model with? We investigate the meta-learning of formal languages and find that, contrary to previous claims, meta-trained models are not learning simplicity-based priors when meta-trained on datasets organised around simplicity. Rather, we find evidence that meta-training imprints neural mechanisms (such as counters) into the model, which function like cognitive primitives for the network on downstream tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that meta-training on a *single* formal language can provide as much improvement to a model as meta-training on 5000 different formal languages, provided that the formal language incentivizes the learning of useful neural mechanisms. Taken together, our findings provide practical implications for efficient meta-learning paradigms and new theoretical insights into linking symbolic theories and neural mechanisms",

We evaluate popular models such as LLaMA-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 across gender, racial, and religious bias types. Our findings reveal that models are generally more susceptible to gender bias attacks compared to racial or religious biases. We also explore novel aspects such as cross-bias and multiple-bias attacks, finding varying degrees of transferability across bias types. Additionally, our results show that larger models and pretrained base models often exhibit higher susceptibility to bias attacks. These insights contribute to the development of more inclusive and ethically responsible LLMs, emphasizing the importance of understanding and mitigating potential bias vulnerabilities.

Such systems cannot reason at the pixel level and comprehend dynamic user intent that changes over interaction. Our work tackles this issue by introducing a novel task, Pixel-level Reasoning Segmentation (Pixel-level RS) based on multi-turn conversations, tracking evolving user intent via multi-turn interactions for fine-grained segmentation. To establish a benchmark for this novel task, we build a Pixel-level ReasonIng Segmentation Dataset Based on Multi-Turn Conversations (PRIST), comprising 24k utterances from 8.3k multi-turn conversational scenarios with segmentation targets. Building on PRIST, we further propose MIRAS, a Multi-turn Interactive ReAsoning Segmentation framework, integrates pixel-level segmentation with robust multi-turn conversation understanding, generating pixel-grounded explanations aligned with user intent. The PRIST dataset and MIRSA framework fill the gap in pixel-level reasoning segmentation. Experimental results on the PRIST dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current segmentation-specific baselines in terms of segmentation and LLM-based reasoning metrics.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Self-critique mechanisms significantly improve the performance of language models in complex reasoning tasks by giving them the ability to correct errors, conduct induction and deduction, and switch thinking insights. However, synthetic data methods often require human-introduced errors or sampling of the model's reasoning results from the previous moment, and the current output distribution of the model cannot be obtained, makes the data for critique and reasoning face the problem of distribution shifts. In this work, we propose an on-policy reinforcement learning framework to synchronize the reasoning and critique capabilities of language models. To alleviate reward hacking caused by outcome-based supervision, we design a deliberate reward framework for different purposes. The reward framework not only supervises the model reasoning process based on the results, but also uses Monte Carlo sampling to give appropriate rewards to the critique content according to the success rate of the model's correction after critique. In addition, we introduce a rule-based reward function to impose penalties on the model when it generates hallucinatory critiques. When our approach is applied to the DeepSeek-Math-7B-Base and Qwen2.5-7B-Base models, model performance improves 5.40 and 3.66 points, respectively, compared to the best baseline approach. This validates the significant advantages of our method in improving model's reasoning and self-critique capability. Code will be made available at https://github.com/rbao2018/SCOP",

Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work, we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head's outputs during inference and are causally linked to the model's predictions. Moreover, its mappings reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment, while revealing diverse operations",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2) efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations, (3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover, we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations required for successful verification",

Despite the fact that many existing knowledge editing algorithms achieve near-perfect performance on conventional metrics, the models edited by them are still prone to generating original knowledge. This paper introduces the concept of \"**superficial editing**\" to describe this phenomenon. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that this issue presents a significant challenge to existing algorithms. Through systematic investigation, we identify and validate two key factors contributing to this issue: (1) the residual stream at the last subject position in earlier layers and (2) specific attention modules in later layers. Notably, certain attention heads in later layers, along with specific left singular vectors in their output matrices, encapsulate the original knowledge and exhibit a causal relationship with superficial editing. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the task of superficial unlearning, where we observe consistent patterns in the behavior of specific attention heads and their corresponding left singular vectors, thereby demonstrating the robustness and broader applicability of our methodology and conclusions.

    "abstract": "Multi-hop Question Answering (MHQA) adds layers of complexity to question answering, making it more challenging. When Language Models (LMs) are prompted with multiple search results, they are tasked not only with retrieving relevant information but also employing multi-hop reasoning across the information sources. Although LMs perform well on traditional question-answering tasks, the causal mask can hinder their capacity to reason across complex contexts. In this paper, we explore how LMs respond to multi-hop questions by permuting search results (retrieved documents) under various configurations. Our study reveals interesting findings as follows: 1) Encoder-decoder models, such as the ones in the Flan-T5 family, generally outperform causal decoder-only LMs in MHQA tasks, despite being significantly smaller in size; 2) altering the order of gold documents reveals distinct trends in both Flan T5 models and fine-tuned decoder-only models, with optimal performance observed when the document order aligns with the reasoning chain order; 3) enhancing causal decoder-only models with bi-directional attention by modifying the causal mask can effectively boost their end performance. In addition to the above, we conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution of LM attention weights in the context of MHQA. Our experiments reveal that attention weights tend to peak at higher values when the resulting answer is correct. We leverage this finding to heuristically improve LMs' performance on this task.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The modeling of industrial scenes is essential for simulations in industrial manufacturing. While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o.

    "abstract": "Tool learning has emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks through interaction with external tools. Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning",

    "abstract": "Text editing frames grammatical error correction (GEC) as a sequence tagging problem, where edit tags are assigned to input tokens, and applying these edits results in the corrected text. This approach has gained attention for its efficiency and interpretability. However, while extensively explored for English, text editing remains largely underexplored for morphologically rich languages like Arabic. In this paper, we introduce a text editing approach that derives edit tags directly from data, eliminating the need for language-specific edits. We demonstrate its effectiveness on Arabic, a diglossic and morphologically rich language, and investigate the impact of different edit representations on model performance. Our approach achieves SOTA results on two Arabic GEC benchmarks and performs on par with SOTA on two others. Additionally, our models are over six times faster than existing Arabic GEC systems, making our approach more practical for real-world applications. Finally, we explore ensemble models, demonstrating how combining different models leads to further performance improvements. We make our code, data, and pretrained models publicly available",

Large-scale standardized collections of multilingual wordlists and grammatical language structures might help to improve this and open new avenues for developing automated language affiliation workflows. Here, we present neural network models that use lexical and grammatical data from a worldwide sample of more than 1,200 languages with known affiliations to classify individual languages into families. In line with the traditional assumption of most linguists, our results show that models trained on lexical data alone outperform models solely based on grammatical data, whereas combining both types of data yields even better performance. In additional experiments, we show how our models can identify long-ranging relations between entire subgroups, how they can be employed to investigate potential relatives of linguistic isolates, and how they can help us to obtain first hints on the affiliation of so far unaffiliated languages. We conclude that models for automated language affiliation trained on lexical and grammatical data provide comparative linguists with a valuable tool for evaluating hypotheses about deep and unknown language relations",

    "abstract": "Generative large language models are crucial in natural language processing, but they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where subtle triggers compromise their behavior. Although backdoor attacks against LLMs are constantly emerging, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of sufficient coverage of attack, metric system integrity, backdoor attack alignment. And existing pre-trained backdoor attacks are idealized in practice due to resource access constraints. Therefore we establish ELBA-Bench, a comprehensive and unified framework that allows attackers to inject backdoor through parameter efficient fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) or without fine-tuning techniques (e.g., In-context-learning). ELBA-Bench provides over 1300 experiments encompassing the implementations of 12 attack methods, 18 datasets, and 12 LLMs. Extensive experiments provide new invaluable findings into the strengths and limitations of various attack strategies. For instance, PEFT attack consistently outperform without fine-tuning approaches in classification tasks while showing strong cross-dataset generalization with optimized triggers boosting robustness; Task-relevant backdoor optimization techniques or attack prompts along with clean and adversarial demonstrations can enhance backdoor attack success while preserving model performance on clean samples. Additionally, we introduce a universal toolbox designed for standardized backdoor attack research at https://github.com/NWPUliuxx/ELBA_Bench, with the goal of propelling further progress in this vital area",

We evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing information about interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite.

We empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in code generation, yet they still face challenges when tackling tasks that extend beyond their basic capabilities. Recently, the concept of self-debugging has been proposed as a way to enhance code generation performance by leveraging execution feedback from tests. However, the availability of high-quality tests in real-world scenarios is often limited. In this context, self-debugging with self-generated tests emerges as a promising solution, though its limitations and practical potential have not been fully explored. To address this gap, we investigate the efficacy of self-debugging in code generation tasks. We propose and analyze two distinct paradigms for the self-debugging process: post-execution and in-execution self-debugging. Our findings reveal that post-execution self-debugging struggles with the test bias introduced by self-generated tests, which can lead to misleading feedback. In contrast, in-execution self-debugging enables LLMs to mitigate this bias and leverage intermediate states during program execution. By focusing on runtime information rather than relying solely on potentially flawed self-generated tests, this approach demonstrates significant promise for improving the robustness and accuracy of LLMs in code generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed model InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks",

To integrate gestures into language models, we first encode 3D human motion sequences into discrete gesture tokens using a VQ-VAE. These gesture token embeddings are then aligned with text embeddings through feature alignment, mapping them into the text embedding space. To evaluate the gesture-aligned language model on spoken discourse, we construct text infilling tasks targeting three key discourse cues grounded in linguistic research: discourse connectives, stance markers, and quantifiers. Results show that incorporating gestures enhances marker prediction accuracy across the three tasks, highlighting the complementary information that gestures can offer in modeling spoken discourse.

However, it is hard to determine how to bring various high-dimensional semantic constraints, and how to integrate each constraint across all hops when a multi-hop question is being generating. To address these challenges, we introduce an effective framework which includes constraint dimensionality reduction and divide-and-conquer-based dynamic projection; we call it RUBY. The proposed RUBY contains a module of high-dimensional semantic constraint dimension reduction and a module of sub-question answer pairs-based multi-hop question generation. Meanwhile, a Reasoning Dynamic Projection strategy is tailored to effectively incorporate the constraints into every hop of the multi-hop question.

    "title": "Can Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks Be Detected and Removed?",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Prompt injection attacks manipulate large language models (LLMs) by misleading them to deviate from the original input instructions and execute maliciously injected instructions, because of their instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between the original input instructions and maliciously injected instructions. To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection.In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the *segmentation removal method*, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the *extraction removal method*, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Automatic language identification is a core problem of many Natural LanguageProcessing (NLP) pipelines. A wide variety of architectures and benchmarks havebeen proposed with often near-perfect performance. Although previousstudies have focused on certain challenging setups (i.e. cross-domain, shortinputs), a systematic comparison is missing. We propose a benchmark that allows us to test for the effect of input size, training data size, domain, number oflanguages, scripts, and language families on performance. We evaluatefive popular models on this benchmark and identify which open challengesremain for this task as well as which architectures achieve robust performance. Wefind that cross-domain setups are the most challenging (although arguably mostrelevant), and that number of languages, variety in scripts, and variety inlanguage families have only a small impact on performance. We also contributepractical takeaways: training with 1,000 instances per language and a maximuminput length of 100 characters is enough for robust language identification.Based on our findings, we train an accurate (94.41%) multi-domain languageidentification model on 2,034 languages, for which we also provide an analysisof the remaining errors",

    "abstract": "A well-known issue with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is that retrieved passages that are irrelevant to the query sometimes distract the answer-generating LLM, causing it to provide an incorrect response. In this paper, we shed light on this core issue and formulate the distracting effect of a passage w.r.t. a query (and an LLM). We provide a quantifiable measure of the distracting effect of a passage and demonstrate its robustness across LLMs. Our research introduces novel methods for identifying and using hard distracting passages to improve RAG systems. By fine-tuning LLMs with these carefully selected distracting passages, we achieve up to a 7.5% increase in answering accuracy compared to counterparts fine-tuned on conventional RAG datasets. Our contribution is two-fold: first, we move beyond the simple binary classification of irrelevant passages as either completely unrelated vs. distracting, and second, we develop and analyze multiple methods for finding hard distracting passages. To our knowledge, no other research has provided such a comprehensive framework for identifying and utilizing hard distracting passages",

This situation is exacerbated by the fact that modern LLMs such as LLaMA and Qwen support far fewer languages than XLM-R, making text generation models non-existent for many languages in the world. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework for adapting multilingual encoders to text generation in extremely low-resource languages. By reusing the weights between the encoder and the decoder, our framework allows the model to leverage the learned semantic space of the encoder, enabling efficient learning and effective generalization in low-resource languages. Applying this framework to four Chinese minority languages, we present XLM-SWCM, and demonstrate its superior performance on various downstream tasks even when compared with much larger models",

Traditional Abusive Language Detection (ALD) models often overlook this context, which can lead to unreliable performance metrics. Recent Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches that incorporate conversational context often rely on limited or overly simplified representations of this context, leading to inconsistent and sometimes inconclusive results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model social media conversations as graphs, where nodes represent comments, and edges capture reply structures. We systematically investigate various graph representations and context windows to identify the optimal configurations for ALD. Our GNN model outperforms both context-agnostic baselines and linear context-aware methods, achieving significant improvements in F1 scores. These findings demonstrate the critical role of structured conversational context and establish GNNs as a robust framework for advancing context-aware ALD",

CodeTool incorporates two distinct process rewards: the On-the-spot Reward, which provides immediate feedback on the accuracy of each tool invocation, and the Latent Reward, which assesses the contribution of each step toward overall task completion. By maximizing the cumulative reward of the On-the-spot and Latend Rewards at each step, LLMs are guided to follow efficient and accurate reasoning paths.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of technology, large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, powering LLM-integrated applications like Microsoft Copilot. However, as LLMs continue to evolve, new vulnerabilities, especially prompt injection attacks arise. These attacks trick LLMs into deviating from the original input instructions and executing the attacker's instructions injected in data content, such as retrieved results. Recent attack methods leverage LLMs' instruction-following abilities and their inabilities to distinguish instructions injected in the data content, and achieve a high attack success rate (ASR). When comparing the attack and defense methods, we interestingly find that they share similar design goals, of inducing the model to ignore unwanted instructions and instead to execute wanted instructions. Therefore, we raise an intuitive question: *Could these attack techniques be utilized for defensive purposes?* In this paper, we invert the intention of prompt injection methods to develop novel defense methods based on previous training-free attack methods, by repeating the attack process but with the original input instruction rather than the injected instruction. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our defense techniques outperform existing defense approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their impressive generative capabilities, primarily due to their extensive parameterization, which enables them to encode vast knowledge. However, effectively integrating new knowledge into LLMs remains a major challenge. Current research typically first constructs novel knowledge datasets and then injects this knowledge into LLMs through various techniques. However, existing methods for constructing new datasets either rely on timestamps, which lack rigor, or use simple templates for synthesis, which are simplistic and do not accurately reflect the real world. To address this issue, we propose a novel knowledge dataset construction approach that simulates biological evolution using knowledge graphs to generate synthetic entities with diverse attributes, resulting in a dataset, NovelHuman. Systematic analysis on NovelHuman reveals that the intra-sentence position of knowledge significantly affects the acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, we introduce an intra-sentence permutation to enhance knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, given that potential conflicts exist between autoregressive (AR) training objectives and permutation-based learning, we propose PermAR, a permutation-based language modeling framework for AR models. PermAR seamlessly integrates with mainstream AR architectures, endowing them with bidirectional knowledge acquisition capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PermAR, outperforming knowledge augmentation methods by 3.3%-38%",

The use of linked decoders allows the entire system to be jointly trained under a unified loss function. By employing a serialised training approach, DNCASR effectively addresses overlapping speech in real-world meetings, where the link improves the prediction of speaker indices in overlapping segments. Experiments on the AMI-MDM meeting corpus demonstrate that the jointly trained DNCASR outperforms a parallel system that does not have links between the speaker and ASR decoders. Using cpWER to measure the speaker-attributed word error rate, DNCASR achieves a 9.0% relative reduction on the AMI-MDM Eval set",

However, while LLMs can effectively generate personalized responses, the influence of persona sentiment on dialogue quality remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a large-scale analysis of dialogues generated using a range of polarized user profiles. Our experiments reveal that dialogues involving negatively polarized users tend to overemphasize persona attributes. In contrast, positively polarized profiles yield dialogues that selectively incorporate persona information, resulting in smoother interactions. Furthermore, we find that personas with weak or neutral sentiment generally produce lower-quality dialogues. Motivated by these findings, we propose a dialogue generation approach that explicitly accounts for persona polarity by combining a turn-based generation strategy with a profile ordering mechanism and sentiment-aware prompting. Our study provides new insights into the sensitivity of LLMs to persona sentiment and offers guidance for developing more robust and nuanced personalized dialogue systems",

To address these issues, we in this paper propose AntiLeak-Bench, an automated anti-leakage benchmarking framework. Instead of simply using newly collected data, we construct samples with explicitly new knowledge absent from LLMs' training sets, which thus ensures strictly contamination-free evaluation. We further design a fully automated workflow to build and update our benchmark without human labor.

    "abstract": "Topic modeling aims to discover the distribution of topics within a corpus. The advanced comprehension and generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have introduced new avenues for topic modeling, particularly by prompting LLMs to generate topics and refine them by merging similar ones. However, this approach necessitates that LLMs generate topics with consistent granularity, thus relying on the exceptional instruction-following capabilities of closed-source LLMs (such as GPT-4) or requiring additional training. Moreover, merging based only on topic words and neglecting the fine-grained semantics within documents might fail to fully uncover the underlying topic structure. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised topic modeling method, LiSA, that combines LLMs with clustering to improve topic generation and distribution. Specifically, we begin with prompting LLMs to generate a candidate topic word for each document, thereby constructing a topic-level semantic space. To further utilize the mutual complementarity between them, we first cluster documents and candidate topic words, and then establish a mapping from document to topic in the LLM-guided assignment stage. Subsequently, we introduce a collaborative enhancement strategy to align the two semantic spaces and establish a better topic distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that LiSA outperforms state-of-the-art methods that utilize GPT-4 on topic alignment, and exhibits competitive performance compared to Neural Topic Models on topic quality.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) help by structuring entities, relations, and contextual dependencies, but building KGs in such domains is challenging due to inherent complexity, manual effort, and rapid evolution.

First, Tree-KG builds a tree-like graph from textbook structures using large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific entities, creating an explicit KG. Then, through iterative expansion with flexible, predefined operators, it uncovers hidden KG while preserving semantic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that Tree-KG consistently surpasses competing methods, achieving the highest F1 scores (12–16% above the second-best), with notable performance (F1 0.81) on the Text-Annotated dataset, highlighting its effectiveness in extracting high-quality information from source texts. Additionally, Tree-KG provides superior structural alignment, domain-specific extraction, and cost-efficiency, delivering robust results with reduced token usage and adaptable, resource-conscious deployment",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Data diversity is crucial for the instruction tuning of large language models. Existing studies have explored various diversity-aware data selection methods to construct high-quality datasets and enhance model performance. However, the fundamental problem of precisely defining and measuring data diversity remains underexplored, limiting clear guidance for data engineering. To address this, we systematically analyze 11 existing diversity measurement methods by evaluating their correlation with model performance through extensive fine-tuning experiments. Our results indicate that a reliable diversity measure should properly account for both inter-sample differences and the information density in the sample space. Building on this, we propose NovelSum, a new diversity metric based on sample-level \"novelty.\" Experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that NovelSum accurately captures diversity variations and achieves a 0.97 correlation with instruction-tuned model performance, highlighting its value in guiding data engineering practices. With NovelSum as an optimization objective, we further develop a greedy, diversity-oriented data selection strategy that outperforms existing approaches, validating both the effectiveness and practical significance of our metric",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly suffer from **Knowledge Conflicts**, where retrieved external knowledge contradicts the inherent, parametric knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It adversely affects performance on downstream tasks such as question answering (QA). Existing approaches often attempt to mitigate conflicts by directly comparing two knowledge sources in a side-by-side manner, but this can overwhelm LLMs with extraneous or lengthy contexts, ultimately hindering their ability to identify and mitigate inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose **Micro-Act** a framework with a hierarchical action space that automatically perceives context complexity and adaptively decomposes each knowledge source into a sequence of fine-grained comparisons. These comparisons are represented as actionable steps, enabling reasoning beyond the superficial context. Through extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, Micro-Act consistently achieves significant increase in QA accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines across all 5 datasets and 3 conflict types, especially in temporal and semantic types where all baselines fail significantly. More importantly, Micro-Act exhibits robust performance on non-conflict questions simultaneously, highlighting its practical value in real-world RAG applications",

Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant.

To address this data scarcity, we develop an automatic annotation pipeline enabling multifaceted alignment among speech clips, content text, and their respective descriptions.

DNASpeech contains 2,395 distinct characters, 4,452 scenes, and 22,975 dialogue utterances, along with over 18 hours of high-quality speech recordings. To accommodate more specific task scenarios, we establish a leaderboard featuring two new subtasks for evaluation: CS-TTS with narratives and CS-TTS with dialogues. We also design an intuitive baseline model for comparison with existing state-of-the-art TTS methods on our leaderboard.

However, this fine-tuning process only compares current predictions and labels on each sample, yet fails to perceive and understand its error outputs from different degrees, which may potentially produce a large percentage of serious errors. This poses a problem for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) in that these serious errors bring a greater negative impact than acceptable ones. Humans tend to compare mistakes to understand the varying degrees of mistakes, thus avoiding major bad decisions. Inspired by this, we propose a simple yet effective framework that could perceive and understand the degree of different errors by learning from comparative error pairs. It utilizes the SFT model to yield multiple outputs on each sample and selects acceptable and severe errors based on the acceptable scores. Together with the labels, we construct two comparative error pairs and exploit their calibration losses to optimize parameters.

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) fundamentally influences how people interact with each other and, more recently, with digital technologies like large language models (LLMs). While previous research has highlighted the interaction between SES and language technology, it was limited by reliance on proxy metrics and synthetic data. We survey 1,000 individuals from ‘diverse socioeconomic backgrounds' about their use of language technologies and generative AI, and collect 6,482 prompts from their previous interactions with LLMs. We find systematic differences across SES groups in language technology usage (i.e., frequency, performed tasks), interaction styles, and topics. Higher SES entail a higher level of abstraction, convey requests more concisely, and topics like ‘inclusivity' and ‘travel'. Lower SES correlates with higher anthropomorphization of LLMs (using \"hello\" and \"thank you\") and more concrete language. Our findings suggest that while generative language technologies are becoming more accessible to everyone, socioeconomic linguistic differences still stratify their use to create a digital divide. These differences underscore the importance of considering SES in developing language technologies to accommodate varying linguistic needs rooted in socioeconomic factors and limit the AI Gap across SES groups",

We address this question along two dimensions: (1) developing a unified discourse relation label set to facilitate cross-lingual and cross-framework discourse analysis, and (2) probing LLMs to assess whether they encode generalizable discourse abstractions. Using multilingual discourse relation classification as a testbed, we examine a comprehensive set of 23 LLMs of varying sizes and multilingual capabilities. Our results show that LLMs, especially those with multilingual training corpora, can generalize discourse information across languages and frameworks. Further layer-wise analyses reveal that language generalization at the discourse level is most salient in the intermediate layers.

To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an open-source initiative dedicated to developing culturally relevant high-quality datasets for SEA languages. By involving contributors from SEA countries, SEA-VL ensures better cultural relevance and diversity, fostering greater inclusivity of underrepresented languages and cultural depictions in VL research. Our methodology employed three approaches: community-driven crowdsourcing with SEA contributors, automated image crawling, and synthetic image generation. We evaluated each method's effectiveness in capturing cultural relevance. We found that image crawling achieves approximately ~85% cultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than crowdsourcing, whereas synthetic image generation failed to accurately reflect SEA cultural nuances and contexts. Collectively, we gathered 1.28 million SEA culturally relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing datasets. This work bridges the representation gap in SEA, establishes a foundation for developing culturally aware AI systems for this region, and provides a replicable framework for addressing representation gaps in other underrepresented regions",

While zero-shot order-invariant LMs have been proposed to solve this issue, their success on practical listwise problems has been limited. In this work, as a first contribution, we identify and overcome two limitations to make zero-shot invariant LMs more practical: (1) training and inference distribution mismatch arising from modifying positional ID assignments to enforce invariance, and (2) failure to adapt to mixture of order-invariant and sensitive inputs in practical listwise problems. Then, to overcome these issues we propose (1) RoToR, a zero-shot invariant LM for genuinely order-invariant inputs with minimal modifications of positional IDs, and (2) Selective Routing, an adaptive framework that handles both order-invariant and order-sensitive inputs in listwise tasks. On the Lost in the middle (LitM), Knowledge Graph QA (KGQA), and MMLU benchmarks, we show that RoToR with Selective Routing can effectively handle practical listwise input tasks in a zero-shot manner (https://github.com/soyoung97/RoToR)",

    "abstract": "Dialogue discourse parsing aims to identify and analyze discourse relations between the utterances within dialogues. However, linguistic features in dialogues, such as omission and idiom, frequently introduce ambiguities that obscure the intended discourse relations, posing significant challenges for parsers. To address this issue, we propose a Discourse-aware Clarification Module (DCM) to enhance the performance of the dialogue discourse parser. DCM employs two distinct reasoning processes: clarification type reasoning and discourse goal reasoning. The former analyzes linguistic features, while the latter distinguishes the intended relation from the ambiguous one. Furthermore, we introduce Contribution-aware Preference Optimization (CPO) to mitigate the risk of erroneous clarifications, thereby reducing cascading errors. CPO enables the parser to assess the contributions of the clarifications from DCM and provide feedback to optimize the DCM, enhancing its adaptability and alignment with the parser's requirements. Extensive experiments on the STAC and Molweni datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively resolves ambiguities and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines",

However, these methods either disregard parameter importance entirely or evaluate it with too coarse a granularity. In this work, we introduce ImPart, a novel importance-aware delta sparsification approach. Leveraging SVD, it dynamically adjusts sparsity ratios of different singular vectors based on their importance, effectively retaining crucial task-specific knowledge even at high sparsity ratios. Experiments show that ImPart achieves state-of-the-art delta sparsification performance, demonstrating 2× higher compression ratio than baselines at the same performance level.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Social psychologists have shown that Warmth (W) and Competence (C) are the primary dimensions along which we assess other people and groups. These dimensions impact various aspects of our lives from social competence and emotion regulation to success in the work place and how we view the world. More recent work has started to explore how these dimensions develop, why they have developed, and what they constitute. Of particular note, is the finding that warmth has two distinct components: Trust (T) and Sociability (S). In this work, we introduce Words of Warmth, the first large-scale repository of manually derived word–warmth (as well as word–trust and word–sociability) associations for over 26k English words. We show that the associations are highly reliable. We use the lexicons to study the rate at which children acquire WCTS words with age. Finally, we show that the lexicon enables a wide variety of bias and stereotype research through case studies on various target entities.

    "abstract": "Language model evaluation is a daunting task: prompts are brittle, corpus-level perplexities are vague, and the choice of benchmarks are endless. Finding examples that show meaningful, generalizable differences between two LMs is crucial to understanding where one model succeeds and another fails. Can this process be done automatically? In this work, we propose methodology for automated comparison of language models that uses performance-aware contextual embeddings to find fine-grained features of text where one LM outperforms another. Our method, which we name BehaviorBox, extracts coherent features that demonstrate differences with respect to the ease of generation between two LMs. Specifically, BehaviorBox finds features that describe groups of words in fine-grained contexts, such as \"conditional ‘were' in the phrase ‘if you were'\" and \"exclamation marks after emotional statements\", where one model outperforms another within a particular datatset. We apply BehaviorBox to compare models that vary in size, model family, and post-training, and enumerate insights into specific contexts that illustrate meaningful differences in performance which cannot be found by measures such as corpus-level perplexity alone",

Most existing researchers focus on enhancing reward models through data improvements, following the conventional training framework for reward models that directly optimizes the predicted rewards.In this paper, we propose a hybrid alignment framework **HAF-RM** for reward model training by introducing an additional constraint on token-level policy probabilities in addition to the reward score. It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level.Experiment results on five datasets sufficiently show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model.By decoupling the reward modeling procedure and incorporating hybrid supervision, our **HAF-RM** framework offers a principled and effective approach to enhancing the performance and alignment of reward models, a critical component in the responsible development of powerful language models.

To address these issues, we introduce Cultural Lenses on Emotion (CuLEmo), the first benchmark designedto evaluate culture-aware emotion prediction across six languages: Amharic, Arabic, English, German, Hindi, and Spanish. CuLEmocomprises 400 crafted questions per language, each requiring nuanced cultural reasoning and understanding. We use this benchmark to evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on culture-aware emotion prediction and sentiment analysis tasks. Our findings reveal that (1) emotion conceptualizations vary significantly across languages and cultures, (2) LLMs performance likewise varies by language and cultural context, and (3) prompting in English with explicit country context often outperforms in-language prompts for culture-aware emotion and sentiment understanding.

Designed as a plug-and-play module, DiffPO can be seamlessly integrated with various base models to enhance their alignment. Extensive experiments on AlpacaEval 2, MT-bench, and HH-RLHF demonstrate that DiffPO achieves superior alignment performance across various settings, achieving a favorable trade-off between alignment quality and inference-time latency.

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but real-world applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty (LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses",

Therefore, we propose KiRAG, which uses a knowledge-driven iterative retriever model to enhance the retrieval process of iRAG. Specifically, KiRAG decomposes documents into knowledge triples and performs iterative retrieval with these triples to enable a factually reliable retrieval process. Moreover, KiRAG integrates reasoning into the retrieval process to dynamically identify and retrieve knowledge that bridges information gaps, effectively adapting to the evolving information needs. Empirical results show that KiRAG significantly outperforms existing iRAG models, with an average improvement of 9.40% in R@3 and 5.14% in F1 on multi-hop QA datasets",

LENS consolidates the vocabulary space through token embedding clustering to handle the issue of token redundancy in LLM vocabularies. To further improve performance, we investigate bidirectional attention and various pooling strategies. Specifically, LENS simplifies lexical matching with redundant vocabularies by assigning each dimension to a specific token cluster, where semantically similar tokens are grouped together. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LENS outperforms dense embeddings on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), delivering compact representations with dimensionality comparable to dense counterparts. Furthermore, LENS inherently supports efficient embedding dimension pruning without any specialized objectives like Matryoshka Representation Learning. Notably, combining LENS with dense embeddings achieves state-of-the-art performance on the retrieval subset of MTEB (i.e., BEIR)",

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation offers a promising solution by grounding generations in external knowledge, it offers no guarantee that the provided context will be effectively integrated. To address this, context-aware decoding strategies have been proposed to amplify the influence of relevant context, but they usually do not explicitly enforce faithfulness to the context. In this work, we introduce Confidence-guided Copy-based Decoding for Legal Text Generation (CoCoLex)—a decoding strategy that dynamically interpolates the model produced vocabulary distribution with a distribution derived based on copying from the context. CoCoLex encourages direct copying based on models' confidence, ensuring greater fidelity to the source. Experimental results on five legal benchmarks demonstrate that CoCoLex outperforms existing context-aware decoding methods, particularly in long-form generation tasks",

    "abstract": "Automatic N-gram based metrics such as ROUGE are widely used for evaluating generative tasks such as summarization. While these metrics are considered indicative (even if imperfect), of human evaluation for English, their suitability for other languages remains unclear. To address this, in this paper we systematically assess evaluation metrics for generation — both n-gram-based and neural-based— to assess their effectiveness across languages and tasks. Specifically, we design a large-scale evaluation suite across eight languages from four typological families — agglutinative, isolating, low-fusional, and high-fusional — from both low- and high-resource languages, to analyze their correlations with human judgments. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the evaluation metric to the language type at hand. For example, for fusional languages, n-gram-based metrics demonstrate a lower correlation with human assessments, compared to isolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that tokenization considerations can significantly mitigate this for fusional languages with rich morphology, up to reversing such negative correlations. Additionally, we show that neural-based metrics specifically trained for evaluation, such as COMET, consistently outperform other neural metrics and correlate better than ngrmas metrics with human judgments in low-resource languages. Overall, our analysis highlights the limitations of n-gram metrics for fusional languages and advocates for investment in neural-based metrics trained for evaluation tasks",

To address this, existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations. Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs",

However, existing frameworks often fail to identify uncertainty data outliers that violate the exchangeability assumption, leading to unbounded miscoverage rates and unactionable prediction sets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach termed Selective Conformal Uncertainty (SConU), which, for the first time, implements significance tests, by developing two conformal p-values that are instrumental in determining whether a given sample deviates from the uncertainty distribution of the calibration set at a specific manageable risk level. Our approach not only facilitates rigorous management of miscoverage rates across both single-domain and interdisciplinary contexts, but also enhances the efficiency of predictions. Furthermore, we comprehensively analyze the components of the conformal procedures, aiming to approximate conditional coverage, particularly in high-stakes question-answering tasks",

However, concerns over the potential leakage of knowledge files have grown significantly. Existing studies demonstrate that adversarial prompts can induce GPTs to leak knowledge file content. Yet, it remains uncertain whether additional leakage vectors exist, particularly given the complex data flows across clients, servers, and databases in GPTs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive risk assessment of knowledge file leakage, leveraging a novel workflow inspired by Data Security Posture Management (DSPM). Through the analysis of 651,022 GPT metadata, 11,820 flows, and 1,466 responses, we identify five leakage vectors: metadata, GPT initialization, retrieval, sandboxed execution environments, and prompts. These vectors enable adversaries to extract sensitive knowledge file data such as titles, content, types, and sizes. Notably, the activation of the built-in tool Code Interpreter leads to a privilege escalation vulnerability, enabling adversaries to directly download original knowledge files with a 95.95% success rate. Further analysis reveals that 28.80% of leaked files are copyrighted, including digital copies from major publishers and internal materials from a listed company.

Furthermore, to enrich the semantic density of the codec without auxiliary modules, we propose a self-supervised mask prediction modeling approach. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that UniCodec achieves excellent audio reconstruction performance across the three audio domains, outperforming existing unified neural codecs with a single codebook, and even surpasses state-of-the-art domain-specific codecs on both acoustic and semantic representation capabilities",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Synthetic data has driven recent state-of-the-art advancements, but reliance on a single oracle teacher model can lead to model collapse and bias propagation. These issues are particularly severe in multilingual settings, where no single model excels across all languages. In this study, we propose multilingual arbitration, which exploits performance variations among multiple models for each language. By strategically routing samples through a diverse set of models, each with unique strengths, we mitigate these challenges and enhance multilingual performance. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses single-teacher distillation, achieving up to 80% win rates over proprietary and open-weight models like Gemma 2, Llama 3.1, and Mistral v0.3, with the largest improvements in low-resource languages",

In this paper, we propose Controlled LoRA (CLoRA), a subspace regularization method on LoRA structure. Aiming to reduce the scale of output change while introducing minimal constraint on model capacity, CLoRA imposes constraints on the direction of updating matrix's null space. Experimental results on one-stage LLM finetuning tasks and continual learning settings highlight the superiority of CLoRA as an effective parameter-efficient finetuning method with catastrophic forgetting mitigating. Further investigation for model parameters indicates that CLoRA effectively balances the trade-off between model capacity and degree of forgetting.

However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensivedatasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines.

    "abstract": "Existing LLM-based agents have achieved strong performance on held-in tasks, but their generalizability to unseen tasks remains poor. Hence, some recent work focus on fine-tuning the policy model with more diverse tasks to improve the generalizability. In this work, we find that finetuning a reward model to guide the policy model is more robust than directly finetuning the policy model.Based on this finding, we propose AgentRM, a 8B generalizable reward model, to guide the policy model for effective test-time search.We comprehensively investigate three approaches to construct the reward model, including explicit reward modeling, implicit reward modeling and LLM-as-a-judge.We then use AgentRM to guide the answer generation with Best-of-N sampling and beam search.We show that AgentRM is robust to paraphrasings of task instructions and can generalize to unseen tasks that require novel optimal behavior.Through extensive evaluation across nine tasks spanning four categories, AgentRM enhances the non-finetuned 8B policy model by 8.8 points on average, surpassing the top general agent by 4.0.Moreover, it demonstrates weak-to-strong generalization, yielding greater improvement on more powerful policy models.As for the specializability, AgentRM can also boost a finetuned policy model and outperform the top specialized agent by 11.4 on three held-in tasks.Further analysis verifies its effectiveness in test-time scaling.We release the code and data at https://github.com/thunlp/AgentRM",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Inference-time alignment methods have gained significant attention for their efficiency and effectiveness in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, existing dominant approaches, reward-guided search (RGS), suffer from a critical granularity mismatch: reward models (RMs) are trained on complete responses but applied to incomplete sequences during generation, leading to inconsistent scoring and suboptimal alignment. To combat the challenge, we argue that an ideal RM should satisfy two objectives: Score Consistency, ensuring coherent evaluation across partial and complete responses, and Preference Consistency, aligning partial sequence assessments with human preferences. To achieve these, we propose SPRM, a novel dual-consistency framework integrating score consistency-based and preference consistency-based partial evaluation modules, which leverage the Bradley-Terry model and entropy-based reweighting to predict cumulative rewards and prioritize human-aligned sequences. Extensive experiments on dialogue, summarization, and reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SPRM, significantly reducing granularity discrepancies by up to 11.7 on TL;DR Summarization and achieving a 3.6%–10.3% improvement in GPT-4 evaluation scores across all tasks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Causal masking is a fundamental component in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models, playing a crucial role during training. Although GPTs can process the entire user prompt at once, the causal masking is applied to all input tokens step-by-step, mimicking the generation process. This imposes an unnecessary constraint during the initial \"prefill\" phase when the model processes the input prompt and generates the internal representations before producing any output tokens. In this work, attention is masked based on the known block structure at the prefill phase, followed by the conventional token-by-token autoregressive process after that. For example, in a typical chat prompt, the system prompt is treated as one block, and the user prompt as the next one. Each of these is treated as a unit for the purpose of masking, such that the first tokens in each block can access the subsequent tokens in a non-causal manner. Then, the model answer is generated in the conventional causal manner. The Segment-by-Segment scheme entails no additional computational overhead. When integrated using a lightweight fine-tuning into already trained models such as Llama and Qwen, MAS quickly increases models' performances",

    "title": "Cramming 1568 Tokens into a Single Vector and Back Again: Exploring the Limits of Embedding Space Capacity",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "A range of recent works addresses the problem of compression of sequence of tokens into a shorter sequence of real-valued vectors to be used as inputs instead of token embeddings or key-value cache. These approaches are focused on reduction of the amount of compute in existing language models rather than minimization of number of bits needed to store text. Despite relying on powerful models as encoders, the maximum attainable lossless compression ratio is typically not higher than x10. This fact is highly intriguing because, in theory, the maximum information capacity of large real-valued vectors is far beyond the presented rates even for 16-bit precision and a modest vector size. In this work, we explore the limits of compression by replacing the encoder with a per-sample optimization procedure. We show that vectors with compression ratios up to x1500 exist, which highlights two orders of magnitude gap between existing and practically attainable solutions. Furthermore, we empirically show that the compression limits are determined not by the length of the input but by the amount of uncertainty to be reduced, namely, the cross-entropy loss on this sequence without any conditioning. The obtained limits highlight the substantial gap between the theoretical capacity of input embeddings and their practical utilization, suggesting significant room for optimization in model design",

However, LLM-based generative sequential recommendation often faces two key challenges: the lack of collaborative knowledge and the limited controllability over the generated content. In this paper, we propose a simple Bi-Tuning framework with collaborative information for controllable Large Language Model-based Sequential Recommendation (Laser). Specifically, Bi-Tuning works through incorporating learnable virtual tokens at both the prefix and suffix of the input text, where the prefix tokens enable the adaptation of LLMs with collaborative information, while the suffix token transforms the LLM output into item/user embeddings for similarity comparison, thereby facilitating controllable recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce an MoE-based querying transformer that selectively activates experts to extract relevant information from varying collaborative signals of frozen ID-based recommenders into the prefix, coupled with a multi-task loss function incorporating the MoE load-balancing objective. Finally, a two-phase training strategy is employed to progressively obtain high-quality item and user embeddings through the learnable suffix. Experiments on real-world datasets show that Laser effectively adapts LLMs for sequential recommendation, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines",

Small language models (SLMs) offer a cost-effective alternative, but their limited capacity requires biomedical domain adaptation, which remains challenging. An additional bottleneck is the unavailability and high sensitivity of clinical data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for adapting SLMs into high-performing clinical models. We introduce the MediPhi collection of 3.8B-parameter SLMs developed with our novel framework: pre-instruction tuning of experts on relevant medical and clinical corpora (PMC, Medical Guideline, MedWiki, etc.), model merging, and clinical-tasks alignment. To cover most clinical tasks, we extended the CLUE benchmark to CLUE+, doubling its size. Our expert models deliver relative improvements on this benchmark over the base model without any task-specific fine-tuning: 64.3% on medical entities, 49.5% on radiology reports, and 44% on ICD-10 coding (outperforming GPT-4-0125 by 14%). We unify the expert models into MediPhi via model merging, preserving gains across benchmarks. Furthermore, we built the MediFlow collection, a synthetic dataset of 2.5 million high-quality instructions on 14 medical NLP tasks, 98 fine-grained document types, and JSON format support. Alignment of MediPhi using supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization achieves further gains of 18.9% on average",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture achieve high cost-efficiency by selectively activating a subset of the parameters. Despite the inference efficiency of MoE LLMs, the training of extensive experts from scratch incurs substantial overhead, whereas reconstructing a dense LLM into an MoE LLM significantly reduces the training budget. However, existing reconstruction methods often overlook the diversity among experts, leading to potential redundancy. In this paper, we come up with the observation that a specific LLM exhibits notable diversity after being pruned on different calibration datasets, based on which we present a Diversity-Enhanced reconstruction method named DIVE. The recipe of DIVE includes domain affinity mining, pruning-based expert reconstruction, and efficient retraining. Specifically, the reconstruction includes pruning and reassembly of the feed-forward network (FFN) module. After reconstruction, we efficiently retrain the model on routers, experts and normalization modules. We implement DIVE on Llama-style LLMs with open-source training corpora. Experiments show that DIVE achieves training efficiency with minimal accuracy trade-offs, outperforming existing pruning and MoE reconstruction methods with the same number of activated parameters.

Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term Position Generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions in a tolerant manner, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. In this work, we show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms to allow for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, in this work, LLMs are revealed to learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits, where their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features that enables this effect, suggesting that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture.

We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the preference classification ability of LLMs using RewardBench, assessing models across different sizes, architectures, and training levels to validate our hypothesis. Furthermore, we investigate the self-improvement capabilities of LLMs by generating multiple responses for a given instruction and employing the model itself as a preference classifier for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-based training.

RoT utilizes a Preference-Guided Reverse Reasoning warm-up strategy, which integrates logical symbols for pseudocode planning through meta-cognitive mechanisms and pairwise preference self-evaluation to generate task-specific prompts solely through demonstrations, aligning with LLMs' cognitive preferences shaped by RLHF. Through reverse reasoning, we utilize a Cognitive Preference Manager to assess knowledge boundaries and further expand LLMs' reasoning capabilities by aggregating solution logic for known tasks and stylistic templates for unknown tasks. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate that RoT surpasses existing baselines in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency",

    "abstract": "Be it your favorite novel, a newswire article, a cooking recipe or an academic paper – in many daily situations we read the same text more than once. In this work, we ask whether it is possible to automatically determine whether the reader has previously encountered a text based on their eye movement patterns during reading. We introduce two variants of this task and address them using both feature-based and neural models. We further introduce a general strategy for enhancing these models with machine generated simulations of eye movements from a cognitive model. Finally, we present an analysis of model performance which on the one hand yields insights on the information used by the models, and on the other hand leverages predictive modeling as an analytic tool for better characterization of the role of memory in repeated reading. Our work advances the understanding of the extent and manner in which eye movements in reading capture memory effects from prior text exposure, and paves the way for future applications that involve predictive modeling of repeated reading",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Despite the fact that large language models (LLMs) show exceptional skill in instruction following tasks, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when the models are required to disregard certain instructions. Instruction following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as instructional distraction. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named **DIM-Bench**, specifically designed to assess LLMs' performance under instructional distraction. The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four instruction tasks: proofreading, rewriting, translation, and style transfer—alongside five input tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias detection, and question answering. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs are susceptible to instructional distraction, often failing to accurately follow user intent in such cases",

Despite extensive efforts dedicate to enhancing inference efficiency, these methods primarily exploit internal sparsity within the models, without leveraging external information for optimization. We identify the high similarity of attention matrices across different-scale LLMs, which offers a novel perspective for optimization. We first conduct a comprehensive analysis of how to measure similarity, how to select mapping Layers and whether mapping is consistency. Based on these insights, we introduce the IAM framework, which achieves dual benefits of accelerated attention computation and reduced KV cache usage by performing attention mapping between small and large LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that IAM can accelerate prefill by 15% and reduce KV cache usage by 22.1% without appreciably sacrificing performance. Experiments on different series of models show the generalizability of IAM. Importantly, it is also orthogonal to many existing KV cache optimization methods, making it a versatile addition to the current toolkit for enhancing LLM efficiency",

This setting permits granular measurement of model calibration based on how early, accurately, and confidently a model answers. After collecting these questions, we host live human vs. model competitions to gather 1,749 data points on human and model teams' timing, accuracy, and confidence. We propose a metric, CalScore, that uses GRACE to analyze model calibration errors and identify types of model miscalibration that differ from human behavior. We find that although humans are less accurate than models, humans are generally better calibrated.

Through a detailed analysis of the optimization process, we introduce a novel conceptual framework to elucidate transferability and identify superfluous constraints—specifically, the response pattern constraint and the token tail constraint—as significant barriers to improved transferability. Removing these unnecessary constraints substantially enhances the transferability and controllability of gradient-based attacks.

To this end, we construct a set of multilingual prompts that offers a carefully controlled setting accounting for the complex grammatical differences influencing gender across languages. Our results show strong gender biases and notable language-specific differences across models. While we explore prompt engineering strategies to mitigate these biases, we find them largely ineffective and sometimes even detrimental to text-to-image alignment.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multimodal learning has celebrated remarkable success across diverse areas, yet faces the challenge of prohibitively expensive data collection and annotation when adapting models to new environments. In this context, domain adaptation has gained growing popularity as a technique for knowledge transfer, which, however, remains underexplored in multimodal settings compared with unimodal ones. This paper investigates multimodal domain adaptation, focusing on a practical partially shifting scenario where some modalities (referred to as anchors) remain domain-stable, while others (referred to as drifts) undergo a domain shift. We propose a bi-alignment scheme to simultaneously perform drift-drift and anchor-drift matching. The former is achieved through adversarial learning, aligning the representations of the drifts across source and target domains; the latter corresponds to an \"anchor dragging drift\" strategy, which matches the distributions of the drifts and anchors within the target domain using the optimal transport (OT) method. The overall design principle features Adversarial Alignment with Anchor Dragging Drift, abbreviated as A3D2, for multimodal domain adaptation with partially shifted modalities. Comprehensive empirical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and demonstrate that A3D2 achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complexity and diversity of realistically retrieved context. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed as automated evaluators to assess the safety of generated content, yet their reliability in this role remains uncertain. This study evaluates a diverse set of 11 LLM judge models across critical safety domains, examining three key aspects: self-consistency in repeated judging tasks, alignment with human judgments, and susceptibility to input artifacts such as apologetic or verbose phrasing. Our findings reveal that biases in LLM judges can significantly distort the final verdict on which content source is safer, undermining the validity of comparative evaluations. Notably, apologetic language artifacts alone can skew evaluator preferences by up to 98%. Contrary to expectations, larger models do not consistently exhibit greater robustness, while smaller models sometimes show higher resistance to specific artifacts. To mitigate LLM evaluator robustness issues, we investigate jury-based evaluations aggregating decisions from multiple models. Although this approach both improves robustness and enhances alignment to human judgements, artifact sensitivity persists even with the best jury configurations. These results highlight the urgent need for diversified, artifact-resistant methodologies to ensure reliable safety assessments",

    "abstract": "In modern large language models (LLMs), LLM alignment is of crucial importance and is typically achieved through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO). However, in most existing methods for LLM alignment, all tokens in the response are optimized using a sparse, response-level reward or preference annotation. The ignorance of token-level rewards may erroneously punish high-quality tokens or encourage low-quality tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance and slow convergence speed. To address this issue, we propose AlignDistil, a RLHF-equivalent distillation method for token-level reward optimization. Specifically, we introduce the reward learned by DPO into the RLHF objective and theoretically prove the equivalence between this objective and a token-level distillation process, where the teacher distribution linearly combines the logits from the DPO model and a reference model. On this basis, we further bridge the accuracy gap between the reward from the DPO model and the pure reward model, by building a contrastive DPO reward with a normal and a reverse DPO model. Moreover, to avoid under- and over-optimization on different tokens, we design a token adaptive logit extrapolation mechanism to construct an appropriate teacher distribution for each token. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our AlignDistil over existing methods and showcase fast convergence due to its token-level distributional reward optimization",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, including natural language processing, data analysis, and software development, by enabling automation. In software engineering, LLM-powered coding agents have garnered significant attention due to their potential to automate complex development tasks, assist in debugging, and enhance productivity. However, existing approaches often struggle with sub-optimal decision-making, requiring either extensive manual intervention or inefficient compute scaling strategies. To improve coding agent performance, we present Dynamic Action Re-Sampling (DARS), a novel inference time compute scaling approach for coding agents, that is faster and more effective at recovering from sub-optimal decisions compared to baselines. While traditional agents either follow linear trajectories or rely on random sampling for scaling compute, our approach DARS works by branching out a trajectory at certain key decision points by taking an alternative action given the history of the trajectory and execution feedback of the previous attempt from that point. We evaluate our approach on SWE-Bench Lite benchmark, demonstrating that this scaling strategy achieves a pass@k score of 55% with Claude 3.5 Sonnet V2. Our framework achieves a pass@1 rate of 47%, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source frameworks",

In contrast to the original studies, which evaluated a handful of models, we test up to 36 models belonging to 14 families with sizes ranging from 1.5B to 70B parameters. Our experiments reveal substantial variability in the effectiveness of the steering approaches, with a large number of models showing no improvement and at times degradation in steering performance.

    "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) enhances efficiency by sharing representations across tasks, but task dissimilarities often cause partial learning, where some tasks dominate while others are neglected. Existing methods mainly focus on balancing loss or gradients but fail to fundamentally address this issue due to the representation discrepancy in latent space. In this paper, we propose variance-invariant probabilistic decoding for multi-task learning (VIP-MTL), a framework that ensures impartial learning by harmonizing representation spaces across tasks. VIP-MTL decodes shared representations into task-specific probabilistic distributions and applies variance normalization to constrain these distributions to a consistent scale. Experiments on two language benchmarks show that VIP-MTL outperforms 12 representative methods under the same multi-task settings, especially in heterogeneous task combinations and data-constrained scenarios. Further analysis shows that VIP-MTL is robust to sampling distributions, efficient on optimization process, and scale-invariant to task losses. Additionally, the learned task-specific representations are more informative, enhancing the language understanding abilities of pre-trained language models under the multi-task paradigm",

However, we argue that the use of widespread LLMs in services like ChatGPT is more prevalent–and riskier, as they are not designed for this purpose. To explore this, we analysed user interactions with ChatGPT outside of its marketed use as a task-oriented assistant. In dialogues classified as lonely, users frequently (37%) sought advice or validation, and received good engagement. However, ChatGPT failed in sensitive scenarios, like responding appropriately to suicidal ideation or trauma. We also observed a 35% higher incidence of toxic content, with women being 22× more likely to be targeted than men.

Mainstream speaker diarization systems rely only on acoustic information, making the task particularly challenging in complex acoustic environments in real-world applications. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to audio-visual or audio-semantic multimodal modeling to enhance speaker diarization performance; however, these approaches still struggle to address the complexities of speaker diarization on spontaneous and unstructured multi-party conversations. To fully exploit meaningful dialogue patterns, we propose a novel multimodal approach that jointly utilizes audio, visual, and semantic cues to enhance speaker diarization. Our approach structures visual cues among active speakers and semantic cues in spoken content into a cohesive format known as pairwise constraints, and employs a semi-supervised clustering technique based on pairwise constrained propagation. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple multimodal datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively integrates audio-visual-semantic information into the clustering process for acoustic speaker embeddings and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art speaker diarization methods, while largely preserving the overall system framework",

While current large language models (LLMs) have excelled in natural language tasks, they remain vulnerable to variations in text formatting.Recent research demonstrates that modifying input formats, such as vertically aligning words for encoder-based models, can substantially lower accuracy in text classification tasks. While easily understood by humans, these inputs can significantly mislead models, posing a potential risk of bypassing detection in real-world scenarios involving harmful or sensitive information. With the expanding application of LLMs, a crucial question arises: Do decoder-based LLMs exhibit similar vulnerabilities to vertically formatted text input? In this paper, we investigate the impact of vertical text input on the performance of various LLMs across multiple text classification datasets and analyze the underlying causes. Our findings are as follows: (i) Vertical text input significantly degrades the accuracy of LLMs in text classification tasks. (ii) Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning does not help LLMs recognize vertical input or mitigate its vulnerability, but few-shot learning with careful analysis does. (iii) We explore the underlying cause of the vulnerability by analyzing the inherent issues in tokenization and attention matrices",

Often, the training process saves checkpoints as artifacts that are under-utilized as a source of in-training data signals. We identify these artifact models based on their respective capabilities on the benchmarks and leverage them as data mixers by using their aggregated first-order influence approximation over source data. We demonstrated on eight reasoning benchmarks that the proposed framework shows significant improvements in the pretraining setting, with accuracy increases of up to 1.93%.

Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+ demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability to unseen languages.

However, many of them have a closely-related high-resource language (HRL) neighbor, and differ in linguistically regular ways from it. This underscores the importance of model robustness to dialectal variation and cross-lingual generalization to the HRL dialect continuum. We present DialUp, consisting of a training-time technique for adapting a pretrained model to dialectal data (M–>D), and an inference-time intervention adapting dialectal data to the model expertise (D–>M). M–>D induces model robustness to potentially unseen and unknown dialects by exposure to synthetic data exemplifying linguistic mechanisms of dialectal variation, whereas D–>M treats dialectal divergence for known target dialects. These methods show considerable performance gains for several dialects from four language families, and modest gains for two other language families. We also conduct feature and error analyses, which show that language varieties with low baseline MT performance are more likely to benefit from these approaches",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "When aligning large language models (LLMs), their performance across various tasks (such as being helpful, harmless, and honest) is heavily influenced by the composition of the training data. However, it is difficult to determine what mixture of data should be used to produce a model with strong performance across all tasks. Existing approaches rely on large ablation studies, heuristics, or human intuition, though these can be prohibitively expensive and suboptimal. We study this problem in the context of preference optimization via DPO and propose a novel and theoretically justified algorithm, AutoMixAlign (AMA), that adaptively mixes datasets during LLM training to balance performance across multiple tasks. AMA first trains specialist models for each task to determine losses that corresponding to strong task performance. Next, AMA trains a generalist model using a novel minimax optimization that prioritizes tasks for which generalist model losses are furthest from specialist model losses. We introduce two algorithms to optimize this problem: (1) AMA-R adaptively reweights the objective to prioritize tasks, and (2) AMA-S adaptively adjusts how much data is sampled from each task to prioritize tasks. Both algorithms achieve a convergence rate of O(1/√T) in the convex case. AMA-R's convergence result immediately follows from Sagawa et. al, 2019, and we provide a convergence proof for AMA-S using techniques from online learning such as EXP3 (Auer et. al, 2002). We evaluate AMA on several multitask alignment setups, and observe that AMA outperforms the standard alignment approach which simply optimizes the total loss across all tasks and also outperforms model-merging methods",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) capture relational and commonsense knowledge effectively, they are computationally expensive and often underperform in tasks requiring efficient relational encoding, such as relation induction, extraction, and information retrieval. Despite advancements in learning relational embeddings, existing methods often fail to capture nuanced representations and the rich semantics needed for high-quality embeddings. In this work, we propose different relational encoders designed to capture diverse relational aspects and semantic properties of entity pairs. Although several datasets exist for training such encoders, they often rely on structured knowledge bases or predefined schemas, which primarily encode simple and static relations. To overcome this limitation, we also introduce a novel dataset generation method leveraging LLMs to create a diverse spectrum of relationships.

However, fine-tuning still remains essential to achieve satisfactory performance on downstream tasks, while the task-specific tuning samples are usually not readily available or expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this, we propose an error-driven data-efficient tuning framework that aims to efficiently adapt generic LMMs to newly emerging tasks without requiring extensive task-specific training samples. In our approach, a generic LMM, acting as a student model, is first evaluated on a small validation set of the target task, and then a more powerful model, acting as a teacher model, identifies the erroneous steps within the student model's reasoning steps and analyzes its capability gaps from fully addressing the target task. Based on these gaps, targeted training samples are further retrieved from existing task-agnostic datasets to tune the student model and tailor it to the target task. We perform extensive experiments across three different training data scales and seven tasks, demonstrating that our training paradigm significantly and efficiently improves LMM's performance on downstream tasks, achieving an average performance boost of 7.01%",

However, existing dialogue planning methods generate dialogue plans in a step-by-step sequential manner, and may suffer from compounding errors and myopic actions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel dialogue planning framework, DiffTOD, which leverages diffusion models to enable non-sequential dialogue planning. DiffTOD formulates dialogue planning as a trajectory generation problem with conditional guidance, and leverages a diffusion language model to estimate the likelihood of the dialogue trajectory. To optimize the dialogue action strategies, DiffTOD introduces three tailored guidance mechanisms for different target types, offering flexible guidance toward diverse TOD targets at test time. Extensive experiments across three diverse TOD settings show that DiffTOD can effectively perform non-myopic lookahead exploration and optimize action strategies over a long horizon through non-sequential dialogue planning, and demonstrates strong flexibility across complex and diverse dialogue scenarios.

To address these challenges, we propose REPL-Plan, an LLM planning approach that is fully code-expressive (it can utilize all the benefits of code) while also being dynamic (it can flexibly adapt from errors and use the LLM for soft reasoning). In REPL-Plan, an LLM solves tasks by interacting with a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which iteratively executes and evaluates code, similar to language shells or interactive code notebooks, allowing the model to flexibly correct errors and handle tasks dynamically.

The weak model, tailored to specific domains, produces initial drafts and background information, while the strong model leverages its advanced reasoning to refine these drafts, extending LLMs' capabilities to critical yet specialized tasks. To optimize this collaboration, we introduce a collaborative feedback to fine-tunes the weak model, which quantifies the influence of the weak model's contributions in the collaboration procedure and establishes preference pairs to guide preference tuning of the weak model. We validate our framework through experiments on three domains. We find that the collaboration significantly outperforms each model alone by leveraging complementary strengths.

In this work, we are the first to investigate the impact of real-world SDCs on LLM training by comparing model training between healthy production nodes and unhealthy nodes exhibiting SDCs. With the help from a cloud computing platform, we access the unhealthy nodes that were swept out from production by automated fleet management. Using deterministic execution via XLA compiler and our proposed synchronization mechanisms, we isolate and analyze the impact of SDC errors on these nodes at three levels: at each submodule computation, at a single optimizer step, and at a training period. Our results reveal that the impact of SDCs on computation varies on different unhealthy nodes. Although in most cases the perturbations from SDCs on submodule computation and gradients are relatively small, SDCs can lead models to converge to different optima with different weights and even cause spikes in the training loss. Our analysis sheds light on further understanding and mitigating the impact of SDCs",

Furthermore, our experiments reveal that models trained to exhibit higher conscientiousness, higher agreeableness, lower extraversion, and lower neuroticism display better performance on reasoning tasks, aligning with psychological findings on how these traits impact human cognitive performance.

First methods that have been proposed so far embed concepts from automatically constructed colexification networks. While these approaches depart from automatically inferred polysemies, attested across a larger number of languages, they are restricted to the word level, ignoring lexical relations that would only hold for parts of the words in a given language. Building on recently introduced methods for the inference of partial colexifications, we show how they can be used to improve concept embeddings in meaningful ways. The learned embeddings are evaluated against lexical similarity ratings, recorded instances of semantic shift, and word association data. We show that in all evaluation tasks, the inclusion of partial colexifications lead to improved concept representations and better results.

    "title": "Multi-Attribute Steering of Language Models via Targeted Intervention",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Inference-time intervention (ITI) has emerged as a promising method for steering large language model (LLM) behavior in a particular direction (e.g., improving helpfulness) by intervening on token representations without costly updates to the LLM's parameters. However, existing ITI approaches fail to scale to multi-attribute settings with conflicts, such as enhancing helpfulness while also reducing toxicity. To address this, we introduce Multi-Attribute Targeted Steering (MAT-Steer), a novel steering framework designed for selective token-level intervention across multiple attributes. We achieve this by learning steering vectors using an alignment objective that shifts the model's internal representations of undesirable outputs closer to those of desirable ones while enforcing sparsity and orthogonality among vectors for different attributes, thereby reducing inter-attribute conflicts. We evaluate MAT-Steer in two distinct settings: (i) on question answering (QA) tasks where we balance attributes like truthfulness, bias, and toxicity; (ii) on generative tasks where we simultaneously improve attributes like helpfulness, correctness, and coherence. MAT-Steer outperforms existing ITI and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches across both task types (e.g., average 3% accuracy gain across QA tasks and 55.82% win rate against the best ITI baseline)",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art multimodal web agents, powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), can autonomously execute many web tasks by processing user instructions and interacting with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Current strategies for building web agents rely on (i) the generalizability of underlying MLLMs and their steerability via prompting, and (ii) large-scale fine-tuning of MLLMs on web-related tasks. However, web agents still struggle to automate tasks on unseen websites and domains, limiting their applicability to enterprise-specific and proprietary platforms. Beyond generalization from large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, we propose building agents for few-shot adaptability using human demonstrations. We introduce the AdaptAgent framework that enables both proprietary and open-weights multimodal web agents to adapt to new websites and domains using few human demonstrations (up to 2). Our experiments on two popular benchmarks — Mind2Web & VisualWebArena — show that using in-context demonstrations (for proprietary models) or meta-adaptation demonstrations (for meta-learned open-weights models) boosts task success rate by 3.36% to 7.21% over non-adapted state-of-the-art models, corresponding to a relative increase of 21.03% to 65.75%. Furthermore, our additional analyses (a) show the effectiveness of multimodal demonstrations over text-only ones, (b) illuminate how different meta-learning data selection strategies influence the agent's generalization, and (c) demonstrate how the number of few-shot examples affects the web agent's success rate. Our results offer a complementary axis for developing widely applicable multimodal web agents beyond large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning, emphasizing few-shot adaptability",

    "abstract": "Peer review is fundamental to scientific research, but the growing volume of publications has intensified the challenges of this expertise-intensive process. While LLMs show promise in various scientific tasks, their potential to assist with peer review, particularly in identifying paper limitations, remains understudied. We first present a comprehensive taxonomy of limitation types in scientific research, with a focus on AI. Guided by this taxonomy, for studying limitations, we present LimitGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability to support early-stage feedback and complement human peer review. Our benchmark consists of two subsets: LimitGen-Syn, a synthetic dataset carefully created through controlled perturbations of high-quality papers, and LimitGen-Human, a collection of real human-written limitations. To improve the ability of LLM systems to identify limitations, we augment them with literature retrieval, which is essential for grounding identifying limitations in prior scientific findings. Our approach enhances the capabilities of LLM systems to generate limitations in research papers, enabling them to provide more concrete and constructive feedback",

    "abstract": "Crosslingual transfer is crucial to contemporary language models' multilingual capabilities, but how it occurs is not well understood. Weask what happens to a monolingual language model when it begins to be trained on a second language. Specifically, we train small bilingual models for which we control the amount of data for each language and the order of language exposure. To find evidence of shared multilingual representations, we turn to structural priming, a method used to study grammatical representations in humans. We first replicate previous crosslingual structural priming results and find that after controlling for training data quantity and language exposure, there are asymmetrical effects across language pairs and directions. We argue that this asymmetry may shape hypotheses about human structural priming effects. We also find that structural priming effects are less robust for less similar language pairs, highlighting potential limitations of crosslingual transfer learning and shared representations for typologically diverse languages",

In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions give us an attribution measure of how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic interaction. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases with non-compositional semantics. Our speech results show that inputs are more entangled for pairs where a neighboring consonant is likely to influence a vowel or approximant, showing that models encode the phonetic interaction needed for extracting discrete phonemic representations",

Put succinctly, we answer the following question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models",

In this paper, we propose using computational methods to identify unreliable narrators, i.e. those who unintentionally misrepresent information.

We define classification tasks for intra-narrational, inter-narrational, and inter-textual unreliabilities and analyze the performance of popular open-weight and proprietary LLMs for each. We propose learning from literature to perform unreliable narrator classification on real-world text data. To this end, we experiment with few-shot, fine-tuning, and curriculum learning settings. Our results show that this task is very challenging, and there is potential for using LLMs to identify unreliable narrators.

To address these, we introduce ConceptCarve, an evidence retrieval framework that utilizes traditional retrievers and LLMs to dynamically characterize the search space during retrieval.

In this paper we introduce a novel task Quantitative Query-Focused Summarization (QQSUM), which aims to summarize diverse customer opinions into representative Key Points (KPs) and quantify their prevalence to effectively answer user queries. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows promise for PQA, its generated answers still fall short of capturing the full diversity of viewpoints. To tackle this challenge, our model QQSUM-RAG, which extends RAG, employs few-shot learning to jointly train a KP-oriented retriever and a KP summary generator, enabling KP-based summaries that capture diverse and representative opinions.

    "abstract": "Language models excel at following instructions but often struggle with the collaborative aspects of conversation that humans naturally employ. This limitation in grounding—the process by which conversation participants establish mutual understanding—can lead to outcomes ranging from frustrated users to serious consequences in high-stakes scenarios. To systematically study grounding challenges in human-LLM interactions, we analyze logs from three human-assistant datasets: WildChat, MultiWOZ, and Bing Chat. We develop a taxonomy of grounding acts and build models to annotate and forecast grounding behavior. Our findings reveal significant differences in human-human and human-LLM grounding: LLMs were three times less likely to initiate clarification and sixteen times less likely to provide follow-up requests than humans. Additionally, we find that early grounding failures predict later interaction breakdowns. Building on these insights, we introduce Rifts, a benchmark derived from publicly available LLM interaction data containing situations where LLMs fail to initiate grounding. We note that current frontier models perform poorly on Rifts, highlighting the need to reconsider how we train and prompt LLMs for human interaction. To this end, we develop a preliminary intervention aimed at mitigating grounding failures",

We find that users highly value core functionality, and that stylistic components in absence of core components are viewed negatively.

Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we (i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii) enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation, respectively",

Our framework tracks the mental state of a simulated client, controls its state transitions, and generates for each state behaviors consistent with the client's motivation, beliefs, preferred plan to change, and receptivity. By varying the client profile and receptivity, we demonstrate that consistent simulated clients for different counseling scenarios can be effectively created.

These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI principles and improving counseling outcomes for diverse clients. We evaluate CAMI's performance through both automated and expert evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency, client's state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall counseling success. Results show that CAMI not only outperforms several state-of-the-art methods but also shows more realistic counselor-like behavior.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "User simulators are crucial for replicating human interactions with dialogue systems, supporting both collaborative training and automatic evaluation, especially for large language models (LLMs). However, current role-playing methods face challenges such as a lack of utterance-level authenticity and user-level diversity, often hindered by role confusion and dependence on predefined profiles of well-known figures. In contrast, direct simulation focuses solely on text, neglecting implicit user traits like personality and conversation-level consistency. To address these issues, we introduce the User Simulator with Implicit Profiles (USP), a framework that infers implicit user profiles from human-machine interactions to simulate personalized and realistic dialogues. We first develop an LLM-driven extractor with a comprehensive profile schema, then refine the simulation using conditional supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with cycle consistency, optimizing at both the utterance and conversation levels. Finally, a diverse profile sampler captures the distribution of real-world user profiles. Experimental results show that USP outperforms strong baselines in terms of authenticity and diversity while maintaining comparable consistency. Additionally, using USP to evaluate LLM on dynamic multi-turn aligns well with mainstream benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications",

However, conventional benchmarks based on learner-produced texts are insufficient for conducting detailed evaluations of GEC model performance across a wide range of grammar items due to biases in their distribution.To address this issue, we propose a new evaluation paradigm that assesses GEC models using minimal pairs of ungrammatical and grammatical sentences for each grammar item. As the first benchmark within this paradigm, we introduce the CEFR-based Targeted Syntactic Evaluation Dataset for Grammatical Error Correction (CTSEG), which complements existing English benchmarks by enabling fine-grained analyses previously unattainable with conventional datasets. Using CTSEG, we evaluate three mainstream types of English GEC models: sequence-to-sequence models, sequence tagging models, and prompt-based models. The results indicate that while current models perform well on beginner-level grammar items, their performance deteriorates substantially for intermediate and advanced items",

To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VQ-Eval, which introduces four tasks—coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation—to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VQ-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark.

Prior methods steer LLMs via descriptions of subpopulations as LLMs' input prompt, yet such prompt engineering approaches have struggled to faithfully predict the distribution of survey responses from human subjects. In this work, we propose directly fine-tuning LLMs to predict response distributions by leveraging unique structural characteristics of survey data. To enable fine-tuning, we curate SubPOP, a significantly scaled dataset of 3,362 questions and 70K subpopulation-response pairs from well-established public opinion surveys. We show that fine-tuning on SubPOP greatly improves the match between LLM predictions and human responses across various subpopulations, reducing the LLM-human gap by up to 46% compared to baselines, and achieves strong generalization to unseen surveys and subpopulations.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) increases the difficulty of distinguishing between human-written and LLM-generated text. Detecting LLM-generated text is crucial for upholding academic integrity, preventing plagiarism, protecting copyrights, and ensuring ethical research practices. Most prior studies on detecting LLM-generated text focus primarily on English text. However, languages with distinct morphological and syntactic characteristics require specialized detection approaches. Their unique structures and usage patterns hinder the direct application of methods primarily designed for English. Among such languages, we focus on Korean, which has relatively flexible spacing rules, a rich morphological system, and less frequent comma usage compared to English. We introduce KatFish, the first benchmark dataset for detecting LLM-generated Korean text. The dataset consists of text written by humans and generated by four LLMs across three genres. By examining spacing patterns, part-of-speech diversity, and comma usage, we illuminate the linguistic differences between human-written and LLM-generated Korean text. Building on these observations, we propose KatFishNet, a detection method specifically designed for the Korean language.

By augmenting Text-to-SQL datasets with synthetic CoT solutions, we achieve, for the first time, consistent and significant performance improvements using DPO.Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning is crucial for unlocking DPO's potential, as it mitigates reward hacking, strengthens discriminative capabilities, and improves scalability.

Being available to users from diverse cultural backgrounds, Large Language Models (LLMs) should also be able to provide accurate information irrespective of the measurement system at hand. Using newly compiled datasets we test if this is truly the case for seven open-source LLMs, addressing three key research questions: (RQ1) What is the default system used by LLMs for each type of measurement? (RQ2) Do LLMs' answers and their accuracy vary across different measurement systems? (RQ3) Can LLMs mitigate potential challenges w.r.t. underrepresented systems via reasoning? Our findings show that LLMs default to the measurement system predominantly used in the data. Additionally, we observe considerable instability and variance in performance across different measurement systems. While this instability can in part be mitigated by employing reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought (CoT), this implies longer responses and thereby significantly increases test-time compute (and inference costs), marginalizing users from cultural backgrounds that use underrepresented measurement systems",

In this work, we find that LLMs exhibit concerning biases in how they associate solution veracity with demographics. Through experiments across five human value-aligned LLMs on mathematics, coding, commonsense, and writing problems, we reveal two forms of such veracity biases: Attribution Bias, where models disproportionately attribute correct solutions to certain demographic groups, and Evaluation Bias, where models' assessment of identical solutions varies based on perceived demographic authorship. Our results show pervasive biases: LLMs consistently attribute fewer correct solutions and more incorrect ones to African-American groups in math and coding, while Asian authorships are least preferred in writing evaluation. In additional studies, we show LLMs automatically assign racially stereotypical colors to demographic groups in visualization code, suggesting these biases are deeply embedded in models' reasoning processes.

To effectively support these applications, grounding in spatial and temporal understanding in multimodal environments is essential. To this end, recent works have leveraged scene graphs, a structured representation that encodes entities, attributes, and their relationships in a scene. However, a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' ability to utilize scene graphs remains limited. In this work, we introduce Text-Scene Graph (TSG) Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess LLMs' ability to (1) understand scene graphs and (2) generate them from textual narratives. With TSG Bench we evaluate 11 LLMs and reveal that, while models perform well on scene graph understanding, they struggle with scene graph generation, particularly for complex narratives. Our analysis indicates that these models fail to effectively decompose discrete scenes from a complex narrative, leading to a bottleneck when generating scene graphs. These findings underscore the need for improved methodologies in scene graph generation and provide valuable insights for future research.

In this paper, we reveal a novel **provider bias** in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the **first** comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (e.g., domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE. Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing Top-(CITATION) or Top-(CITATION) routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures. For instance, compared with vanilla Top- (CITATION) routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75 BLEU with less than 22% activated parameters on multi-domain translation tasks",

Experiments on **MCEval8k**, a multi-genre multiple-choice knowledge benchmark, support NEG's ability to represent model knowledge. Further analysis highlights the key properties of NEG-based skill representation: efficiency, robustness, flexibility, and interdependency.Code and data are released",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing tasks that aim to infer an author's private states, e.g., emotions and opinions, from their written text, typically rely on datasets annotated by third-party annotators. However, the assumption that third-party annotators can accurately capture authors' private states remains largely unexamined. In this study, we present human subjects experiments on emotion recognition tasks that directly compare third-party annotations with first-party (author-provided) emotion labels. Our findings reveal significant limitations in third-party annotations—whether provided by human annotators or large language models (LLMs)—in faithfully representing authors' private states. However, LLMs outperform human annotators nearly across the board. We further explore methods to improve third-party annotation quality. We find that demographic similarity between first-party authors and third-party human annotators enhances annotation performance. While incorporating first-party demographic information into prompts leads to a marginal but statistically significant improvement in LLMs' performance. We introduce a framework for evaluating the limitations of third-party annotations and call for refined annotation practices to accurately represent and model authors' private states",

    "abstract": "Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, driven by improvements in deep learning and neural network architectures. Viewing the output speech as a data distribution, previous approaches often employ traditional speech representations, such as waveforms or spectrograms, within the Flow Matching framework. However, these methods have limitations, including overlooking various speech attributes and incurring high computational costs due to additional constraints introduced during training. To address these challenges, we introduce OZSpeech, the first TTS method to explore optimal transport conditional flow matching with one-step sampling and a learned prior as the condition, effectively disregarding preceding states and reducing the number of sampling steps. Our approach operates on disentangled, factorized components of speech in token format, enabling accurate modeling of each speech attribute, which enhances the TTS system's ability to precisely clone the prompt speech. Experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance over existing methods in content accuracy, naturalness, prosody generation, and speaker style preservation.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first demonstrate Alignment in parametric space is the fundamental prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called LaTen (Locate-Then-Align) that aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify Neural Incompatibility as the ethological and parametric structural differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future research on efficient PKT.

We propose a novel prompting method named Stepwise Correction (StepCo) that helps LLMs identify and revise incorrect steps in their generated reasoning paths. It iterates verification and revision phases that employ a process-supervised verifier. The verify-then-revise process not only improves answer correctness but also reduces token consumption with fewer paths needed to generate. With StepCo, a series of LLMs demonstrate exceptional performance. Notably, using GPT-4o as the backend LLM, StepCo achieves an average accuracy of 94.1 across eight datasets, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art Best-of-N method by +2.4, while reducing token consumption by 77.8%.

Developing effective conversational agents for psychotherapy requires access to high-quality, real-world, long-term client-counselor interaction data, which is difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. Although removing personally identifiable information is feasible, this process is labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data reconstruction method that reconstructs real-world client-counselor dialogues while mitigating privacy concerns. We apply the RMRR (Retrieve, Mask, Reconstruct, Refine) method, which facilitates the creation of the privacy-preserving PsyDial dataset, with an average of 37.8 turns per dialogue. Extensive analysis demonstrates that PsyDial effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining dialogue diversity and conversational exchange. To fairly and reliably evaluate the performance of models fine-tuned on our dataset, we manually collect 101 dialogues from professional counseling books. Experimental results show that models fine-tuned on PsyDial achieve improved psychological counseling performance, outperforming various baseline models. A user study involving counseling experts further reveals that our LLM-based counselor provides higher-quality responses.

To address this issue, we introduce a model-agnostic two-stage Consistency Reflection and Correction (CRC) framework. Specifically, in the consistency reflection stage, the model is prompted to reflect on the discrepancies between generated responses and dialogue contexts, identifying inconsistencies and suggesting possible corrections. In the consistency correction stage, the model generates responses that are more consistent with the dialogue context based on these reflection results. We conducted experiments on various model architectures with different parameter sizes, including encoder-decoder models (BART, T5) and decoder-only models (GPT-2, DialoGPT, Phi3, Mistral and LLaMA3), and the experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our CRC framework significantly improves the consistency between generated responses and dialogue contexts",

To mitigate this cognitive burden, we introduce a novel reasoning prompt strategy, called EoT, which effectively reduces cognitive load by steering the model's attention away from erroneous options. This enables the model to focus more effectively on reasonable answers. Additionally, by documenting the elimination process, EoT enhances the transparency and interpretability of the model's reasoning.

Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous experiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then, the generated ideas can be implemented using a code template refined and debugged with the designed exception-traceback-guided local code structure. Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets of different topics and a subset of MLE-bench. Results show that Dolphin can continuously improve the performance of the input topic in a loop.

However, they sometimes generate responses that are logically coherent but factually incorrect or misleading, which is known as LLM hallucinations. Data-driven supervised methods train hallucination detectors by leveraging the internal states of LLMs, but detectors trained on specific domains often struggle to generalize well to other domains. In this paper, we aim to enhance the cross-domain performance of supervised detectors with only in-domain data. We propose a novel framework, prompt-guided internal states for hallucination detection of LLMs, namely PRISM. By utilizing appropriate prompts to guide changes to the structure related to text truthfulness in LLMs' internal states, we make this structure more salient and consistent across texts from different domains. We integrated our framework with existing hallucination detection methods and conducted experiments on datasets from different domains. The experimental results indicate that our framework significantly enhances the cross-domain generalization of existing hallucination detection methods",

To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into their historical background and contemporary perception.

Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the contentious terms detected in their metadata.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language generation and general task performance. However, their application to spoken language understanding (SLU) remains challenging, particularly for token-level tasks, where the autoregressive nature of LLMs often leads to misalignment issues. They also struggle to capture nuanced interrelations in semantic-level tasks through direct fine-tuning alone. To address these challenges, we propose the Entity-level Language Model (ECLM) framework, which reformulates slot-filling as an entity recognition task and introduces a novel concept, Chain of Intent, to enable step-by-step multi-intent recognition. Experimental results show that ECLM significantly outperforms strong baselines such as Uni-MIS, achieving gains of 3.7% on MixATIS and 3.1% on MixSNIPS.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval systems have demonstrated significant potential in handling knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these models often struggle with unfaithfulness issues, generating outputs that either ignore the retrieved context or inconsistently blend it with the LLM's parametric knowledge. This issue is particularly severe in cases of knowledge conflict, where the retrieved context conflicts with the model's parametric knowledge. While existing faithful RAG approaches enforce strict context adherence through well-designed prompts or modified decoding strategies, our analysis reveals a critical limitation: they achieve faithfulness by forcibly suppressing the model's parametric knowledge, which undermines the model's internal knowledge structure and increases the risk of misinterpreting the context. To this end, this paper proposes FaithfulRAG, a novel framework that resolves knowledge conflicts by explicitly modeling discrepancies between the model's parametric knowledge and retrieved context. Specifically, FaithfulRAG identifies conflicting knowledge at the fact level and designs a self-thinking process, allowing LLMs to reason about and integrate conflicting facts before generating responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/Faithful-RAG",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving substantial potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on program semantics. Specifically, it utilizes the task of synthesizing formal program specifications as a proxy measure for assessing the semantic reasoning of LLMs. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs to synthesize consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.

We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection.Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks.Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains.

These technologies pose a threat of misuse for identity theft and the spread of misinformation. Consequently, the misuse of such powerful technologies necessitates the development of robust and generalizable audio deepfake detection (ADD) and anti-spoofing models.

Such biases reduce the usability of these models and highlight the urgent need for multilingual synthetic speech datasets for bias mitigation research.

Recently, generation-augmented methods have emerged as a promising solution to this problem. These methods enhance raw queries by incorporating additional information from an LLM-based generator, facilitating more direct retrieval of relevant documents. However, existing methods struggle with highly specialized situations that require extensive domain expertise. To address this problem, we present Reinforced-IR, a novel approach that jointly adapts a pre-trained retriever and generator for precise cross-domain retrieval. A key innovation of Reinforced-IR is its Self-Boosting framework, which enables retriever and generator to learn from each other's feedback. Specifically, the generator is reinforced to generate query augmentations that enhance the retriever's performance, while the retriever is trained to better discriminate the relevant documents identified by the generator. This iterative process allows the end-to-end retrieval performance to be progressively optimized using an unlabeled corpus from the target domain. In our experiment, Reinforced-IR outperforms existing domain adaptation methods by a large margin, leading to substantial improvements in retrieval quality across a wide range of application scenarios.We have publicly released our code at this repo",

First, we map unimodal data to the latent space of Gaussian distributions to capture core features and structure, thereby learn stable modality representation. Then, we combine the quantified inherent modality uncertainty to learn stable multimodal joint representation (i.e., proxy modality), which is further enhanced through multi-layer dynamic cross-modal injection to increase its diversity. Extensive experimental results show that P-RMF outperforms existing models in noise resistance and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The effectiveness of open-domain question answering (ODQA), particularly those employing a retriever-reader architecture, depends on the ability to recall relevant documents - a critical step that enables the reader to accurately extract answers. To enhance this retrieval phase, current query expansion (QE) techniques leverage pre-trained language models (PLM) to mitigate word mismatches and improve the recall of relevant documents. Despite their advancements, these techniques often treat all expanded terms uniformly, which can lead to less-than-optimal retrieval outcomes. In response, we propose a novel Recall-oriented Adaptive Learning (ReAL) method, which iteratively adjusts the importance weights of QE terms based on their relevance, thereby refining term distinction and enhancing the separation of relevant terms. Specifically, ReAL employs a similarity-based model to classify documents into pseudo-relevant and pseudo-irrelevant sets, and then optimizes term weights via two tailored loss functions to maximize the scoring gap between them. Experiments on four ODQA datasets and five QE methods show that ReAL consistently enhances retrieval accuracy and overall end-to-end QA performance, providing a robust and efficient solution for improving QE strategies in ODQA scenarios",

However, existing methods often suffer from limitations, including high intra-group similarity, loss of semantic information, and insufficient inference capability, particularly in complex relation patterns such as 1-N and N-1 relations. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel KGE framework that leverages mutual information maximization to improve the semantic representation of entities and relations. By maximizing the mutual information between different components of triples, such as (h, r) and t, or (r, t) and h, the proposed method improves the model's ability to preserve semantic dependencies while maintaining the relational structure of the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with consistent performance improvements across various baseline models. Additionally, visualization analyses and case studies demonstrate the improved ability of the MI framework to capture complex relation patterns",

    "abstract": "Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs",

    "abstract": "In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces Trace, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instruction-following ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 5.91%, 2.83% on out-of-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a parameter-efficient framework ProMALex, that first derives hierarchical relationships across jurisdictions and progressively inserts adapter modules across model layers based on jurisdictional similarity. This design allows modules in lower layers to be shared across jurisdictions, capturing common legal principles, while higher layers specialize through jurisdiction-specific adapters.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large Language Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks like text matching, smaller fine-tuned models often produce more effective domain-specific representations as they focus on optimizing the similarity between input pairs. To combine the specialized strengths of small models with the rich semantic understanding of LLMs, we propose a flipped knowledge distillation paradigm, where the LLM learns from the SLM. To bridge the architectural gap between commonly used decoder-only LLMs and the encoder-based frameworks of smaller models, we reinterpret LLMs as encoder-decoder models using LoRA. In this setup, the encoder generates compressed text representations, while the decoder transforms them into the output space. During training, the encoder produces text representations and computes their similarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the teacher model. We achieve this alignment using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach. MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, while also adaptively handling differences within positive and negative samples. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on financial and healthcare benchmarks as well as real-world online applications.

Extensive evaluations are conducted on a wide range of models, revealing a notable \"Cultural-Linguistic Synergy\" phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and linguistically model evaluations",

This process is crucial for improving the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLP models. However, a significant challenge remains: Insufficient Attention to Sample Distribution Diversity. Most existing methods focus on increasing the sample numbers while neglecting the sample distribution diversity, which can lead to model overfitting. In response, we explore data augmentation's impact on dataset diversity and propose a Diversity-oriented data Augmentation framework (DoAug). Specifically, we utilize a diversity-oriented fine-tuning approach to train a large language model (LLM) as a diverse paraphraser, which is capable of augmenting textual datasets by generating diversified paraphrases. Then, we apply the LLM paraphraser to a selected coreset of highly informative samples and integrate the paraphrases with the original data to create a more diverse augmented dataset. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world textual datasets. The results show that our fine-tuned LLM augmenter improves diversity while preserving label consistency, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of downstream tasks. Specifically, it achieves an average performance gain of 10.52%, surpassing the runner-up baseline with more than three percentage points",

To address these limitations, we propose CoreEval, a Contamination-resilient Evaluation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant and up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism in a Chain-of-Thought manner to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets.

Existing methods for automatic prompt optimization face two challenges: lack of diversity, limiting the exploration of valuable and innovative directions and semantic drift, where optimizations for one task can degrade performance in others. To address these issues, we propose Residual Optimization Tree (RiOT), a novel framework for automatic prompt optimization. RiOT iteratively refines prompts through text gradients, generating multiple semantically diverse candidates at each step, and selects the best prompt using perplexity. Additionally, RiOT incorporates the text residual connection to mitigate semantic drift by selectively retaining beneficial content across optimization iterations. A tree structure efficiently manages the optimization process, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks — covering commonsense, mathematical, logical, temporal, and semantic reasoning — demonstrate that RiOT outperforms both previous prompt optimization methods and manual prompting.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 31% higher per-layer efficiency via a \"mid-activation, late-amplification\" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a \"basic-refinement\" framework—shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow Olmoe suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness",

LESA uses a neural network to predict the parameters inserted between adjacent layers, enabling better initialization and faster training.

With data collected from real-world scenarios, MMRC comprises 5,120 conversations and 28,720 corresponding manually labeled questions, posing a significant challenge to existing MLLMs. Evaluations on 20 MLLMs in MMRC indicate an accuracy drop during open-ended interactions. We identify four common failure patterns: long-term memory degradation, inadequacies in updating factual knowledge, accumulated assumption of error propagation, and reluctance to \"say no.\" To mitigate these issues, we propose a simple yet effective NOTE-TAKING strategy, which can record key information from the conversation and remind the model during its responses, enhancing conversational capabilities.

    "title": "Towards the Law of Capacity Gap in Distilling Language Models",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Language model (LM) distillation aims at distilling the knowledge in a large teacher LM to a small student one. As a critical issue facing LM distillation, a superior student often arises from a teacher of a relatively small scale instead of a larger one, especially in the presence of substantial capacity gap between the teacher and student. This issue, often referred to as the curse of capacity gap, suggests that there is likely an optimal teacher yielding the best-performing student along the scaling course of the teacher. Consequently, distillation trials on teachers of a wide range of scales are called for to determine the optimal teacher, which becomes computationally intensive in the context of large LMs (LLMs). This paper addresses this critical bottleneck by providing the law of capacity gap inducted from a preliminary study on distilling a broad range of small-scale (<3B) LMs, where the optimal teacher consistently scales linearly with the student scale across different model and data scales. By extending the law to LLM distillation on a larger scale (7B), we succeed in obtaining versatile LLMs that outperform a wide array of competitors",

While locate-and-edit methods address this, their reliance on models' internal representations leads to robustness failures in long-context reasoning and paraphrased queries. We identify a fundamental limitation of locate-and-edit methods: existing semantic keys (for memory localization) cannot simultaneously satisfy robustness (context-invariant activation) and specificity (precise knowledge discrimination). Through theoretical error-bound analysis, we establish formal criteria for effective editing.Our solution introduces Robust Edit Pathway (REP), a plug-and-play module that: (1) disentangles editing keys from native model representations; (2) dynamically adjusts keys via contrastive learning to achieve robustness-specificity balance. Extensive experiments across various editing methods (ROME/MEMIT/R-ROME/EMMET), existing LLMs (LLaMA2, QWen, Mistral), and datasets (CounterFact, ZsRE) show that REP improves success rate over robustness tests by up-to 66.4% while maintaining the success rate unaffected",

We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators.

Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored.

We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance.

    "abstract": "Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a fundamental psychological capability that allows humans to understand and interpret the mental states of others. Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global context, especially personal background of characters. In this paper, we verify the importance of comprehensive contextual understanding about personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such complex scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce CharToM-QA benchmark, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 and DeepSeek-R1 models, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training.

Specifically, we first initialize LLMs with iterative self-verification and self-correction behaviors through supervised fine-tuning on carefully curated data. The self-verification and self-correction skills are then further strengthened by outcome-level and process-level reinforcement learning with minimized resource requirements. Our results demonstrate that, with only 3.1k behavior initialization samples, Qwen2.5-math-7B achieves an accuracy improvement from 51.0% to 81.6%, outperforming models trained on an equivalent amount of long-CoT distilled data.

    "title": "Advancing Collaborative Debates with Role Differentiation through Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multi-agent collaborative tasks exhibit exceptional capabilities in natural language applications and generation. By prompting agents to assign clear roles, it is possible to facilitate cooperation and achieve complementary capabilities among LLMs. A common strategy involves adopting a relatively general role assignment mechanism, such as introducing a \"judge\" or a \"summarizer\". However, these approaches lack task-specific role customization based on task characteristics. Another strategy involves decomposing the task based on domain knowledge and task characteristics, followed by assigning appropriate roles according to LLMs' respective strengths, such as programmers and testers. However, in some given tasks, obtaining domain knowledge related to task characteristics and getting the strengths of different LLMs is hard. To solve these problems, we propose a Multi-LLM Cooperation (MLC) framework with automatic role assignment capabilities. The core idea of the MLC is to initialize role assignments randomly and then allow the role embeddings to be learned jointly with the downstream task. To capture the state transitions of multiple LLMs during turn-based speaking, the role embedding is sequence-aware. At the same time, to avoid role convergence, the role differentiation module in MLC encourages behavioral differentiation between LLMs while ensuring the LLM team consistency, guiding different LLMs to develop complementary strengths from the optimization level. Our experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that MLC significantly enhances collaboration and expertise, which collaboratively addresses multi-agent tasks",

To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation",

This graph is populated based on expert interaction data and used to study the assessment process and facilitate human-AI collaboration. We formally define STRICTA and apply it in a study on biomedical paper assessment, resulting in a dataset of over 4000 reasoning steps from roughly 40 biomedical experts on more than 20 papers. We use this dataset to empirically study expert reasoning in critical text assessment, and investigate if LLMs are able to imitate and support experts within these workflows.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) generate human-like text, raising concerns about their misuse in creating deceptive content. Detecting LLM-generated comments (LGC) in online news is essential for preserving online discourse integrity and preventing opinion manipulation. However, effective detection faces two key challenges; the brevity and informality of news comments limit traditional methods, and the absence of a publicly available LGC dataset hinders model training, especially for languages other than English. To address these challenges, we propose a twofold approach. First, we develop an LGC generation framework to construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and complex examples. Second, we introduce XDAC (XAI-Driven Detection and Attribution of LLM-Generated Comments), a framework utilizing explainable AI, designed for the detection and attribution of short-form LGC in Korean news articles. XDAC leverages XAI to uncover distinguishing linguistic patterns at both token and character levels. We present the first large-scale benchmark dataset, comprising 1.3M human-written comments from Korean news platforms and 1M LLM-generated comments from 14 distinct models. XDAC outperforms existing methods, achieving a 98.5% F1 score in LGC detection with a relative improvement of 68.1%, and an 84.3% F1 score in attribution. To validate real-world applicability, we analyze 5.24M news comments from Naver, South Korea's leading online news platform, identifying 27,029 potential LLM-generated comments",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "With the growing deployment of pre-trained models like Transformers on cloud platforms, privacy concerns about model parameters and inference data are intensifying. Existing Privacy-Preserving Transformer Inference (PPTI) frameworks face the \"impossible trinity\" of balancing privacy, efficiency, and performance: Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)-based approaches ensure strong privacy but suffer from high computational overhead and performance losses; Conversely, permutation-based methods achieve near-plaintext efficiency and accuracy but compromise privacy by exposing sensitive model parameters and intermediate results. Bridging this gap with a single approach presents substantial challenges, motivating the introduction of CENTAUR, a groundbreaking PPTI framework that seamlessly integrates random permutations and SMPC to address the \"impossible trinity\". By designing efficient PPTI algorithms tailored to the structural properties of Transformer models, CENTAUR achieves an unprecedented balance among privacy, efficiency, and performance. Our experiments demonstrate CENTAUR's ability to resist diverse data reconstruction attacks, achieve plaintext-level inference accuracy, and boost inference speed by 5.0~30.4 times, unlocking new possibilities for secure and efficient AI deployment",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "To meet the demands of content moderation, online platforms have resorted to automated systems. Newer forms of real-time engagement (e.g., users commenting on live streams) on platforms like Twitch exert additional pressures on the latency expected of such moderation systems. Despite their prevalence, relatively little is known about the effectiveness of these systems. In this paper, we conduct an audit of Twitch's automated moderation tool (AutoMod) to investigate its effectiveness in flagging hateful content. For our audit, we create streaming accounts to act as siloed test beds, and interface with the live chat using Twitch's APIs to send over 107,000 comments collated from 4 datasets. We measure AutoMod‘s accuracy in flagging blatantly hateful content containing misogyny, racism, ableism and homophobia. Our experiments reveal that a large fraction of hateful messages, up to 94% on some datasets, bypass moderation. Contextual addition of slurs to these messages results in 100% removal, revealing AutoMod‘s reliance on slurs as a hate signal. We also find that contrary to Twitch's community guidelines, AutoMod blocks up to 89.5% of benign examples that use sensitive words in pedagogical or empowering contexts. Overall, our audit points to large gaps in AutoMod‘s capabilities and underscores the importance for such systems to understand context effectively",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Being able to thoroughly assess massive multi-task language understanding (MMLU) capabilities is essential for advancing the applicability of multilingual language models. However, preparing such benchmarks in high quality native language is often costly and therefore limits the representativeness of evaluation datasets. While recent efforts focused on building more inclusive MMLU benchmarks, these are conventionally built using machine translation from high-resource languages, which may introduce errors and fail to account for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of the target languages. In this paper, we address the lack of native language MMLU benchmark especially in the under-represented Turkic language family with distinct morphosyntactic and cultural characteristics. We propose two benchmarks for Turkic language MMLU: TUMLU is a comprehensive, multilingual, and natively developed language understanding benchmark specifically designed for Turkic languages. It consists of middle- and high-school level questions spanning 11 academic subjects in Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Turkish, Uyghur, and Uzbek. We also present TUMLU-mini, a more concise, balanced, and manually verified subset of the dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluate a diverse range of open and proprietary multilingual large language models (LLMs), including Claude, Gemini, GPT, and LLaMA, offering an in-depth analysis of their performance across different languages, subjects, and alphabets. To promote further research and development in multilingual language understanding, we release TUMLU-mini and all corresponding evaluation scripts",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements have demonstrated the advantage of converting pretrained large language models into powerful text encoders by enabling bidirectional attention in transformer layers. However, existing methods often require extensive training on large-scale datasets, posing challenges in low-resource, domain-specific scenarios. In this work, we show that a pretrained large language model can be converted into a strong text encoder without additional training. We first conduct a comprehensive empirical study to investigate different conversion strategies and identify the impact of the attention sink phenomenon on the performance of converted encoder models. Based on our findings, we propose a novel approach that enables bidirectional attention and suppresses the attention sink phenomenon, resulting in superior performance. Extensive experiments on multiple domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

We assume that a single setting doesn't represent the distribution of the vast corpora, causing members and non-members with different distributions to be sampled and causing inconsistency. In this study, instead of a single setting, we statistically revisit MIA methods from various settings with thousands of experiments for each MIA method, along with study in text feature, embedding, threshold decision, and decoding dynamics of members and non-members. We found that (1) MIA performance improves with model size and varies with domains, while most methods do not statistically outperform baselines, (2) Though MIA performance is generally low, a notable amount of differentiable member and non-member outliers exists and vary across MIA methods, (3) Deciding a threshold to separate members and non-members is an overlooked challenge, (4) Text dissimilarity and long text benefit MIA performance, (5) Differentiable or not is reflected in the LLM embedding, (6) Member and non-members show different decoding dynamics",

However, the abilities of language models in this area are largely unexplored as previous work has tested their abilities for logical reasoning in terms of time and space in isolation or only in simple or artificial environments. In this paper, we present the first evaluation of the ability of language models to jointly reason over time and space. To enable our analysis, we create GeoTemp, a dataset of 320k prompts covering 289 cities in 217 countries and 37 time zones. Using GeoTemp, we evaluate eight open chat models of three different model families for different combinations of temporal and geographic knowledge. We find that most models perform well on reasoning tasks involving only temporal knowledge and that overall performance improves with scale. However, performance remains constrained in tasks that require connecting temporal and geographical information. We do not find clear correlations of performance with specific geographic regions. Instead, we find a significant performance increase for location names with low model perplexity, suggesting their repeated occurrence during model training. We further demonstrate that their performance is heavily influenced by prompt formulation - a direct injection of geographical knowledge leads to performance gains, whereas, surprisingly, techniques like chain-of-thought prompting decrease performance on simpler tasks",

We select three standard datasets and proceed into two steps. First, we focus on HLV and analyze the linguistic features (complexity, polarity, pragmatic phenomena, lexical choices) that correlate with HLV. Next, we proceed to uncertainty and its relationship to HLV. We experiment with RoBERTa and Flan-T5 in a number of training setups and evaluation metrics that test the calibration of uncertainty to HLV and its relationship to performance beyond majority vote; next, we analyze the impact of linguistic features on uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Social media platforms are experiencing a growing presence of AI-Generated Texts (AIGTs). However, the misuse of AIGTs could have profound implications for public opinion, such as spreading misinformation and manipulating narratives. Despite its importance, it remains unclear how prevalent AIGTs are on social media. To address this gap, this paper aims to quantify and monitor the AIGTs on online social media platforms. We first collect a dataset (SM-D) with around 2.4M posts from 3 major social media platforms: Medium, Quora, and Reddit. Then, we construct a diverse dataset (AIGTBench) to train and evaluate AIGT detectors. AIGTBench combines popular open-source datasets and our AIGT datasets generated from social media texts by 12 LLMs, serving as a benchmark for evaluating mainstream detectors. With this setup, we identify the best-performing detector (OSM-Det). We then apply OSM-Det to SM-D to track AIGTs across social media platforms from January 2022 to October 2024, using the AI Attribution Rate (AAR) as the metric. Specifically, Medium and Quora exhibit marked increases in AAR, rising from 1.77% to 37.03% and 2.06% to 38.95%, respectively. In contrast, Reddit shows slower growth, with AAR increasing from 1.31% to 2.45% over the same period. Our further analysis indicates that AIGTs on social media differ from human-written texts across several dimensions, including linguistic patterns, topic distributions, engagement levels, and the follower distribution of authors. We envision our analysis and findings on AIGTs in social media can shed light on future research in this domain",

X-CIT emulates the human process of second language acquisition and is guided by Chomsky's Principles and Parameters Theory.

This chat-instruction data captures alignment information in translated parallel data, guiding the model to initially think and respond in its native language before transitioning to the target language. To further mimic human learning progression, we incorporate Self-Paced Learning (SPL) during continued training, allowing the model to advance from simple to complex tasks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Many positional encodings (PEs) are designed to exhibit long-term decay, based on an entrenched and long-standing inductive opinion: tokens farther away from the current position carry less relevant information. We argue that long-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to tasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary positions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating that models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while forming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term decay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding (RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the U-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key factor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation. Inspired by these insights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE replaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones, retaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of long-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without constraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit attention optimization are removed. Thus, the model's context awareness is enhanced. (2) HoPE exhibits greater robustness to the out-of-distribution behavior in attention patterns during extrapolation. The effectiveness of HoPE is validated through extensive experiments and with a large language model of up to 3 billion parameters",

Given that, it is advantageous to train a once-for-all (OFA) supernet capable of yielding diverse optimal subnets for downstream applications through one-shot training. Nonetheless, the scale of current language models impedes efficiency and amplifies interference from weight sharing between subnets. We make an initial attempt to extend the once-for-all framework to large language models. Specifically, we decouple shared weights to eliminate the interference and incorporate Low-Rank adapters for training efficiency. Furthermore, we observe the imbalance allocation of training resources from the traditional uniform sampling. A non-parametric scheduler is introduced to adjust the sampling rate for each quantization configuration, achieving a more balanced allocation among subnets with varying demands. We validate the approach on LLaMA2 families and Mistral on downstream evaluation, demonstrating high performance while significantly reducing deployment time faced with multiple scenarios",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs), known as teacher models, into lightweight versions called student models, enabling efficient inference and downstream applications. However, prevailing approaches accomplish this by predominantly focusing on matching the final output distributions of student/teacher models. Drawing on the perspective that transformers can be viewed as discretizing ordinary differential equation (ODEs) on integer time steps (corresponding to layer indices), where intermediate features evolve across layers, we argue that effective KD requires aligning the entire feature dynamics between teacher and student models, which we call feature dynamics distillation (FDD). This alignment involves matching both the feature trajectory and its first-order derivative, rather than just the final states. Our approach extends the original KD objective with two additional loss terms: layer-wise feature KD, which matches discretized feature trajectory, and layer feature delta KD, which matches first-order changes in features across adjacent layers. Extensive experiments on various tasks validate the effectiveness of our distillation method",

As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning.

We propose a new RL framework with ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning, and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models. Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we propose **C**ritical **R**epresentation **F**ine-**T**uning (CRFT), a novel method that identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework, dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Notably, our method improves the accuracy of LLaMA-2-7B and ReFT by 18.2 and 3.8, respectively, on GSM8K, while using only 0.016 of the model parameters, significantly less than other PEFT methods. Furthermore, our method also adapts effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4. Our work highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods",

    "abstract": "According to psychological and neuroscientific research, a high-stress environment can restrict attentional resources and intensify negative affect, thereby impairing the ability to understand emotions. Furthermore, demographic attributes such as race, gender, and age group have been repeatedly reported to cause significant differences in emotional expression and recognition. This study is the first to systematically verify whether these psychological findings observed in humans also apply to the latest Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs). We constructed low-stress versus high-stress environments and generated an image dataset (a total of 540 images) that combines race, gender, and age group. Based on this, we applied the Pretend prompt technique to induce LVLMs to interpret others' emotions from the standpoint of the assigned environment and persona. An analysis of the models' emotional understanding ability, using EQ-Bench-based metrics, revealed that (1) under high-stress environments, the accuracy of emotion understanding significantly declined in most LVLMs, and (2) performance disparities were confirmed across race, gender, and age group. These findings suggest that the effects of high-stress and demographic attributes identified in human research may also be reflected in LVLMs",

Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure.

To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior.

In this study, we introduce a two-dimensional analysis framework—comprising token back-tracing and individual token decoding—to uncover how LLMs conduct factual knowledge recall. Through explanatory analysis of three typical reasoning datasets, we identify a consistent three-phase pattern: Subject Augmentation and Broadcasting, Object Retrieval and Reranking, and Conclusion Fusion and Generation. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not lack relevant knowledge but struggle to select the most accurate information based on context during the retrieval and rerank phase.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for continuous-space reasoning that does not require modifying the LLM.

In this paper, we introduce MobiLoRA to accelerate LoRA-based LLM inference on mobile devices. MobiLoRA focuses on optimizing the key-value (KV) caches due to the limited computing and memory resources of mobile devices. The key insight of MobiLoRA lies in the utilization of two contexts for on-device LoRA serving: semantic-level contexts, such as prompts with shared prefixes, and system-level contexts, such as the application status (e.g., foreground or killed) of LLM requests. Specifically, for semantic-level contexts, MobiLoRA proposes similarity-aware delta encoding, which leverages token-wise similarity in KV caches across LoRA adapters for efficient storage and reuse.

    "title": "Language Models Resist Alignment: Evidence From Data Compression",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the elasticity of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of multi-hop question answering (MHQA) systems. Despite the success of MHQA systems, the evaluation of MHQA is not deeply investigated. Existing evaluations mainly focus on comparing the final answers of the reasoning method and given ground-truths. We argue that the reasoning process should also be evaluated because wrong reasoning process can also lead to the correct final answers. Motivated by this, we propose a \"Planner-Executor-Reasoner\" (PER) architecture, which forms the core of the Plan-anchored Data Preprocessing (PER-DP) and the Plan-guided Multi-Hop QA (PER-QA).The former provides the ground-truth of intermediate reasoning steps and final answers, and the latter offers them of a reasoning method. Moreover, we design a fine-grained evaluation metric called Plan-aligned Stepwise Evaluation (PSE), which evaluates the intermediate reasoning steps from two aspects: planning and solving. Extensive experiments on ten types of questions demonstrate competitive reasoning performance, improved explainability of the MHQA system, and uncover issues such as \"fortuitous reasoning continuance\" and \"latent reasoning suspension\" in RAG-based MHQA systems. Besides, we also demonstrate the potential of our approach in data contamination scenarios",

We rely on theoretical and empirical connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms.

Using them we trace how information is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others appear universally across all models inspected—hinting that these may be inherent to LLMs in general.

    "abstract": "Recent remarkable advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to innovations in various domains such as education, healthcare, and finance, while also raising serious concerns that they can be easily misused for malicious purposes. Most previous research has focused primarily on observing how jailbreak attack techniques bypass safety mechanisms like Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF). However, whether there are neurons within LLMs that directly govern aggression has not been sufficiently investigated. To fill this gap, this study identifies specific neurons (\"aggression neurons\") closely related to the expression of aggression and systematically analyzes how manipulating them affects the model's overall aggression. Specifically, using a large-scale synthetic text corpus (aggressive and non-aggressive), we measure the activation frequency of each neuron, then apply masking and activation techniques to quantitatively evaluate changes in aggression by layer and by manipulation ratio. Experimental results show that, in all models, manipulating only a small number of neurons can increase aggression by up to 33%, and the effect is even more extreme when aggression neurons are concentrated in certain layers. Moreover, even models of the same scale exhibit nonlinear changes in aggression patterns, suggesting that simple external safety measures alone may not be sufficient for complete defense",

To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose constructing data from scratch using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We then exploit a set of CoT-aware approaches, including Thoughts Length Balance, Fine-grained DPO, and Joint Post-training Objective, to enhance SFT and RL on the MCTS data. We conducted evaluation on various benchmarks such as math (GSM8K, MATH, AIME). instruction-following (Multi-IF) and planning (Blocksworld), results demonstrate our CoT-aware approaches substantially improve the reasoning performance of distilled models compared to standard distilled models via reducing the hallucinations in long-time thinking",

    "abstract": "Text-to-audio (T2A) generation has achieved remarkable progress in generating a variety of audio outputs from language prompts. However, current state-of-the-art T2A models still struggle to satisfy human preferences for prompt-following and acoustic quality when generating complex multi-event audio. To improve the performance of the model in these high-level applications, we propose to enhance the basic capabilities of the model with AI feedback learning. First, we introduce fine-grained AI audio scoring pipelines to: 1) verify whether each event in the text prompt is present in the audio (Event Occurrence Score), 2) detect deviations in event sequences from the language description (Event Sequence Score), and 3) assess the overall acoustic and harmonic quality of the generated audio (Acoustic&Harmonic Quality). We evaluate these three automatic scoring pipelines and find that they correlate significantly better with human preferences than other evaluation metrics. This highlights their value as both feedback signals and evaluation metrics. Utilizing our robust scoring pipelines, we construct a large audio preference dataset, T2A-FeedBack, which contains 41k prompts and 249k audios, each accompanied by detailed scores. Moreover, we introduce T2A-EpicBench, a benchmark that focuses on long captions, multi-events, and story-telling scenarios, aiming to evaluate the advanced capabilities of T2A models. Finally, we demonstrate how T2A-FeedBack can enhance current state-of-the-art audio model.

In this paper, we propose a novel continual instruction tuning method based on Key-part Information Gain (KPIG). Our method computes the information gain on masked parts to dynamically replay data and refine the training objective, which enables LLMs to capture task-aware information relevant to the correct response and alleviate overfitting to general descriptions in instructions.

This study presents a pipeline for training a model to generate distractors that are more likely to be selected by students. First, we train a pairwise ranker to reason about students' misconceptions and assess the relative plausibility of two distractors. Using this model, we create a dataset of pairwise distractor ranks and then train a distractor generator via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate more plausible distractors. Experiments on computer science subjects (Python, DB, MLDL) demonstrate that our pairwise ranker effectively identifies students' potential misunderstandings and achieves ranking accuracy comparable to human experts.

    "abstract": "Hubness, the tendency for a few points to be among the nearest neighbours of a disproportionate number of other points, commonly arises when applying standard distance measures to high-dimensional data, often negatively impacting distance-based analysis. As autoregressive large language models (LLMs) operate on high-dimensional representations, we ask whether they are also affected by hubness. We first prove that the only large-scale representation comparison operation performed by LLMs, namely that between context and unembedding vectors to determine continuation probabilities, is not characterized by the concentration of distances phenomenon that typically causes the appearance of nuisance hubness. We then empirically show that this comparison still leads to a high degree of hubness, but the hubs in this case do not constitute a disturbance. They are rather the result of context-modulated frequent tokens often appearing in the pool of likely candidates for next token prediction. However, when other distances are used to compare LLM representations, we do not have the same theoretical guarantees, and, indeed, we see nuisance hubs appear. There are two main takeaways. First, hubness, while omnipresent in high-dimensional spaces, is not a negative property that needs to be mitigated when LLMs are being used for next token prediction. Second, when comparing representations from LLMs using Euclidean or cosine distance, there is a high risk of nuisance hubs and practitioners should use mitigation techniques if relevant",

    "title": "Capability Salience Vector: Fine-grained Alignment of Loss and Capabilities for Downstream Task Scaling Law",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Scaling law builds the relationship between training computation and validation loss, enabling researchers to effectively predict the loss trending of models across different levels of computation. However, a gap still remains between validation loss and the model's downstream capabilities, making it untrivial to apply scaling law to direct performance prediction for downstream tasks. The loss typically represents a cumulative penalty for predicted tokens, which are implicitly considered to have equal importance. Nevertheless, our studies have shown evidence that when considering different training data distributions, we cannot directly model the relationship between downstream capability and computation or token loss. To bridge the gap between validation loss and downstream task capabilities, in this work, we introduce Capability Salience Vector, which decomposes the overall loss and assigns different importance weights to tokens to assess a specific meta-capability, aligning the validation loss with downstream task performance in terms of the model's capabilities. Experiments on various popular benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Capability Salience Vector could significantly improve the predictability of language model performance on downstream tasks",

    "title": "CRUXEVAL-X: A Benchmark for Multilingual Code Reasoning, Understanding and Execution",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Code benchmarks such as HumanEval are widely adopted to evaluate Large Language Models' (LLMs) coding capabilities. However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks – over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs",

    "title": "Graph of Records: Boosting Retrieval Augmented Generation for Long-context Summarization with Graphs",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has revitalized Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting non-parametric factual knowledge. Compared with long-context LLMs, RAG is considered an effective summarization tool in a more concise and lightweight manner, which can interact with LLMs multiple times using diverse queries to get comprehensive responses. However, the LLM-generated historical responses, which contain potentially insightful information, are largely neglected and discarded by existing approaches, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose graph of records (GoR), which leverages historical responses generated by LLMs to enhance RAG for long-context global summarization. Inspired by the retrieve-then-generate paradigm of RAG, we construct a graph by establishing an edge between the retrieved text chunks and the corresponding LLM-generated response. To further uncover the intricate correlations between them, GoR features a graph neural network and an elaborately designed BERTScore-based objective for self-supervised model training, enabling seamless supervision signal backpropagation between reference summaries and node embeddings. We comprehensively compare GoR with 12 baselines across four long-context summarization datasets, and the results indicate that our proposed method reaches the best performance (e.g., 15%, 8%, and 19% improvement over retrievers w.r.t. Rouge-L, Rouge-1, and Rouge-2 on the WCEP dataset). Extensive experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of GoR",

Inspired by the dual-process theory in human cognition, we propose a Dual-Mind Negotiation Agent (DMNA) framework. This framework integrates an intuitive module for rapid, experience-based response and a deliberative module for slow, expression optimization. The intuitive module is trained using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling it to make suitable strategic planning and expression. The deliberative module employs a multifaceted reflexion mechanism to enhance the quality of expression. Experiments conducted on negotiation datasets confirm that DMNA achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating an enhancement in the negotiation ability of agents",

Among these, long-context referencing—a crucial task that requires LCLMs to attribute items of interest to specific parts of long-context data—remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes Referencing Evaluation for Long-context Language Models (Ref-Long), a novel benchmark designed to assess the long-context referencing capability of LCLMs. Specifically, Ref-Long requires LCLMs to identify the indexes of documents that reference a specific key, emphasizing contextual relationships between the key and the documents over simple retrieval. Based on the task design, we construct three subsets ranging from synthetic to realistic scenarios to form the Ref-Long benchmark. Experimental results of 13 LCLMs reveal significant shortcomings in long-context referencing, even among advanced models like GPT-4o. To further investigate these challenges, we conduct comprehensive analyses, including human evaluations, task format adjustments, fine-tuning experiments, and error analyses, leading to several key insights.

    "abstract": "Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerate—a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity",

    "abstract": "Identifying arguments is a necessary prerequisite for various tasks in automated discourse analysis, particularly within contexts such as political debates, online discussions, and scientific reasoning. In addition to theoretical advances in understanding the constitution of arguments, a significant body of research has emerged around practical argument mining, supported by a growing number of publicly available datasets. On these benchmarks, BERT-like transformers have consistently performed best, reinforcing the belief that such models are broadly applicable across diverse contexts of debate. This study offers the first large-scale re-evaluation of such state-of-the-art models, with a specific focus on their ability to generalize in identifying arguments. We evaluate four transformers, three standard and one enhanced with contrastive pre-training for better generalization, on 17 English sentence-level datasets as most relevant to the task. Our findings show that, to varying degrees, these models tend to rely on lexical shortcuts tied to content words, suggesting that apparent progress may often be driven by dataset-specific cues rather than true task alignment. While the models achieve strong results on familiar benchmarks, their performance drops markedly when applied to unseen datasets. Nonetheless, incorporating both task-specific pre-training and joint benchmark training proves effective in enhancing both robustness and generalization",

Through knowledge distillation, we transfer the semantic understanding capabilities from the visual-textual embedding model to a purely visual model, enabling efficient parsing-free retrieval while preserving semantic fidelity.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in tree search algorithms guided by verifiers have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but at the cost of increased computational resources. In this work, we identify two key challenges contributing to this inefficiency: over-exploration due to redundant states with semantically equivalent content, and under-exploration caused by high variance in verifier scoring leading to frequent trajectory switching. To address these issues, we propose FETCH – an e ffici ent tree sear ch framework, which is a flexible, plug-and-play system compatible with various tree search algorithms.Our framework mitigates over-exploration by merging semantically similar states using agglomerative clustering of text embeddings obtained from a fine-tuned SimCSE model. To tackle under-exploration, we enhance verifiers by incorporating temporal difference learning with adjusted 𝜆-returns during training to reduce variance, and employing a verifier ensemble to aggregate scores during inference. Experiments on GSM8K, GSM-Plus, and MATH datasets demonstrate that our methods significantly improve reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency across four different tree search algorithms, paving the way for more practical applications of LLM-based reasoning.

These risks can be amplified by the recent adversarial attacks, fine-tuning vulnerabilities, and the increasing deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments. Existing safety-enhancing techniques, such as fine-tuning with human feedback or adversarial training, are still vulnerable as they address specific threats and often fail to generalize across unseen attacks, or require manual system-level defenses. This paper introduces RepBend, a novel approach that fundamentally disrupts the representations underlying harmful behaviors in LLMs, offering a scalable solution to enhance (potentially inherent) safety. RepBend brings the idea of activation steering – simple vector arithmetic for steering model's behavior during inference – to loss-based fine-tuning. Through extensive evaluation, RepBend achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior methods such as Circuit Breaker, RMU, and NPO, with up to 95% reduction in attack success rates across diverse jailbreak benchmarks, all with negligible reduction in model usability and general capabilities",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "While understanding the knowledge boundaries of LLMs is crucial to prevent hallucination, research on the knowledge boundaries of LLMs has predominantly focused on English. In this work, we present the first study to analyze how LLMs recognize knowledge boundaries across different languages by probing their internal representations when processing known and unknown questions in multiple languages. Our empirical studies reveal three key findings: 1) LLMs' perceptions of knowledge boundaries are encoded in the middle to middle-upper layers across different languages. 2) Language differences in knowledge boundary perception follow a linear structure, which motivates our proposal of a training-free alignment method that effectively transfers knowledge boundary perception ability across languages, thereby helping reduce hallucination risk in low-resource languages; 3) Fine-tuning on bilingual question pair translation further enhances LLMs' recognition of knowledge boundaries across languages. Given the absence of standard testbeds for cross-lingual knowledge boundary analysis, we construct a multilingual evaluation suite comprising three representative types of knowledge boundary data.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding responses in external knowledge. However, in real-world applications, retrievers often return lengthy documents with redundant or irrelevant content, confusing downstream readers. While evidence retrieval aims to address this by extracting key information, it faces critical challenges: (1) inability to model synergistic inter-dependencies among evidence sentences, (2) lack of supervision for evaluating multi-sentence evidence quality, and (3) computational inefficiency in navigating exponentially growing search spaces of candidate evidence sets. To tackle these challenges, we propose ETS (Evidence Tree Search), a novel framework that reformulates evidence retrieval as a dynamic tree expansion process. Our approach first constructs an evidence tree where each path represents a candidate evidence set, explicitly modeling inter-sentence dependencies through context-aware node selection. We then leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently assess evidence quality and introduce an Early-Terminating Beam Search strategy to efficiently accelerate the model inference. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that ETS significantly outperforms existing methods across different readers. Our code and datasets will be released to facilitate future research",

A major challenge in benchmarking hallucinations is the lack of a unified framework due to inconsistent definitions and categorizations. We disentangle LLM hallucination from \"factuality\" and propose a taxonomy distinguishing extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations to promote consistency and facilitate research. We emphasize extrinsic hallucinations – where generated content deviates from training data – as they become increasingly relevant with LLM advancements. However, no benchmark is solely dedicated to extrinsic hallucinations. To address this gap, HalluLens introduces three new extrinsic tasks with dynamic test set generation to mitigate data leakage and ensure robustness.

To address this, we propose DEEPER, a novel approach for dynamic persona modeling that enables continual persona optimization.

However, these models are often evaluated on benchmarks that are unsuitable for the Med-MLLMs due to the intricate nature of the real-world diagnostic frameworks, which encompass diverse medical specialties and involve complex clinical decisions. Thus, a clinically representative benchmark is highly desirable for credible Med-MLLMs evaluation. To this end, we introduce Asclepius, a novel Med-MLLM benchmark that comprehensively assesses Med-MLLMs in terms of: distinct medical specialties (cardiovascular, gastroenterology, etc.) and different diagnostic capacities (perception, disease analysis, etc.). Grounded in 3 proposed core principles, Asclepius ensures a comprehensive evaluation by encompassing 15 medical specialties, stratifying into 3 main categories and 8 sub-categories of clinical tasks, and exempting overlap with the existing VQA dataset. We further provide an in-depth analysis of 6 Med-MLLMs and compare them with 3 human specialists, providing insights into their competencies and limitations in various medical contexts. Our work not only advances the understanding of Med-MLLMs' capabilities but also sets a precedent for future evaluations and the safe deployment of these models in clinical environments",

However, many of these models perceive objects as indivisible, overlooking the components that constitute them. Understanding these components and their associated affordances provides valuable insights into an object's functionality, which is fundamental for performing a wide range of tasks. In this work, we introduce a novel real-world benchmark, InstructPart, comprising hand-labeled part segmentation annotations and task-oriented instructions to evaluate the performance of current models in understanding and executing part-level tasks within everyday contexts. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that task-oriented part segmentation remains a challenging problem, even for state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In addition to our benchmark, we introduce a simple baseline that achieves a twofold performance improvement through fine-tuning with our dataset.

    "abstract": "Stochastically sampling word segmentations from a subword tokeniser, also called subword regularisation, is a known way to increase robustness of language models to out-of-distribution inputs, such as text containing spelling errors. Recent work has observed that usual augmentations that make popular deterministic subword tokenisers stochastic still cause only a handful of all possible segmentations to be sampled. It has been proposed to uniformly sample across these instead, through rejection sampling of paths in an unweighted segmentation graph. In this paper, we argue that uniformly random segmentation in turn skews the distributions of certain segmentational properties (e.g. token lengths and amount of tokens produced) away from uniformity, which still ends up hiding meaningfully diverse tokenisations. We propose an alternative uniform sampler using the same segmentation graph, but weighted by counting the paths through it. Our sampling algorithm, GRaMPa, provides hyperparameters allowing sampled tokenisations to skew towards fewer, longer tokens. Furthermore, GRaMPa is single-pass, guaranteeing significantly better computational complexity than previous approaches relying on rejection sampling. We show experimentally that language models trained with GRaMPa outperform existing regularising tokenisers in a data-scarce setting on token-level tasks such as dependency parsing, especially with spelling errors present",

Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics. Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of their outputs",

    "abstract": "The spread of fake news on online platforms has long been a pressing concern. Considering this, extensive efforts have been made to develop fake news detectors. However, a major drawback of these models is their relatively low performance—lagging by more than 20%—in identifying *fake* news compared to *real* news, making them less suitable for practical deployment. This gap is likely due to an imbalance in the dataset and the model's inadequate understanding of data distribution on the targeted platform. In this work, we focus on improving the model's effectiveness in detecting *fake* news. To achieve this, we **first** adopt an LLM to **generate** fake news in three different styles, which are later incorporated into the training set to augment the representation of fake news. **Then**, we apply Reinforcement Learning to dynamically **sample** fake news, allowing the model to learn the optimal real-to-fake news ratio for training an effective fake news detector on the targeted platform. This approach allows our model to perform effectively even with a limited amount of annotated news data and consistently improve detection accuracy across different platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, improving *fake* news detection performance by 24.02% and 11.06% respectively",

However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for developing reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present ChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical executor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured action sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to address the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This framework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on distribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate machine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we introduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the model's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive experiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A) tasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

This paper explores leveraging LLMs' internal states to enhance their perception of knowledge boundaries from efficiency and risk perspectives. We investigate whether LLMs can estimate their confidence using internal states before response generation, potentially saving computational resources. Our experiments on datasets like Natural Questions, HotpotQA, and MMLU reveal that LLMs demonstrate significant pre-generation perception, which is further refined post-generation, with perception gaps remaining stable across varying conditions. To mitigate risks in critical domains, we introduce Consistency-based Confidence Calibration (C3), which assesses confidence consistency through question reformulation. C3 significantly improves LLMs' ability to recognize their knowledge gaps, enhancing the unknown perception rate by 5.6% on NQ and 4.9% on HotpotQA. Our findings suggest that pre-generation confidence estimation can optimize efficiency, while C3 effectively controls output risks, advancing the reliability of LLMs in practical applications",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases, private textual data is increasingly processed and stored as numerical embeddings. However, recent studies have proven that such embeddings are vulnerable to inversion attacks, where original text is reconstructed to reveal sensitive information. Previous research has largely assumed access to millions of sentences to train attack models, e.g., through data leakage or nearly unrestricted API access. With our method, a single data point is sufficient for a partially successful inversion attack. With as little as 1k data samples, performance reaches an optimum across a range of black-box encoders, without training on leaked data. We present a Few-shot Textual Embedding Inversion Attack using Cross-Model **AL**ignment and **GEN**eration (__ALGEN__), by aligning victim embeddings to the attack space and using a generative model to reconstruct text. We find that __ALGEN__ attacks can be effectively transferred across domains and languages, revealing key information. We further examine a variety of defense mechanisms against **ALGEN**, and find that none are effective, highlighting the vulnerabilities posed by inversion attacks. By significantly lowering the cost of inversion and proving that embedding spaces can be aligned through one-step optimization, we establish a new textual embedding inversion paradigm with broader applications for embedding alignment in NLP",

Existing research on the utilization of KG for large language models (LLMs) prevalently relies on subgraph retriever or iterative prompting, overlooking the potential synergy of LLMs' step-wise reasoning capabilities and KGs' structural nature. In this paper, we present DoG (Decoding on Graph), a novel framework that facilitates a deep synergy between LLMs and KGs. We first define a concept, well-formed chain, which consists of a sequence of interrelated fact triplets on the KGs, starting from question entities and leading to answers. We argue that this concept can serve as a principle for making faithful and sound reasoning for KGQA. To enable LLMs to generate well-formed chains, we propose graph-aware constrained decoding, in which a constraint derived from the topology of the KG regulates the decoding process of the LLMs. This constrained decoding method ensures the generation of well-formed chains while making full use of the step-wise reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Based on the above, DoG, a training-free approach, is able to provide faithful and sound reasoning trajectories grounded on the KGs. Experiments across various KGQA tasks with different background KGs demonstrate that DoG achieves superior and robust performance. DoG also shows general applicability with various open-source LLMs",

However, applying such techniques to structured tasks, such as text-to-SQL, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Self-Taught Reasoner for text-to-SQL (STaR-SQL), a novel approach that reframes SQL query generation as a reasoning-driven process. Our method prompts the LLM to produce detailed reasoning steps for SQL queries and fine-tunes it on rationales that lead to correct outcomes. Unlike traditional methods, STaR-SQL dedicates additional test-time computation to reasoning, thereby positioning LLMs as spontaneous reasoners rather than mere prompt-based agents. To further scale the inference process, we incorporate an outcome-supervised reward model (ORM) as a verifier, which enhances SQL query accuracy. Experimental results on the challenging Spider benchmark demonstrate that STaR-SQL significantly improves text-to-SQL performance, achieving an execution accuracy of 86.6%. This surpasses a few-shot baseline by 31.6% and a baseline fine-tuned to predict answers directly by 18.0%. Additionally, STaR-SQL outperforms agent-like prompting methods that leverage more powerful yet closed-source models such as GPT-4.

    "abstract": "Synthetic high-quality multi-step reasoning data can significantly enhance the performance of large language models on various tasks. However, most existing methods rely on rejection sampling, which generates trajectories independently and suffers from inefficiency and imbalanced sampling across problems of varying difficulty. In this work, we introduce FastMCTS, an innovative data synthesis strategy inspired by Monte Carlo Tree Search. FastMCTS provides a more efficient sampling method for multi-step reasoning data, offering step-level evaluation signals and promoting balanced sampling across problems of different difficulty levels. Experiments on both English and Chinese reasoning datasets demonstrate that FastMCTS generates over 30% more correct reasoning paths compared to rejection sampling as the number of generated tokens scales up. Furthermore, under comparable synthetic data budgets, models trained on FastMCTS-generated data outperform those trained on rejection sampling data by 3.9% across multiple benchmarks. As a lightweight sampling strategy, FastMCTS offers a practical and efficient alternative for synthesizing high-quality reasoning data",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have demonstrated significant potential on tasks across multiple domains. However, ellipses and coreferences, as common phenomena in dialogue scenes, pose challenges to LLMs' understanding and RAG's retrieval accuracy. The previous works ignore the negative impact of this fuzzy data on RAG system.We explore the capabilities of LLMs and RAG systems in dialogue scenarios and use Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) to complete the key information in dialogue to enhance retrieval.Besides, we propose a lightweight IUR model for query rewriting. It is an end-to-end framework for node linking and iterative inference, incorporating two newly proposed probing semantic features derived from generative pre-training. This framework treats IUR as a series of link decisions on the input sequence and the incrementally constructed rewriting outputs.To test the performance of RAG system in the model multi-round dialogue scenario, we construct an RAG dialogue dataset on English and Chinese, Dialogue-RAG-MULTI-v1.0.Experiment results show that utterance rewriting can effectively improve the retrieval and generation ability of RAG system in dialogue scenes.

    "abstract": "This paper argues that the relationship between lexical identity and prosody—one well-studied parameter of linguistic variation—can be characterized using information theory. We predict that languages that use prosody to make lexical distinctions should exhibit a higher mutual information between word identity and prosody, compared to languages that don't. We test this hypothesis in the domain of pitch, which is used to make lexical distinctions in tonal languages, like Cantonese. We use a dataset of speakers reading sentences aloud in ten languages across five language families to estimate the mutual information between the text and their pitch curves. We find that, across languages, pitch curves display similar amounts of entropy. However, these curves are easier to predict given their associated text in the tonal languages, compared to pitch- and stress-accent languages, and thus the mutual information is higher in these languages, supporting our hypothesis. Our results support perspectives that view linguistic typology as gradient, rather than categorical",

We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised auxiliary tasks for morphological inflection – a character-level task highly relevant for language documentation – in extremely low-resource settings, training encoder-decoder transformers for 19 languages and 13 auxiliary objectives. Autoencoding yields the best performance when unlabeled data is very limited, while character masked language modeling (CMLM) becomes more effective as data availability increases. Though objectives with stronger inductive biases influence model predictions intuitively, they rarely outperform standard CMLM. However, sampling masks based on known morpheme boundaries consistently improves performance, highlighting a promising direction for low-resource morphological modeling",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300× in real-time processing on large-scale datasets.

The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are known to suffer from severe hallucination issues. One of the main causes lies in the knowledge misalignment between the pre-training stage and the supervised fine-tuning stage. The unfamiliar knowledge encountered during fine-tuning may encourage LLMs to generate facts that are not grounded in parametric knowledge. To address this, we propose Seal, a novel training objective with an abstention mechanism, in which the model learns to selectively reject tokens that misalign with the desired knowledge distribution via a special [REJ] token. This allows the model the option of acknowledging the insufficiency of knowledge rather than blindly assigning high probability to all ground-truth answers. We further propose a regularized decoding objective that penalizes uncertain predictions during inference by using the [REJ] probability learned during training. Extensive experiments on six short-form and long-form QA datasets with three LLMs of different sizes demonstrate that our method effectively alleviates hallucinations caused by knowledge misalignment. Further analysis highlights the adaptations of our method in answer refusal scenarios and its ability to effectively maintain the model's instruction-following capabilities",

We introduce ReSpect, a method to learn from such signals in past interactions via retrospection without additional annotations. We deploy ReSpect in a new multimodal interaction scenario, where humans instruct a multimodal LLM to solve an abstract reasoning task with a combinatorial solution space.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth.

Thus, a natural question is, would LLMs have similar performance in real world coding tasks as their performance in these benchmarks? Unfortunately, one cannot answer this question, since these benchmarks consist of short completions, synthetic examples, or focus on limited scale repositories, failing to represent real-world coding tasks.To address these challenges, we create RepoCod, a Python code-generation benchmark containing complex tasks with realistic dependencies in real-world large projects and appropriate metrics for evaluating source code. It includes 980 whole-function generation tasks from 11 popular projects, 50.8% of which require repository-level context. RepoCod includes 314 developer-written test cases per instance for better evaluation. We evaluate ten LLMs on RepoCod and find that none achieves more than 30% pass@1 on RepoCod, indicating the necessity of building stronger LLMs that can help developers in real-world software development.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Safety concerns in large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their exposure to potentially harmful data during pre-training. In this paper, we identify a new safety vulnerability in LLMs: their susceptibility to natural distribution shifts between attack prompts and original toxic prompts, where seemingly benign prompts, semantically related to harmful content, can bypass safety mechanisms. To explore this issue, we introduce a novel attack method, ActorBreaker, which identifies actors related to toxic prompts within pre-training distribution to craft multi-turn prompts that gradually lead LLMs to reveal unsafe content. ActorBreaker is grounded in Latour's actor-network theory, encompassing both human and non-human actors to capture a broader range of vulnerabilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that ActorBreaker outperforms existing attack methods in terms of diversity, effectiveness, and efficiency across aligned LLMs. To address this vulnerability, we propose expanding safety training to cover a broader semantic space of toxic content. We thus construct a multi-turn safety dataset using ActorBreaker. Fine-tuning models on our dataset shows significant improvements in robustness, though with some trade-offs in utility.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating source code, two major challenges persist in UI-to-HTML code generation: (1) effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs, and (2) bridging the gap between the visual nature of UI designs and the text-based format of HTML code. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Waffle, a new fine-tuning strategy that uses a structure-aware attention mechanism to improve LLMs' understanding of HTML's structure and a contrastive fine-tuning approach to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code. Models fine-tuned with Waffle show up to 9.00 pp (percentage point) higher HTML match, 0.0982 higher CW-SSIM, 32.99 higher CLIP, and 27.12 pp higher LLEM on our new benchmark WebSight-Test and an existing benchmark Design2Code, outperforming current fine-tuning methods",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Math reasoning is an active area of Large Language Model (LLM) research because it is a hallmark of artificial intelligence and has implications in several domains, including math education. However, few works have explored how math reasoning is encoded within LLM parameters and if it is a skill that can be isolated within models. Doing so could allow targeted intervention to improve math performance without altering non-math behavior and foster understanding of how models encode math reasoning. We introduce Math Neurosurgery (MathNeuro), a computationally efficient method we use to isolate math-specific parameters in LLMs using only forward passes. MathNeuro builds on existing work by using weights and activations to calculate parameter importance, but isolates math-specific parameters by filtering out those important for general language tasks. Through pruning parameters MathNeuro identifies, we delete a LLM's math reasoning ability without significantly impacting its general language ability. Scaling the identified parameters by a small constant improves a pretrained or instruction-tuned LLM's performance by 4-17% on GSM8K and 5-35% on MATH while leaving non-math behavior unaltered. MathNeuro is also data efficient: most of its effectiveness holds when identifying math-specific parameters using a single sample. MathNeuro highlights the potential for future work to intervene on math-specific parameters",

While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters)",

    "abstract": "Generating long sequences of tokens given a long-context input is a very compute-intensive inference scenario for large language models (LLMs). One prominent inference speed-up approach is constructing a smaller key-value (KV) cache, relieving LLMs from computing attention over a long sequence of tokens. While such methods work well to generate short sequences, their performance degrades rapidly for long-form generation. Most KV compression happens once, prematurely removing tokens that can be useful later in the generation. We propose a new inference-time method, RefreshKV, that flexibly alternates between full context attention and attention over a subset of input tokens during generation. After each full attention step, we update the smaller KV cache based on the attention pattern over the entire input. Applying our method to off-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to eviction-based methods while improving performance for various long-form generation tasks. Lastly, we show that continued pretraining with our inference setting brings further gains in performance",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities. While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge.

CoR generates multiple potential answers using different reasoning paradigms and synthesizes them into a coherent final solution. We propose a Progressive Paradigm Training (PPT) strategy that allows models to progressively master these paradigms, culminating in the development of at CoR-Math-7B. Experimental results demonstrate that CoR-Math-7B significantly outperforms current SOTA models, achieving up to a 41.0% absolute improvement over GPT-4o in theorem proving tasks and a 15% improvement over RL-based methods on the MATH benchmark in arithmetic tasks.

Various factors, such as word frequency, recency bias in attention, and context size, have been theorized to affect PPP, yet there is no current account that explains why such a tipping point exists, and how it interacts with LMs' pretraining dynamics more generally. We hypothesize that the underlying factor is a pretraining phase transition, characterized by the rapid emergence of specialized attention heads. We conduct a series of correlational and causal experiments to show that such a phase transition is responsible for the tipping point in PPP. We then show that, rather than producing attention patterns that contribute to the degradation in PPP, phase transitions alter the subsequent learning dynamics of the model, such that further training keeps damaging PPP",

Through systematic evaluation using MC-SIGNS, we uncover critical limitations: text-to-image (T2I) systems exhibit strong US-centric biases, performing better at detecting offensive gestures in US contexts than in non-US ones; large language models (LLMs) tend to over-flag gestures as offensive; and vision-language models (VLMs) default to US-based interpretations when responding to universal concepts like wishing someone luck, frequently suggesting culturally inappropriate gestures.

To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses natural language contexts into a minimum of one special token and demonstrates strong generalization ability. The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 500x, achieving 27-90% reduction in calculations and 55-83% memory savings when generating 100-400 tokens for new and reused prompts at 500x compression, while retaining 70-74% (F1) and 77-84% (Exact Match) of the LLM capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and can be utilized by the original LLM without requiring fine-tuning. Initially, 500xCompressor was pretrained on the ArxivCorpus, followed by fine-tuning on the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and cross-domain question answering (QA) datasets.

However, the contextual knowledge can contain private information that may be leaked when answering queries, and estimating this privacy leakage is not well understood. A straightforward approach of directly comparing an LM's output to the contexts can overestimate the privacy risk, since the LM's parametric knowledge might already contain the augmented contextual knowledge. To this end, we introduce context influence, a metric that builds on differential privacy, a widely-adopted privacy notion, to estimate the privacy leakage of contextual knowledge during decoding. Our approach effectively measures how each subset of the context influences an LM's response while separating the specific parametric knowledge of the LM. Using our context influence metric, we demonstrate that context privacy leakage occurs when contextual knowledge is out of distribution with respect to parametric knowledge. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate how context influence properly attributes the privacy leakage to augmented contexts, and we evaluate how factors– such as model size, context size, generation position, etc.– affect context privacy leakage. The practical implications of our results will inform practitioners of the privacy risk associated with augmented contextual knowledge",

Leveraging \\mathtt{MuMOInstruct}, we develop \\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s, a series of instruction-tuned LLMs for molecule optimization. Extensive evaluations across 5 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain tasks demonstrate that \\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines. \\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s also exhibit outstanding zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, significantly outperforming powerful closed-source LLMs. Such strong generalizability demonstrates the tremendous potential of \\mathtt{GeLLM^3O}s as foundational models for molecule optimization, thereby tackling novel optimization tasks without resource-intensive retraining. \\mathtt{MuMOInstruct} and code are accessible through https://github.com/ninglab/GeLLMO",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Follow-up question generation is an essential feature of dialogue systems as it can reduce conversational ambiguity and enhance modeling complex interactions. Conversational contexts often pose core NLP challenges such as (i) extracting relevant information buried in fragmented data sources, and (ii) modeling parallel thought processes. These two challenges occur frequently in medical dialogue as a doctor asks questions based not only on patient utterances but also their prior EHR data and current diagnostic hypotheses. Asking medical questions in asynchronous conversations compounds these issues as doctors can only rely on static EHR information to motivate follow-up questions. To address these challenges, we introduce FollowupQ, a novel framework for enhancing asynchronous medical conversation.FollowupQ is a multi-agent framework that processes patient messages and EHR data to generate personalized follow-up questions, clarifying patient-reported medical conditions. FollowupQ reduces requisite provider follow-up communications by 34%. It also improves performance by 17% and 5% on real and synthetic data, respectively. We also release the first public dataset of asynchronous medical messages with linked EHR data alongside 2,300 follow-up questions written by clinical experts for the wider NLP research community",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Quality estimation (QE)—the automatic assessment of translation quality—has recently become crucial across several stages of the translation pipeline, from data curation to training and decoding. While QE metrics have been optimized to align with human judgments, whether they encode social biases has been largely overlooked. Biased QE risks favoring certain demographic groups over others, e.g., by exacerbating gaps in visibility and usability. This paper defines and investigates gender bias of QE metrics and discusses its downstream implications for machine translation (MT). Experiments with state-of-the-art QE metrics across multiple domains, datasets, and languages reveal significant bias. When a human entity's gender in the source is undisclosed, masculine-inflected translations score higher than feminine-inflected ones, and gender-neutral translations are penalized. Even when contextual cues disambiguate gender, using context-aware QE metrics leads to more errors in selecting the correct translation inflection for feminine referents than for masculine ones. Moreover, a biased QE metric affects data filtering and quality-aware decoding. Our findings underscore the need for a renewed focus on developing and evaluating QE metrics centered on gender",

    "abstract": "Multimodal summarization (MS) combines text and visuals to generate summaries. Recently, many-to-many multimodal summarization (M3S) garnered interest as it enables a unified model for multilingual and cross-lingual MS. Existing methods have made progress by facilitating the transfer of common multimodal summarization knowledge. While, prior M3S models that fully share parameters neglect the language-specific knowledge learning, where potential interference between languages may limit the flexible adaptation of MS modes across different language combinations and hinder further collaborative improvements in joint M3S training. Based on this observation, we propose Language Constrained Multimodal Hyper Adapter (LCMHA) for M3S. LCMHA integrates language-specific multimodal adapters into multilingual pre-trained backbones via a language constrained hypernetwork, enabling relaxed parameter sharing that enhances language-specific learning while preserving shared MS knowledge learning. In addition, a language-regularized hypernetwork is designed to balance intra- and inter-language learning, generating language-specific adaptation weights and enhancing the retention of distinct language features through the regularization of generated parameters. Experimental results on the M3Sum benchmark show LCMHA's effectiveness and scalability across multiple multilingual pre-trained backbones",

Since language models are prone to various types of errors during the reasoning process, PRMs are required to possess nuanced capabilities for detecting various implicit error types in real-world scenarios. However, current benchmarks primarily focus on step correctness, failing to evaluate PRMs' performance systematically. To address this gap, we introduce PRMBench, a process-level benchmark specifically designed to assess the fine-grained error detection capabilities of PRMs. PRMBench comprises 6,216 carefully designed problems and 83,456 step-level labels, evaluating models across multiple dimensions, including simplicity, soundness, and sensitivity. In our experiments on 25 models, spanning both open-source PRMs and closed-source large language models prompted as critic models, we uncover significant weaknesses in current PRMs. These findings underscore the challenges inherent in process-level evaluation and highlight key directions for future research, establishing PRMBench as a robust testbed for advancing research on PRM evaluation and development",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "This paper develops an ensemble method for fine-tuning a language model to multiple datasets. Existing methods, such as quantized LoRA (QLoRA), are efficient when adapting to a single dataset. When training on multiple datasets of different tasks, a common setup in practice, it remains unclear how to design an efficient adaptation for fine-tuning language models. We propose to use an ensemble of multiple smaller adapters instead of a single adapter per task. We design an efficient algorithm that partitions n datasets into m groups, where m is typically much smaller than n in practice, and train one adapter for each group before taking a weighted combination to form the ensemble. The algorithm leverages a first-order approximation property of low-rank adaptation to quickly obtain the fine-tuning performances of dataset combinations since methods like LoRA stay close to the base model. Hence, we use the gradients of the base model to estimate its behavior during fine-tuning. Empirically, this approximation holds with less than 1% error on models with up to 34 billion parameters, leading to an estimation of true fine-tuning performances under 5% error while speeding up computation compared to base fine-tuning by 105 times. When applied to fine-tune Llama and GPT models on ten text classification tasks, our approach provides up to 10% higher average test accuracy over QLoRA, with only 9% more FLOPs. On a Llama model with 34 billion parameters, an ensemble of QLoRA increases test accuracy by 3% compared to QLoRA, with only 8% more FLOPs",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of the self-referencing causal cycle (abbreviated ReCall )—a mechanism that enables large language models (LLMs) to bypass the limitations of unidirectional causality, which underlies a phenomenon known as the reversal curse. When an LLM is prompted with sequential data, it often fails to recall preceding context. For example, when we ask an LLM to recall the line preceding \"O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave\" in the U.S. National Anthem, it often fails to correctly return \"Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there\"—this is due to the reversal curse. It occurs because language models such as ChatGPT and Llama generate text based on preceding tokens, requiring facts to be learned and reproduced in a consistent token order. While the reversal curse is often viewed as a limitation, we offer evidence of an alternative view: it is not always an obstacle in practice. We find that ReCall is driven by what we designate as cycle tokens—sequences that connect different parts of the training data, enabling recall of preceding tokens from succeeding ones. Through rigorous probabilistic formalization and controlled experiments, we demonstrate how the cycles they induce influence a model's ability to reproduce information. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide our code and experimental details at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/remember-B0B8/",

    "abstract": "Jailbreaking in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major security concern as it can deceive LLMs into generating harmful text. However, understanding of how jailbreaking works remains limited, hindering the development of effective defense strategies. To address this issue, we conduct a large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and identify that disagreements among methods stem from insufficient observation samples.We introduce the concept of a safety boundary and discover that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside this boundary, where LLMs become less sensitive to harmful information. Our analysis reveals that low and middle layers play a critical role in these shifts, while deeper layers have a lesser impact.Building on these insights, we propose a novel defense mechanism called Activation Boundary Defense (ABD), which adaptively constrains activations within the safety boundary. To enhance its effectiveness, we use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense to the low and middle layers.Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ABD achieves an average Defense Success Rate (DSR) of over 98% against various jailbreak attacks, with less than a 2% impact on the model's general capabilities",

This framework incorporates emotion contagion to augment emotional expressiveness and employs an emotion-reasoning mask to pinpoint critical emotional elements. Additionally, it integrates intent mimicry within reinforcement learning for refinement during diffusion. By harnessing an intent twice reflect mechanism of Exploring-Sampling-Correcting, ReflectDiffu adeptly translates emotional decision-making into precise intent actions, thereby addressing empathetic response misalignments stemming from emotional misrecognition. Through reflection, the framework maps emotional states to intents, markedly enhancing both response empathy and flexibility.

In this work, we propose Salience-Aware Reinforced Adaptive decoding (SARA), which incorporates salient information and allows the model to adaptively determine reliance on the source document's context, salient context, and the model's prior knowledge based on pointwise mutual information. Moreover, a tokenwise adaptive decoding mechanism via reinforcement learning is proposed in SARA to dynamically adjust the contributions of context and prior knowledge at each decoding timestep.

The proposed approach achieves 100 times faster and cheaper computations in real-world applications. Experiments show that Embedding-Converter not only streamlines transitions to new models, but can also improve upon the source model's performance, approaching that of the target model. This facilitates efficient evaluation and broader adoption of new embedding models by significantly reducing the overhead of model switching. Furthermore, Embedding-Converter addresses latency limitations by enabling the use of smaller models for online tasks while still benefiting from the performance of larger models offline. By promoting the release of converters alongside new embedding models, Embedding-Converter fosters a more dynamic and accessible ecosystem for embedding model development and deployment",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However, evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications. This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on a new task of answering geographic reasoning questions based on the given image (called GeoVQA). Unlike traditional VQA tasks, GeoVQA asks for details about the image-related culture, landscape, etc. This requires not only the identification of the objects in the image, their properties and relations, but also the understanding of the geographic knowledge of the objects, such as location, transportation, landmark, cuisine, etc. This background knowledge does not explicitly appear in the image, nor is there an extra-textual description. Without this missing but necessary knowledge, it is difficult for existing matching-based methods to infer the correct answer. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new geographic reasoning framework for our task. We first analyze the image and describe its fine-grained content by text and keywords using a multi-modal retrieval augmented technique, so as to deduce an answer in a unified textual modality. Next, we retrieve the crucial geographic commonsense knowledge. To reduce the retrieval complexity, we design a dynamic method that can adaptively collect the relevant clues for each reasoning step. The step in the incorrect direction will be pruned according to some judgment criteria. The remaining steps can help us form a reasoning chain to derive a correct answer. Moreover, we create a large-scale dataset GVQA with 41,329 samples to conduct the evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach",

CKU works by scoring neurons in specific multilayer perceptron (MLP) layers to identify a subset U of neurons associated with useful knowledge. During the unlearning process, CKU prunes the gradients of neurons in U to preserve valuable knowledge while effectively mitigating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that CKU significantly enhances model safety without compromising overall performance, offering a superior balance between safety and utility compared to existing methods.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a recently proposed pre-training objective for language models. Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next *k* tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits",

    "abstract": "Large language models excel at problem-solving but often struggle with complex reasoning and factual accuracy. While chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation help break down problems and retrieve knowledge, they still falter on challenging tasks like competitive programming due to frequent reasoning errors and irrelevant retrieval. To address this, we introduce Critic-guided planning with Retrieval-augmentation, CR-Planner, a novel framework that leverages fine-tuned critic models to guide both reasoning and retrieval processes through planning. CR-Planner iteratively selects and executes sub-goals, guided by critic models. A sub-goal critic identifies promising sub-goals from reasoning, query generation, and retrieval, while an execution critic evaluates outputs of sub-goal executions. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect data for critic training, allowing systematic exploration of action sequences and effective navigation toward the final answer. We evaluate CR-Planner on challenging domain-knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy tasks, including competitive programming, theorem-driven math reasoning, and complex domain retrieval problems. It significantly outperforms baselines, demonstrating effectiveness in both reasoning and retrieval",

This paper delves into long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot ICL. We first ask: what types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and how effective are they in evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and summarization tasks show performance improvements with additional demonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear trends. Next, we investigate the extent to which different tasks necessitate retrieval versus global context understanding. We develop metrics to categorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) similar-sample learning (SSL): tasks where retrieval of the most similar examples is sufficient for good performance, and (ii) all-sample learning (ASL): tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of all examples in the prompt. Lastly, we introduce a new many-shot ICL benchmark built on existing ICL tasks, MANYICLBENCH, to characterize model's ability on both fronts and benchmark 12 LCLMs using MANYICLBENCH. We find that while state-of-the-art models demonstrate good performance up to 64k tokens in SSL tasks, many models experience significant performance drops at only 16k tokens in ASL tasks",

    "abstract": "Inference-Time Scaling has been critical to the success of recent models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1. However, many techniques used to train models for inference-time scaling require tasks to have answers that can be verified, limiting their application to domains such as math, coding and logical reasoning. We take inspiration from how humans make first attempts, ask for detailed feedback from others and make improvements based on such feedback across a wide spectrum of open-ended endeavors. To this end, we collect HelpSteer3 data to train dedicated Feedback and Edit Models that are capable of performing inference-time scaling for open-ended general-domain tasks. In our setup, one model generates an initial response, which are given feedback by a second model, that are then used by a third model to edit the response. We show that performance on Arena Hard, a benchmark strongly predictive of Chatbot Arena Elo can be boosted by scaling the number of initial response drafts, effective feedback and edited responses. When scaled optimally, our setup based on 70B models from the Llama 3 family can reach SoTA performance on Arena Hard at 92.7 as of 5 Mar 2025, surpassing OpenAI o1-preview-2024-09-12 with 90.4 and DeepSeek R1 with 92.3",

Questions are each verified by five independent annotators and span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquette. We construct CulturalBench using methods inspired by Human-AI Red-Teaming. Compared to human performance (92.4% accuracy), the hard version of CulturalBench is challenging even for the best-performing frontier LMs, ranging from 28.7% to 61.5% in accuracy. We find that LMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to overfit to a single answer. Our results indicate that GPT-4o substantially outperform other models across cultures, besting local providers (e.g., Mistral on European culture and DeepSeek on Chinese culture).

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Post-training of Large Language Models often involves a pipeline of Supervised Finetuning (SFT) followed by Preference Finetuning (PFT) using methods like Direct Preference Optimization. Both stages require annotated data that are very different in structure and costs. We study how to optimally allocate a fixed training data budget between the two stages, through extensive experiments spanning four diverse tasks, multiple model sizes and various data annotation costs. Our findings reveal that just SFT on the base model dominates performance in low-data regimes (<1,000 annotated examples). With larger data-budgets, we observe that a combination of SFT and PFT, often with increasing portions allocated towards preference data yields optimal performance. However, completely eliminating SFT and running PFT directly on the base model yields suboptimal performance, described as the cold start problem on tasks like mathematics. We observe that this is due to the distribution shift arising from using DPO directly on the base model to elicit step-by-step reasoning. This limitation can be effectively addressed by allocating even a small portion (<10%) of the budget to SFT first, resulting in performance improvements of 15-20% on analytical benchmarks like GSM8k. These results provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners optimizing model development under budget constraints, where high-quality data curation often represents a significant portion of the total costs of model development",

Concerningly, the experts identify 24% of the 50 evaluated research documents to be either paraphrased (with one-to-one methodological mapping), or significantly borrowed from existing work. These reported instances are cross-verified by authors of the source papers. Experts find an additional 32% ideas to partially overlap with prior work, and a small fraction to be completely original. Problematically, these LLM-generated research documents do not acknowledge original sources, and bypass inbuilt plagiarism detectors.

This work has largely progressed without a shared conception of culture, instead choosing to rely on a wide array of cultural proxies. However, this leads to a number of recurring limitations: coarse national boundaries fail to capture nuanced differences that lay within them, limited coverage restricts datasets to only a subset of usually highly-represented cultures, and a lack of dynamicity results in static cultural benchmarks that do not change as culture evolves. In this position paper, we argue that these methodological limitations are symptomatic of a theoretical gap. We draw on a well-developed theory of culture from sociocultural linguistics to fill this gap by 1) demonstrating in a case study how it can clarify methodological constraints and affordances, 2) offering theoretically-motivated paths forward to achieving cultural competence, and 3) arguing that localization is a more useful framing for the goals of much current work in cultural NLP",

However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce intention-informed auditory scene understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

    "abstract": "Should LLMs generate language that makes them seem human? Human-like language might improve user experience, but might also lead to deception, overreliance, and stereotyping. Assessing these potential impacts requires a systematic way to measure human-like tone in LLM outputs. We introduce HumT and SocioT, metrics for human-like tone and other dimensions of social perceptions in text data based on relative probabilities from an LLM. By measuring HumT across preference and usage datasets, we find that users prefer less human-like outputs from LLMs in many contexts. HumT also offers insights into the perceptions and impacts of anthropomorphism: human-like LLM outputs are highly correlated with warmth, social closeness, femininity, and low status, which are closely linked to the aforementioned harms. We introduce DumT, a method using HumT to systematically control and reduce the degree of human-like tone while preserving model performance. DumT offers a practical approach for mitigating risks associated with anthropomorphic language generation",

However, standard benchmarks, such as MMLU, measure LLM capabilities in isolation (i.e., \"AI-alone\"). Here, we design and conduct a user study to convert MMLU questions into user-AI conversations, by seeding the user with the question and having them carry out a conversation with the LLM to answer their question. We release ChatBench, a new dataset with AI-alone, user-alone, and user-AI data for 396 questions and two LLMs, including 144K answers and 7,336 user-AI conversations. We find that AI-alone accuracy fails to predict user-AI accuracy, with significant differences across multiple subjects (math, physics, and moral reasoning), and we analyze the user-AI conversations to provide insight into how they diverge from AI-alone benchmarks. Finally, we show that fine-tuning a user simulator on a subset of ChatBench improves its ability to estimate user-AI accuracies, increasing correlation on held-out questions by more than 20 points, creating possibilities for scaling interactive evaluation",

    "title": "Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on Distilled Preferences",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality.

    "abstract": "Do language models (LMs) offer insights into human language learning? A common argument against this idea is that because their architecture and training paradigm are so vastly different from humans, LMs can learn arbitrary inputs as easily as natural languages. We test this claim by training LMs to model impossible and typologically unattested languages.Unlike previous work, which has focused exclusively on English, we conduct experiments on 12 languages from 4 language families with two newly constructed parallel corpora. Our results show that while GPT-2 small can largely distinguish attested languages from their impossible counterparts, it does not achieve perfect separation between all the attested languages and all the impossible ones. We further test whether GPT-2 small distinguishes typologically attested from unattested languages with different NP orders by manipulating word order based on Greenberg's Universal 20. We find that the model's perplexity scores do not distinguish attested vs. unattested word orders, while its performance on the generalization test does. These findings suggest that LMs exhibit some human-like inductive biases, though these biases are weaker than those found in human learners",

    "abstract": "Evaluating large language model (LLM) is a complex task. Pairwise ranking has emerged as state-of-the-art method to evaluate human preferences by having humans compare pairs of LLM outputs based on predefined criteria, enabling ranking across multiple LLMs by aggregating pairwise results through algorithms like Elo. However, applying these ranking algorithms in the context of LLM evaluation introduces several challenges, such as inconsistent ranking results when using ELO. Currently there is a lack of systematic study of those ranking algorithms in evaluating LLMs. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of ranking systems for head-to-head comparisons of LLMs. We formally define a set of fundamental principles for effective ranking and conduct extensive evaluations on the robustness of several ranking algorithms in the context of LLMs. Our analysis uncovers key insights into the factors that affect ranking accuracy and efficiency, offering guidelines for selecting the most appropriate methods based on specific evaluation contexts and resource constraints",

However, these tools must be implemented in advance by human developers, hindering the applicability of LLM agents in domains demanding large numbers of highly specialised tools, like in life sciences and medicine. Motivated by the growing trend of scientific studies accompanied by public code repositories, we propose ToolMaker, an agentic framework that autonomously transforms papers with code into LLM-compatible tools. Given a GitHub URL and short task description, ToolMaker autonomously installs dependencies and generates code to perform the task, using a closed-loop self-correction mechanism for debugging. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a benchmark comprising 15 complex computational tasks spanning various domains with over 100 unit tests to assess correctness and robustness. Our method correctly implements 80% of the tasks, substantially outperforming current state-of-the-art software engineering agents.

To address this gap, we introduce CrafText, a benchmark for evaluating instruction following in a multimodal environment with diverse instructions and dynamic interactions. CrafText includes 3,924 instructions with 3,423 unique words, covering Localization, Conditional, Building, and Achievement tasks.

Specifically, we construct pairs of candidate questions that differ in quality across dimensions such as topic coverage, item difficulty, item discrimination, and distractor efficiency. We then examine whether existing QG evaluation approaches can effectively distinguish these differences. Our findings reveal significant shortcomings in these approaches with respect to accurately assessing test item quality in relation to student performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel QG evaluation framework, QG-SMS, which leverages Large Language Model for Student Modeling and Simulation to perform test item analysis.

    "abstract": "Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications, and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction tasks",

This paper investigates the root causes of LLMs' poor performance in DA classification through a linguistically motivated analysis.

Our experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with these fundamental tasks, often failing to outperform simple rule-based baselines. Additionally, we establish a strong empirical correlation between errors in these pre-tasks and DA classification failures. A human study further highlights the significant gap between LLM and human-level dialogue understanding.

We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and their tendency to homogenize writing.

Current work focuses on alignment at model training time, through techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). However, it is unclear if such methods are an effective choice to teach alignment objectives to the model. First, the inability to incorporate multiple, custom rewards and reliance on a model developer's view of universal and static principles are key limitations. Second, the reliability of such approaches is also questionable (e.g. susceptibility to jailbreaking even after safety training). To address these issues, we propose DeAL, a framework that allows the user to customize reward functions and enables Decoding-time Alignment of LLMs (DeAL). At its core, we view decoding as a heuristic-guided search process and facilitate the use of a wide variety of alignment objectives. Our experiments with programmatic constraints such as keyword and length constraints, and abstract objectives such as harmlessness and helpfulness, show that we can DeAL with fine-grained trade-offs and improve adherence to alignment objectives. Lastly, we demonstrate that DeAL is largely complementary to existing alignment strategies, and can be effectively paired with RLHF and prompting techniques to achieve better alignment",

MultiMM consists of 8,461 text-image advertisement pairs, each accompanied by fine-grained annotations, providing a deeper understanding of multimodal metaphors beyond a single cultural domain. Additionally, we propose Sentiment-Enriched Metaphor Detection (SEMD), a baseline model that integrates sentiment embeddings to enhance metaphor comprehension across cultural backgrounds.

Considering the strong dependency of the candidate next tokens on different prefixes, recent studies propose to adaptively truncate the tail of LLMs' predicted distribution. Although improved results have been reported with these methods on open-ended text generation tasks, the results are highly dependent on the curated parameters and the limited exemplar text. In this paper, we propose a systematic way to estimate the intrinsic capacity of a truncation sampling method by considering the trade-off between diversity and risk at each decoding step, based on our collected prefix tree which preserves the context of a full sentence. Our work offers a comprehensive comparison of existing truncation sampling methods and serves as a practical user guideline for their parameter selection.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval. However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration. To address this limitation, we propose Radar, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary knowledge injection. Radar improves report generation by systematically leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally, by aggregating both sources, Radar generates more accurate and informative radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both language quality and clinical accuracy",

To this end, we first introduce a metric to quantify the \"entity preference\" of an LLM. We then propose ATLAS, a technique to localize bias to specific layers of the LLM by analyzing attention scores and then reduce bias by scaling attention in these biased layers. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments across 3 datasets, 4 models, and 4 baseline approaches. Our experiments demonstrate that bias is concentrated in the later layers, typically around the last third. We also show how ATLAS effectively mitigates bias through targeted interventions without compromising downstream performance and an average increase of only 0.34% in perplexity when the intervention is applied. We see an average improvement of 0.28 points in the bias score across all the datasets",

In the adversarial iterative optimization stage, the red-team model and the target model continuously improve their respective capabilities in interaction.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LMs) for individual tasks yields strong performance but is expensive for deployment and storage. Recent works explore model merging to combine multiple task-specific models into a single multi-task model without additional training. However, existing merging methods often fail for models fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation (LoRA), due to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we show that this issue arises from a previously overlooked interplay between model parameters and data distributions. We propose **O**rthogonal **S**ubspaces for **R**obust model **M**erging (**OSRM**) to constrain the LoRA subspace *prior* to fine-tuning, ensuring that updates relevant to one task do not adversely shift outputs for others. Our approach can seamlessly integrate with most existing merging algorithms, reducing the unintended interference among tasks. Extensive experiments on eight datasets, tested with three widely used LMs and two large LMs, demonstrate that our method not only boosts merging performance but also preserves single-task accuracy. Furthermore, our approach exhibits greater robustness to the hyperparameters of merging. These results highlight the importance of data-parameter interaction in model merging and offer a plug-and-play solution for merging LoRA models",

One particular exception is the BIG-Bench dataset, which has served as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the general reasoning capabilities of LLMs, thanks to its diverse set of challenging tasks that allowed for a comprehensive assessment of general reasoning across various skills within a unified framework. However, recent advances in LLMs have led to saturation on BIG-Bench, and its harder version BIG-Bench Hard (BBH). State-of-the-art models achieve near-perfect scores on many tasks in BBH, thus diminishing its utility. To address this limitation, we introduce BIG-Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), a new benchmark designed to push the boundaries of LLM reasoning evaluation. BBEH replaces each task in BBH with a novel task that probes a similar reasoning capability but exhibits significantly increased difficulty. We evaluate various general-purpose and reasoning-specialized models on BBEH and observe an accuracy of 23.9% for the best general-purpose model and 54.2% for the best reasoning-specialized model, indicating substantial room for improvement and highlighting the ongoing challenge of achieving robust general reasoning in LLMs. We release BBEH publicly at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/bbeh",

CSTree-SRI dynamically constructs the CSTree to preserve logical coherence within ELC through hierarchical synthesis and introspective validation. Then a logic-driven traversal strategy on CSTree is designed to provide efficient information retrieval for question answering.

Such inductive processes lie at the heart of scientific discovery, as they enable researchers to extract general principles from empirical observations. To assess whether LLMs possess this capacity, we introduce InductionBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the inductive reasoning ability of LLMs. Our experimental findings reveal that even the most advanced modelw available struggle to master the simplest complexity classes within the subregular hierarchy of functions, highlighting a notable deficiency in current LLMs' inductive reasoning capabilities.

In this paper, we propose a new Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) based method for domain-incremental CIT in MLLMs. During training, we learn a domain-specific SMoE module for each new domain in every FFN sub-layer of MLLMs, preventing catastrophic forgetting caused by inter-domain conflicts. Moreover, we equip the SMoE module with a domain-specific autoregressive loss (DSAL), which is used to identify the most suitable SMoE module for processing each test instruction during inference. To further enhance the SMoE module's ability to learn domain knowledge, we design an adaptive threshold-based router (AT-Router) that allocates computing resources (experts) to instruction tokens based on their importance.

This graph contains rich event information useful to reveal bias: four common types of in-doc event relations to reflect content framing bias, cross-doc event coreference relation to reveal content selection bias, and event-level moral opinions to highlight opinionated framing bias. We further develop two strategies to incorporate the multi-document event relation graph for neutralized summarization. Firstly, we convert a graph into natural language descriptions and feed the textualized graph into LLMs as a part of a hard text prompt. Secondly, we encode the graph with graph attention network and insert the graph embedding into LLMs as a soft prompt.

As the computational power of modern GPU architectures continuously improves, their memory bandwidth and capacity have not scaled proportionally, creating a critical bottleneck during inference. To address this, we investigate ternary language models (TriLMs) that employ quantization-aware training to significantly reduce memory requirements. We first analyze the scalability of TriLMs by conducting a scaling law analysis, revealing that TriLMs benefit more from increasing training data than from scaling model parameters. Based on this observation, we introduce TriTera, an open suite of TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained performance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we propose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which demonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures. Building on the 2-bit packing, we develop a GPU kernel called TriRun that accelerates end-to-end model inference by up to 5 × compared to floating-point baselines. To encourage further exploration and development of TriLMs, we will release the TriTera suite and TriRun inference kernels.

However, this process may increase the model's dependence on user input, potentially leading to the unfiltered acceptance of misinformation and the generation of hallucinations. Existing studies primarily highlight that LLMs are receptive to external information that contradict their parametric knowledge, but little research has been conducted on the direct impact of instruction-tuning on this phenomenon. In our study, we investigate the impact of instruction-tuning on LLM susceptibility to misinformation. Our analysis reveals that instruction-tuned LLMs are significantly more likely to accept misinformation when it is presented by the user. A comparison with base models shows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information, shifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore, we explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such as the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the presence of warnings in the system prompt. Our findings underscore the need for systematic approaches to mitigate unintended consequences of instruction-tuning and enhance the reliability of LLMs in real-world applications",

Despite its cultural and linguistic significance, there has been limited progress in developing a comprehensive corpus to capture these variations for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present Unggah-Ungguh, a carefully curated dataset designed to encapsulate the nuances of Unggah-Ungguh Basa, the Javanese speech etiquette framework that dictates the choice of words and phrases based on social hierarchy and context. Using Unggah-Ungguh, we assess the ability of language models (LMs) to process various levels of Javanese honorifics through classification and machine translation tasks. To further evaluate cross-lingual LMs, we conduct machine translation experiments between Javanese (at specific honorific levels) and Indonesian. Additionally, we explore whether LMs can generate contextually appropriate Javanese honorifics in conversation tasks, where the honorific usage should align with the social role and contextual cues. Our findings indicate that current LMs struggle with most honorific levels, exhibiting a bias toward certain honorific tiers",

    "abstract": "Generative Reward Models (GenRMs) leverage synthesized Chains of Thought (CoT) to reduce the need for massive labeled data, but this approach introduces risks of overoptimization due to the inability to guarantee the correctness of the CoTs. Identifying and optimizing unexpected behaviors within these synthesized CoT remains a challenge, as it heavily depends on precise annotations of intermediate behavior, similar to process supervision. In this work, we introduce a criteria-based preference tree for reward modeling, where each path in the tree represents a reasoning trajectory based on synthesized criteria. Crucially, each reasoning trajectory can be independently optimized through RL algorithm. These fine-grained process reward signals are derived from the inference-time computations and predefined rules, eliminating the need for human supervision. In experiments, SyncPL showed significant improvements over baselines on multiple human preference benchmarks. We further demonstrate that synthesized data can be learned using a long CoT format, analogous to an o1-like model, further enhancing performance while keeping stability and efficiency during training",

However, complex tables with hierarchical headers are hard to obtain high-quality textual formats (e.g., Markdown) for input under practical scenarios like webpage screenshots and scanned documents, while table images are more accessible and intuitive. Besides, existing works overlook the need of mining relations among multiple columns rather than just the semantic relation between two specific columns in real-world practice. In this work, we explore utilizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to address RE in tables with complex structures. We creatively extend the concept of RE to include calculational relations, enabling multi-task learning of both semantic and calculational RE for mutual reinforcement. Specifically, we reconstruct table images into graph structure based on neighboring nodes to extract graph-level visual features. Such feature enhancement alleviates the insensitivity of MLLMs to the positional information within table images. We then propose a Chain-of-Thought distillation framework with self-correction mechanism to enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities without increasing parameter scale. Our method significantly outperforms most baselines on wide datasets. Additionally, we release a benchmark dataset for calculational RE in complex tables",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "The few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims at enhancing the model's generalization to new relations with very few labeled instances (support instances). Most existing studies use prototype networks (ProtoNets) for FSRE and assume that the support set, adapting the model to new relations, only contains accurately labeled instances. However, this assumption is usually unrealistic, as even carefully-annotated datasets often contain mislabeled instances. Thus, it is essential to enhance the robustness of FSRE models to noisy labels in support set, but this issue remains unexplored. In this paper, we first conduct a preliminary study, revealing the high sensitivity of ProtoNets to such noisy labels. Meanwhile, we discover that fully leveraging mislabeled support instances is crucial for enhancing the model's robustness. To do this, we propose a self-denoising model for FSRE, which can automatically correct noisy labels of support instances. Specifically, our model comprises two core components: 1) a label correction module (LCM), used to correct mislabeled support instances based on the distances between them in the embedding space, and 2) a relation classification module (RCM), designed to achieve more robust relation prediction using the corrected labels generated by the LCM. Moreover, we propose a feedback-based training strategy, which focuses on training LCM and RCM to synergistically handle noisy labels in support set. Experimental results on two public datasets show the effectiveness and robustness of our model. Notably, even in scenarios without noisy labels, our model significantly outperforms all competitive baselines",

To tackle these challenges, we propose QuASAR, a question-driven self-supervised approach designed to enhance the model's structural perception and representation capabilities. Specifically, QuASAR formulates a set of structure-related queries for self-supervised training, explicitly guiding the model to capture both local and global table structures. Additionally, we introduce two auxiliary pre-training tasks: a word-to-sentence reconstruction task and a numerical summarization task, which further enhance the fluency and factuality of the generated text.

However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality, we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured clinical reporting.

Although augmenting negative image samples partially addresses these pitfalls, no prior work has employed listwise preference optimization for VLMs, due to the complexity and cost of constructing listwise image samples. In this work, we propose LPOI, the first object-aware listwise preference optimization developed for reducing hallucinations in VLMs. LPOI identifies and masks a critical object in the image, and then interpolates the masked region between the positive and negative images to form a sequence of incrementally more complete images. The model is trained to rank these images in ascending order of object visibility, effectively reducing hallucinations while retaining visual fidelity. LPOI requires no extra annotations beyond standard pairwise preference data, as it automatically constructs the ranked lists through object masking and interpolation. Comprehensive experiments on MMHalBench, AMBER, and Object HalBench confirm that LPOI outperforms existing preference optimization methods in reducing hallucinations and enhancing VLM performance",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "This paper argues that generating output tokens is more effective than using pooled representations for prediction tasks because token-level generation retains more mutual information. Since LLMs are trained on massive text corpora using next-token prediction, generation aligns naturally with their learned behavior. Using the Data Processing Inequality (DPI), we provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting this claim. However, autoregressive models face two key challenges when used for prediction: (1) exposure bias, where the model sees ground-truth tokens during training but relies on its own predictions during inference, leading to errors, and (2) format mismatch, where discrete tokens do not always align with the task's required output structure. To address these challenges, we introduce PredGen (Predicting Through Generating), an end-to-end framework that (i) uses scheduled sampling to reduce exposure bias, and (ii) introduces a task adapter to convert the generated tokens into structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce Writer-Director Alignment Loss (WDAL), which ensures consistency between token generation and final task predictions, improving both text coherence and numerical accuracy. We evaluate PredGen on multiple classification and regression benchmarks. Our results show that PredGen consistently outperforms standard baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in structured prediction tasks",

    "abstract": "Despite the popularity of large language model (LLM) quantization for inference acceleration, significant uncertainty remains regarding the accuracy-performance trade-offs associated with various quantization formats. We present a comprehensive empirical study of quantized accuracy, evaluating popular quantization formats (FP8, INT8, INT4) across academic benchmarks and real-world tasks, on the entire Llama-3.1 model family. Additionally, our study examines the difference in text generated by quantized models versus their uncompressed counterparts. Beyond benchmarks, we also present a couple of quantization improvements which allowed us to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy recovery results. Our investigation, encompassing over 500,000 individual evaluations, yields several key findings: (1) FP8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-FP) is lossless across all model scales, (2) INT8 weight and activation quantization (W8A8-INT), when properly tuned, incurs surprisingly low 1-3% accuracy degradation, and (3) INT4 weight-only quantization (W4A16-INT) is competitive with 8-bit integer weight and activation quantization. To address the question of the \"best\" format for a given deployment environment, we conduct inference performance analysis using the popular open-source vLLM framework on various GPU architectures. We find that W4A16 offers the best cost-efficiency for synchronous deployments, and for asynchronous deployment on mid-tier GPUs. At the same time, W8A8 formats excel in asynchronous deployment of mid and large-size models on high-end GPUs.

No previous work has done a systematic, empirical comparison of both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated data augmentation strategies, leaving uncertainty about whether the additional time and effort of linguistically-motivated data augmentation work in fact yields better downstream performance.In this work, we conduct a careful and comprehensive comparison of augmentation strategies (both linguistically-naive and linguistically-motivated) for two low-resource languages with different morphological properties, Uspanteko and Arapaho. We evaluate the effectiveness of many different strategies and their combinations across two important sequence-to-sequence tasks for low-resource languages: machine translation and interlinear glossing.

We observe that many widely-used preference models—including human evaluators, GPT-4, and top-ranking models on the RewardBench benchmark—exhibit strong biases towards specific format patterns, such as lists, links, bold text, and emojis. Furthermore, large language models (LLMs) can exploit these biases to achieve higher rankings on popular benchmarks like AlpacaEval and LMSYS Chatbot Arena. One notable example is verbosity bias, where current preference models favor longer responses that appear more comprehensive, even when their quality is equal to or lower than shorter responses. However, format biases beyond verbosity remain largely underexplored. In this work, we extend the study of biases in preference learning beyond the commonly recognized length bias, offering a comprehensive analysis of a wider range of format biases. Additionally, we show that with a small amount of biased data (less than 1%), we can inject significant bias into the reward model. Moreover, these format biases can also be easily exploited by downstream alignment algorithms, such as *best-of-n sampling* and online iterative *DPO*, as it is usually easier to manipulate the format than to improve the quality of responses.

Second, inspired by the \"Society of Mind\" theory, we propose a novel multi-agent framework where large language models (LLMs) act as expert agents for each linguistic aspect.

This paper focuses on formal verification, an immediate application scenario of formal reasoning, and breaks it down into sub-tasks. We constructed 18k high-quality instruction-response pairs across five mainstream formal specification languages (Coq, Lean4, Dafny, ACSL, and TLA+) in six tasks by distilling gpt-4o and evaluated against ten open-sourced LLMs, including recent popular DeepSeek-R1. We found that LLMs are good at writing proof segments when given either the code, or the detailed description of proof steps. Also, the fine-tuning brought about a nearly threefold improvement at most. And interestingly, we observed that fine-tuning with formal data also enhances abilities in mathematics, reasoning, and coding. We hope our findings inspire further research",

It dynamically determines whether LLMs need external knowledge for generation and invokes retrieval accordingly. This paper introduces Self-aware Knowledge Retrieval (SeaKR), a novel adaptive RAG model that extracts self-aware uncertainty of LLMs from their internal states. SeaKR activates retrieval when the LLMs present high self-aware uncertainty for generation. To effectively integrate retrieved knowledge snippets, SeaKR re-ranks them based on LLM's self-aware uncertainty to preserve the snippet that reduces their uncertainty to the utmost. To facilitate solving complex tasks that require multiple retrievals, SeaKR utilizes their self-aware uncertainty to choose among different reasoning strategies.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted the field of Math Word Problems (MWPs), transforming how these problems are approached and solved, particularly in educational contexts. However, existing evaluations often focus on final accuracy, neglecting the critical aspect of reasoning capabilities. This work addresses that gap by evaluating LLMs' abilities to detect and correct reasoning mistakes. We present a novel dataset, MWP-MISTAKE, containing MWPs with both correct and incorrect reasoning steps generated through rule-based methods and smaller language models. Our comprehensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o and GPT4 uncovers important insights into their strengths and limitations. While GPT-4o excels in mistake detection and rectification, gaps remain, particularly in handling complex datasets and novel problems. Additionally, we identify concerns with data contamination and memorization, which affect LLM reliability in real-world applications. While OpenAI' O1 model demonstrates 90% accuracy in reasoning and final answers on complex tasks, it remains weak in mistake detection. Our findings highlight the need for improved reasoning evaluations and suggest ways to enhance LLM generalization and robustness in math problem-solving",

However, recent works show that LLMs' intrinsic self-correction fails without oracle labels as feedback.

We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1) cause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias on simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex tasks.

However, our preliminary experiments show that fewer than 35% of samples generated by Qwen-2-72B are multi-hop, and over 40% exhibit poor quality, limiting comprehensive understanding and further research. To address this, we propose the Multi-agent Interactive Multi-hop Generation (MIMG) framework, which integrates a quality verification agent, a single-hop question generation agent, a multiple question sampling strategy, and a multi-hop question merger agent. This framework significantly improves data quality, with high-quality, multi-hop, and diverse data.

Despite these advancements, LLM-based recommender systems face inherent limitations stemming from their LLM backbones, particularly issues of hallucinations and the lack of up-to-date and domain-specific knowledge.Recently, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has garnered significant attention for addressing these limitations by leveraging external knowledge sources to enhance the understanding and generation of LLMs. However, vanilla RAG methods often introduce noise and neglect structural relationships in knowledge, limiting their effectiveness in LLM-based recommendations. To address these limitations, we propose to retrieve high-quality and up-to-date structure information from the knowledge graph (KG) to augment recommendations.

The one-size-fits-all alignment mechanism undermines LLM's utility for these qualified users.

However, recent works extending CLIP suffer from the issue of *modality gap*, which arises when the image and text embeddings are projected to disparate manifolds, deviating from the intended objective of image-text contrastive learning. We discover that this phenomenon is linked to the modality-specific characteristic that each image or text encoder independently possesses. Herein, we propose two methods to address the modality gap: (1) a post-hoc embedding standardization method, I0Tpost that reduces the modality gap approximately to zero and (2) a trainable method, I0Tasync, to alleviate the modality gap problem by adding two normalization layers for each encoder. Our I0T framework can significantly reduce the modality gap while preserving the original embedding representations of trained models with their locked parameters. In practice, I0Tpost can serve as an alternative explainable automatic evaluation metric of widely used CLIPScore (CLIP-S). The code is available in https://github.com/xfactlab/I0T",

A key challenge in current research is how to achieve controllable multi-objective generation while enabling rapid adaptation to accommodate diverse user demands during test time. Existing solutions, such as Rewarded Soup, focus on merging language models individually tuned on single objectives. While easy to implement and widely used, these approaches face limitations in achieving optimal performance due to their disregard for the impacts of competing objectives on model tuning. To address this issue, we propose **Bone Soup**, a novel model merging approach that first seeks a series of back**bone** models by considering the impacts of multiple objectives and then makes the **soup** (i.e., merge the backbone models). Specifically, Bone Soup begins by training multiple backbone models for different objectives using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Each backbone model is guided by a combination of backbone reward signals. To ensure that these models are optimal for the Pareto front, the backbone rewards are crafted by combining standard reward functions into basis vectors, which can then be modified through a rule-based construction method. Bone Soup leverages a symmetric circulant matrix mapping to generate the merging coefficients, which are used to merge the backbone models according to user preferences.Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Bone Soup exhibits strong controllability and Pareto optimality in controllable multi-objective generation, providing a more effective and efficient approach to addressing diverse user needs at test time",

This is achieved through an algorithmic runtime system that implements the developer-supplied policy, limiting LLMs to (1) parse user input using a succinct conversational history, and (2) generate responses according to supplied content. Agents built with Genie outperform SOTA methods on complex logic dialogue datasets by up to 20.5%. We conducted a user study with 62 participants.

Inspired by human continual learning, Recurrent-KIF employs an inner loop that rapidly adapts to new tasks while identifying important parameters, coupled with an outer loop that globally manages the fusion of new and historical knowledge through redundant knowledge pruning and key knowledge merging. These inner-outer loops iteratively perform multiple rounds of fusion, allowing Recurrent-KIF to leverage intermediate training information and adaptively adjust fusion strategies based on evolving importance distributions. Extensive experiments on two CL benchmarks with various model sizes (from 770M to 13B) demonstrate that Recurrent-KIF effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and enhances knowledge transfer",

    "abstract": "Many sensitive domains — such as the clinical domain — lack widely available datasets due to privacy risks. The increasing generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have made synthetic datasets a viable path forward. In this study, we domain-adapt LLMs to the clinical domain and generate synthetic clinical texts that are machine-annotated with tags for personally identifiable information using capable encoder-based NER models. The synthetic corpora are then used to train synthetic NER models. The results show that training NER models using synthetic corpora incurs only a small drop in predictive performance. The limits of this process are investigated in a systematic ablation study — using both Swedish and Spanish data. Our analysis shows that smaller datasets can be sufficient for domain-adapting LLMs for data synthesis. Instead, the effectiveness of this process is almost entirely contingent on the performance of the machine-annotating NER models trained using the original data",

    "title": "Just a Scratch: Enhancing LLM Capabilities for Self-harm Detection through Intent Differentiation and Emoji Interpretation",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Self-harm detection on social media is critical for early intervention and mental health support, yet remains challenging due to the subtle, context-dependent nature of such expressions. Identifying self-harm intent aids suicide prevention by enabling timely responses, but current large language models (LLMs) struggle to interpret implicit cues in casual language and emojis. This work enhances LLMs' comprehension of self-harm by distinguishing intent through nuanced language–emoji interplay. We present the Centennial Emoji Sensitivity Matrix (CESM-100)—a curated set of 100 emojis with contextual self-harm interpretations—and the Self-Harm Identification aNd intent Extraction with Supportive emoji sensitivity (SHINES) dataset, offering detailed annotations for self-harm labels, casual mentions (CMs), and serious intents (SIs). Our unified framework:a) enriches inputs using CESM-100;b) fine-tunes LLMs for multi-task learning—self-harm detection (primary) and CM/SI span detection (auxiliary);c) generate explainable rationales for self-harm predictions. We evaluate the framework on three state-of-the-art LLMs—Llama 3, Mental-Alpaca, and MentalLlama—across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned scenarios. By coupling intent differentiation with contextual cues, our approach commendably enhances LLM performance in both detection and explanation tasks, effectively addressing the inherent ambiguity in self-harm signals.

We investigate automatic treebank generation by large language models (LLMs) in this paper. The performance of LLMs on constituency parsing is poor, therefore we propose a novel treebank generation method, LLM back generation, which is similar to the reverse process of constituency parsing. LLM back generation takes the incomplete cross-domain constituency tree with only domain keyword leaf nodes as input and fills the missing words to generate the cross-domain constituency treebank. Besides, we also introduce a span-level contrastive learning pre-training strategy to make full use of the LLM back generation treebank for cross-domain constituency parsing. We verify the effectiveness of our LLM back generation treebank coupled with contrastive learning pre-training on five target domains of MCTB.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Vanilla spiking neurons are simplified from complex biological neurons with dendrites, soma, and synapses, into single somatic compartments. Due to limitations in performance and training efficiency, vanilla spiking neurons face significant challenges in modeling long sequences. In terms of performance, the oversimplified dynamics of spiking neurons omit long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, the long-tail membrane potential distribution and binary activation discretization errors further limit their capacity to model long sequences. In terms of efficiency, the serial mechanism of spiking neurons leads to excessively long training times for long sequences. Though parallel spiking neurons are an efficient solution, their number of parameters is often tied to the hidden dimension or sequence length, which makes current parallel neurons unsuitable for large architectures. To address these issues, we propose **MMDEND**: a Multi-Branch Multi-Compartment Parallel Spiking Dendritic Neuron. Its proportion-adjustable multi-branch, multi-compartment structure enables long-term temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a Scaling-Shifting Integer Firing (SSF) mechanism that fits the long-tail membrane potential distribution, retains efficiency, and mitigates discretization errors. Compared with parallel neurons, MMDEND achieves better long-sequence modeling capability with fewer parameters and lower energy consumption. Visualization also confirms that the SSF mechanism effectively fits long-tail distributions",

    "title": "Understanding Impact of Human Feedback via Influence Functions",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. Our experiments showcase two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common labeler biases in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers in refining their strategies to better align with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs), debating tasks, such as argument quality assessment and debate process simulation, have made significant progress. However, existing LLM-based debating systems focus on responding to specific arguments while neglecting objective assessments such as authenticity and logical validity. Furthermore, these systems lack a structured approach to optimize across various dimensions—including evaluation metrics, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and multi-turn debate refinement—thereby limiting their effectiveness. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose a dual-component framework: (1) InspireScore, a novel evaluation system that establishes a multi-dimensional assessment architecture incorporating four subjective criteria (emotional appeal, argument clarity, argument arrangement, and topic relevance) alongside two objective metrics (fact authenticity and logical validity); and (2) InspireDebate, an optimized debating framework employing a phased optimization approach through CoT reasoning enhancement, multi-dimensional Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and real-time knowledge grounding via web-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (Web-RAG). Empirical evaluations demonstrate that InspireScore achieves 44% higher correlation with expert judgments compared to existing methods, while InspireDebate shows significant improvements, outperforming baseline models by 57%.

Recent efforts have also tried to equip the agent with the ability to explore environments and continuously improve over time. However, existing works only focused on building text-only agents in synthetic environments where the reward signals are clearly defined. Such agents can hardly generalize to realistic settings that require multimodal perception ability and provide no ground-truth signal. In this paper, we introduce an innovative multimodal web agent that can autonomously conduct real-world exploration and improve itself. We first train the base model with imitation learning to gain the basic abilities. We then let the agent explore the open web and collect feedback on its trajectories. After that, it further improves its policy by learning from well-performing trajectories judged by another general-purpose model. This exploration-feedback-optimization cycle can continue for several iterations. Experimental results show that our web agent successfully improves itself after each iteration, demonstrating strong performance across multiple test sets.

    "abstract": "Counterspeech has proven to be a powerful tool to combat hate speech online. Previous studies have focused on generating counterspeech conditioned only on specific intents (single attributed). However, a holistic approach considering multiple attributes simultaneously can yield more nuanced and effective responses. Here, we introduce HiPPrO, Hierarchical Prefix learning with Preference Optimization, a novel two-stage framework that utilizes the effectiveness of attribute-specific prefix embedding spaces hierarchically optimized during the counterspeech generation process in the first phase. Thereafter, we incorporate both reference and reward-free preference optimization to generate more constructive counterspeech. Furthermore, we extend IntentCONANv2 by annotating all 13,973 counterspeech instances with emotion labels by five annotators. HiPPrO leverages hierarchical prefix optimization to integrate these dual attributes effectively. An extensive evaluation demonstrates that HiPPrO achieves a 38 % improvement in intent conformity and a 3 %, 2 %, 3 % improvement in Rouge-1, Rouge-2, and Rouge-L, respectively, compared to several baseline models. Human evaluations further substantiate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the enhanced relevance and appropriateness of the generated counterspeech.

While existing embedding models excel at capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically extracts fine-grained political topics and corresponding bias indicators from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding, which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and predictive power. Through extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, we demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in political bias classification while offering highly interpretable representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable. To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge of epistemic modality in LLMs",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in enhancing the factuality of LLMs' generation, making them a focal point of research. However, previous RAG approaches overlook the lexical diversity of queries, hindering their ability to achieve a granular relevance assessment between queries and retrieved documents, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a Lexical Diversity-aware RAG (DRAG) method to address the biases in relevant information retrieval and utilization induced by lexical diversity. Specifically, a Diversity-sensitive Relevance Analyzer is proposed to decouple and assess the relevance of different query components (words, phrases) based on their levels of lexical diversity, ensuring precise and comprehensive document retrieval. Moreover, a Risk-guided Sparse Calibration strategy is further introduced to calibrate the generated tokens that is heavily affected by irrelevant content. Through these modules, DRAG is capable of effectively retrieving relevant documents and leverages their pertinent knowledge to refine the original results and generate meaningful outcomes. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding a 10.6% accuracy improvement on HotpotQA",

To facilitate this paradigm, we propose Focus-Centric Data Synthesis, a scalable bottom-up approach for synthesizing high-quality data with elaborate reasoning paths. Through this approach, We construct VISC-150K, a large-scale dataset with reasoning data in the form of Focus-Centric Visual Chain, specifically designed for multi-image tasks. Experimental results on seven multi-image benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves average performance gains of 3.16% and 2.24% across two distinct model architectures, without compromising the general vision-language capabilities.

Existing RRG models mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based on different model architectures using data pairs of radiological images and corresponding radiologist-annotated reports. Recent research has shifted focus to post-training improvements, aligning RRG model outputs with human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL). However, the limited data coverage of high-quality annotated data poses risks of overfitting and generalization. This paper proposes a novel Online Iterative Self-Alignment (OISA) method for RRG that consists of four stages: self-generation of diverse data, self-evaluation for multi-objective preference data, self-alignment for multi-objective optimization and self-iteration for further improvement. Our approach allows for generating varied reports tailored to specific clinical objectives, enhancing the overall performance of the RRG model iteratively. Unlike existing methods, our framework significantly increases data quality and optimizes performance through iterative multi-objective optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "Keyboard-based interaction may not accommodate various needs, especially for individuals with disabilities. While inertial sensor-based writing recognition is promising due to the sensors' small size, wearability, and low cost, accurate recognition in the Chinese context is hampered by the difficulty of collecting extensive inertial signal samples for the vast number of characters. Therefore, we design a Chinese Inertial GAN (CI-GAN) containing Chinese glyph encoding (CGE), forced optimal transport (FOT), and semantic relevance alignment (SRA) to acquire unlimited high-quality training samples. Unlike existing vectorization methods focusing on the meaning of Chinese characters, CGE represents shape and stroke features, providing glyph guidance for writing signal generation. FOT establishes a triple-consistency constraint between the input prompt, output signal features, and real signal features, ensuring the authenticity and semantic accuracy of the generated signals. SRA aligns semantic relationships between multiple outputs and their input prompts, ensuring that similar inputs correspond to similar outputs (and vice versa), alleviating model hallucination. The three modules guide the generator while also interacting with each other, forming a coupled system. By utilizing the massive training samples provided by CI-GAN, the performance of six widely used classifiers is improved from 6.7% to 98.4%, indicating that CI-GAN constructs a flexible and efficient data platform for Chinese inertial writing recognition. Furthermore, we release the first Chinese inertial writing dataset on GitHub",

While prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs, their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation, designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms.

Many existing approaches aim to mimic human thought processes by enabling large models to perform retrieval-augmented generation step by step. However, these methods can only perform single chain reasoning, which lacks the ability for multi-path exploration, strategic look-ahead, stepwise evaluation, and global selection. In addition, to effectively decompose complex problems, these methods can only rely on labor-intensive intermediate annotations for supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose GRAT, an algorithm guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and process rewards. GRAT not only enables self-evaluation and self-correction but also assigns fine-grained rewards to each intermediate step in the search path. These fine-grained annotations can be used for model self-training, which enables GRAT to continuously self-update its problem analysis and reasoning capabilities. We conducted experiments on four multihop QA datasets: HotPotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle, demonstrating that GRAT outperforms various RAG-based methods.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been pivotal in enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow instructions and produce meaningful alignment by leveraging human preference data. Traditionally, RLHF involves generating responses to a query and using a separate reward model to assign a score to the entire completion. This approach, however, presents challenges, as it provides a single, sparse reward at the end of a sequence, making optimization difficult for the model, in which both training and generation occur auto-regressively at token levels. While recent methods have attempted to address this by assigning token-level discrete or continuous rewards, these often rely on either a trained credit assignment model or AI annotators, which raises concerns about the quality and reliability of the token-level rewards. In this paper, we propose T-REG, which utilizes both sequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. T-REG employs self-generated token-level rewards, derived through opposite prompting, as a weak supervision signal to guide the model in distributing sequence-level rewards at the token level, thereby achieving more effective token-level credit assignment and improving alignment performance.

However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs × 8 prompting strategies × 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought.We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications.Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

In experiments on both perturbed natural language corpora and languages defined by probabilistic finite-state automata (PFSA), we show that languages with higher m-local entropy are more difficult for Transformer and LSTM LMs to learn.

Existing robust benchmark datasets have two key limitations: 1) They generate only a limited range of perturbations for a single Information Extraction (IE) task, which fails to evaluate the robustness of UIE models effectively; 2) They rely on small models or handcrafted rules to generate perturbations, often resulting in unnatural adversarial examples. Considering the powerful generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce a new benchmark dataset for Robust UIE, called RUIE-Bench, which utilizes LLMs to generate more diverse and realistic perturbations across different IE tasks. Based on this dataset, we comprehensively evaluate existing UIE models and reveal that both LLM-based models and other models suffer from significant performance drops. To improve robustness and reduce training costs, we propose a data-augmentation solution that dynamically selects hard samples for iterative training based on the model's inference loss. Experimental results show that training with only 15% of the data leads to an average 8.1% relative performance improvement across three IE tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarisation, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, such as social media threads. We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation",

Building on Loewenstein's Information Gap Theory, we introduce a framework that models reader curiosity by quantifying semantic information gaps within a text's semantic structure. Our approach leverages BERTopic-inspired topic modeling and persistent homology to analyze the evolving topology (connected components, cycles, voids) of a dynamic semantic network derived from text segments, treating these features as proxies for information gaps. To empirically evaluate this pipeline, we collect reader curiosity ratings from participants (*n* = 49) as they read S. Collins's \"The Hunger Games\" novel. We then use the topological features from our pipeline as independent variables to predict these ratings, and experimentally show that they significantly improve curiosity prediction compared to a baseline model (73% vs. 30% explained deviance), validating our approach. This pipeline offers a new computational method for analyzing text structure and its relation to reader engagement",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models, specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models undergo loss deceleration early in training—an abrupt slowdown in the rate of loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL, per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to improve language models independent of scale.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have encoded vast amounts of knowledge in their parameters, but the acquired knowledge can sometimes be incorrect or outdated over time, necessitating rectification after pre-training. Traditional localized methods in knowledge-based model editing (KME) typically assume that knowledge is stored in particular intermediate layers. However, recent research suggests that these methods do not identify the optimal locations for parameter editing, as knowledge gradually accumulates across all layers in LLMs during the forward pass rather than being stored in specific layers. This paper, for the first time, introduces the concept of critical transmission paths into KME for parameter updating. Specifically, these paths capture the key information flows that significantly influence the model predictions for the editing process. To facilitate this process, we also design a parameter-aware contrastive rectifying algorithm that considers less important paths as contrastive examples. Experiments on two prominent datasets and three widely used LLMs demonstrate the superiority of our method in editing performance",

Although recent AI methods, particularly large language models (LLMs), have shown promise in tasks such as hypothesis generation and experimental design, they fall short of replicating the collaborative nature of real-world scientific practices, where diverse experts work together in teams to tackle complex problems.

ITT enables deeper processing of critical tokens without parameter expansion. Evaluations across 162M-466M parameter models show ITT achieves 96.5% performance of a 466M Transformer using only 162M parameters, reduces training data by 43.2%, and outperforms Transformer/Loop variants in 11 benchmarks.

MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited, as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function.

While prior work has focused on forgetting small, random subsets of training data at the instance-level, we argue that real-world scenarios often require the removal of an entire user data, which may require a more careful maneuver. In this study, we explore entity-level unlearning, which aims to erase all knowledge related to a target entity while preserving the remaining model capabilities. To address this, we introduce Opt-Out, an optimal transport-based unlearning method that utilizes the Wasserstein distance from the model's initial parameters to achieve more effective and fine-grained unlearning. We also present the first Entity-Level Unlearning Dataset (ELUDe) designed to evaluate entity-level unlearning.

This paper proposes a novel dynamic mixture approach that effectively combines the probability distributions of small models and LLMs during the beam search decoding phase, achieving a balanced enhancement of precise corrections from small models and the fluency of LLMs. This approach also eliminates the need for fine-tuning LLMs, saving significant time and resources, and facilitating domain adaptation.

In this paper, we propose a light-weight plug-and-play DISC (i.e., decoding intervention with similarity of characters) module for CSC models. DISC measures phonetic and glyph similarities between characters and incorporates this similarity information only during the inference phase.

    "title": "Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser—which maps character-strings to subwords—should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as **tokenisation bias**. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., ⟨ hello ⟩) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \"hello\"). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first K to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where K is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling",

Furthermore, we introduce an innovative approach for constructing an iterative self-calibration training set, which optimizes LLMs to efficiently harness uncertainty scores for capturing critical information and enhancing response accuracy.

To address these issues, we propose an SFT-based LLM rumor detection model with Influence guided Sample selection and Game-based multi-perspective Analysis (ISGA). Specifically, we first introduce the Influence Score (IS) to assess the impact of samples on model predictions and select samples for SFT. We also approximate IS via Taylor expansion to reduce computational complexity. Next, we use LLMs to generate in-depth analyses of news content from multiple perspectives and model their collaborative process for prediction as a cooperative game. Then we utilize the Shapley value to quantify the contribution of each perspective for selecting informative perspective analyses. Experiments show that ISGA excels existing SOTA on three datasets",

Based on this observation, we proposed a novel KV cache reduction method, SpindleKV, which balances both shallow and deep layers.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and BCQ's non-uniform quantization levels. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entities between two different multi-modal knowledge graphs. Current methods have made significant progress by improving embedding and cross-modal fusion. However, most of them depend on using loss functions to capture the relationship between modalities or adopt a one-time strategy to directly compute modality weights using attention mechanisms, which overlooks the relative interactions between modalities at the entity level and the accuracy of modality weights, thereby hindering the generalization to diverse entities. To address this challenge, we propose RICEA, a relative interaction and calibration framework for multi-modal entity alignment, which dynamically computes weights based on the relative interaction and recalibrates the weights according to their uncertainties. Among these, we propose a novel method called ADC that utilizes attention mechanisms to perceive the uncertainty of the weight for each modality, rather than directly calculating the weight of each modality as in previous works. Across 5 datasets and 23 settings, our proposed framework significantly outperforms other baselines. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ChenxiaoLi-Joe/RICEA",

By integrating into the model's information flow, MoNIM functions as an FFN-like bypass layer within the Transformer architecture, enabling effective learning of new knowledge.

The dataset includes 14 clinically significant AEs—such as falls, delirium, and intracranial haemorrhage, along with contextual attributes like negation, diagnosis type, and in-hospital occurrence. Uniquely, the annotation schema supports both discontinuous and overlapping entities, addressing challenges rarely tackled in prior work. We evaluate multiple models using FlairNLP across three annotation granularities: fine-grained, coarse-grained, and coarse-grained with negation. While transformer-based models (e.g., BERT-cased) achieve strong performance on document-level coarse-grained extraction (F1 = 0.943), performance drops notably for fine-grained entity-level tasks (e.g., F1 = 0.675), particularly for rare events and complex attributes. These results demonstrate that despite high-level scores, significant challenges remain in detecting underrepresented AEs and capturing nuanced clinical language. Developed within a Trusted Research Environment (TRE), the dataset is available upon request via DataLoch and serves as a robust benchmark for evaluating AE extraction methods and supporting future cross-dataset generalisation",

Current works typically fine-tune LLMs using slow-fast code pairs mined from online programming platforms. Although these methods are widely recognized for their effectiveness, the training data often lack clear code acceleration patterns and offer only limited speed improvements. Moreover, existing training methods, such as direct instruction fine-tuning (IFT), tend to overlook the hierarchical relationships among acceleration patterns. In this work, we introduce BITE, a novel training paradigm designed to improve LLMs' CA capabilities through two key innovations: (1) Bidirectional tree editing, which generates high-quality training data by incrementally transforming given code into both its most efficient and least efficient variants, and (2) Progressive code acceleration learning, which enables LLMs to internalize multi-level CA strategies by learning increasingly sophisticated acceleration patterns. Additionally, we introduce a new CA evaluation benchmark and metric for comprehensive assessment of model performance on CA tasks. Extensive experiments on both our benchmark and existing benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings",

In this paper, we propose PIPER, the first comprehensive benchmark for Probing Into the Performance boundary of LLMs in Event Reasoning. Motivated by our evaluation observations and error patterns analysis, we meticulously craft 10K diverse instruction-tuning demonstrations to alleviate event reasoning-oriented data scarcity. Additionally, a novel Debiasing and Distillation-Enhanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (D2E-SFT) strategy is presented, which facilitates adhering to context and fixating significant contextual event information to elevate the event reasoning capability. Specifically, D2E-SFT removes the given sample's context to construct an imagined sample, subtracting its logits to mitigate the bias of neglecting context and improve contextual faithfulness. To guide the model in emphasizing significant contextual event information, D2E-SFT employs a context-refined sample to achieve self-distillation with the alignment of logits.

We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an \"intuitive prior'' into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of Transformer-based text embedding models in NLP tasks, surprising \"sticky tokens\" can undermine the reliability of embeddings. These tokens, when repeatedly inserted into sentences, pull sentence similarity toward a certain value, disrupting the normal distribution of embedding distances and degrading downstream performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate such anomalous tokens, formally defining them and introducing an efficient detection method, Sticky Token Detector (STD), based on sentence and token filtering. Applying STD to 40 checkpoints across 14 model families, we discover a total of 868 sticky tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens often originate from special or unused entries in the vocabulary, as well as fragmented subwords from multilingual corpora. Notably, their presence does not strictly correlate with model size or vocabulary size. We further evaluate how sticky tokens affect downstream tasks like clustering and retrieval, observing significant performance drops of up to 50%. Through attention-layer analysis, we show that sticky tokens disproportionately dominate the model's internal representations, raising concerns about tokenization robustness. Our findings show the need for better tokenization strategies and model design to mitigate the impact of sticky tokens in future text embedding applications",

This paper proposes a four-tier knowledge injection framework that systematically defines the levels of knowledge injection: memorization, retrieval, reasoning, and association. Based on this framework, we introduce DeepKnowledge, a synthetic experimental testbed designed for fine-grained evaluation of the depth of knowledge injection across three knowledge types (novel, incremental, and updated). We then explore various knowledge injection scenarios and evaluate the depth of knowledge injection for each scenario on the benchmark. Experimental results reveal key factors to reach each level of knowledge injection for LLMs and establish a mapping between the levels of knowledge injection and the corresponding suitable injection methods, aiming to provide a comprehensive approach for efficient knowledge injection across various levels.

    "abstract": "In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch—a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20× gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training",

Our extensive experiments investigate pretraining, model configurations, compression rates, efficiency across tasks, and adaptability to various LLMs. Results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in three domains and across eight datasets while being adaptable to different downstream LLMs. We find that thorough pretraining and carefully selected compression rates, such as 4x and 16x, enable a lightweight compressor to achieve a good balance between accuracy and speed.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Text embeddings from PLM-based models enable a wide range of applications, yet their performance often degrades on longer texts. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenon we call Length Collapse, where embeddings of longer texts tend to cluster together. This clustering results in a distributional inconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further investigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline observed with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass filter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the strength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more low-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more similar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for longer texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale, which mitigates the Length Collapse phenomenon. By narrowing the gap in low-pass filtering rates between long and short texts, TempScale ensures more consistent embeddings across different text lengths. This approach leads to performance improvements of 0.94% on MTEB and 1.10% on LongEmbed, which focuses specifically on long-context retrieval, providing strong evidence for the validity of our analysis.

SHuBERT adapts masked token prediction objectives to multi-stream visual sign language input, learning to predict multiple targets corresponding to clustered hand, face, and body pose streams. SHuBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks including sign language translation, isolated sign language recognition, and fingerspelling detection",

    "title": "ERU-KG: Efficient Reference-aligned Unsupervised Keyphrase Generation",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems, we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised baselines and achieving on average 89% of the performance of a supervised model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility, we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements",

    "title": "Know Your Mistakes: Towards Preventing Overreliance on Task-Oriented Conversational AI Through Accountability Modeling",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Recent LLMs have enabled significant advancements for conversational agents. However, they are also well known to hallucinate, producing responses that seem plausible but are factually incorrect. On the other hand, users tend to over-rely on LLM-based AI agents, accepting AI's suggestion even when it is wrong. Adding positive friction, such as explanations or getting user confirmations, has been proposed as a mitigation in AI-supported decision-making systems. In this paper, we propose an accountability model for LLM-based task-oriented dialogue agents to address user overreliance via friction turns in cases of model uncertainty and errors associated with dialogue state tracking (DST). The accountability model is an augmented LLM with an additional accountability head that functions as a binary classifier to predict the relevant slots of the dialogue state mentioned in the conversation. We perform our experiments with multiple backbone LLMs on two established benchmarks (MultiWOZ and Snips). Our empirical findings demonstrate that the proposed approach not only enables reliable estimation of AI agent errors but also guides the decoder in generating more accurate actions. We observe around 3% absolute improvement in joint goal accuracy (JGA) of DST output by incorporating accountability heads into modern LLMs. Self-correcting the detected errors further increases the JGA from 67.13 to 70.51, achieving state-of-the-art DST performance. Finally, we show that error correction through user confirmations (friction turn) achieves a similar performance gain, highlighting its potential to reduce user overreliance",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proven to be an effective approach to address the hallucination problem in large language models (LLMs). In current RAG systems, LLMs typically need to synthesize knowledge provided by two main external sources (user prompts and an external database) to generate a final answer. When the knowledge provided by the user conflicts with that retrieved from the database, a critical question arises: Does the LLM favor one knowledge source over the other when generating the answer? In this paper, we are the first to unveil a new phenomenon, Authority Bias, where the LLMs tend to favor the knowledge provided by the user even when it deviates from the facts; this new phenomenon is rigorously evidenced via our novel and comprehensive characterization of Authority Bias in six widely used LLMs and across diverse task scenarios. We propose a novel dataset specifically designed for detecting Authority Bias, called the Authority Bias Detection Dataset (ABDD), and introduce new, detailed metrics to measure Authority Bias. To mitigate Authority bias, we finally propose the Conflict Detection Enhanced Query (CDEQ) framework. We identify the sentences and atomic information that generate conflicts, perform a credibility assessment on the conflicting paragraphs, and ultimately enhance the query to detect perturbed text, thereby reducing Authority bias. Comparative experiments with widely used mitigation methods demonstrate that CDEQ exhibits both effectiveness and advancement, significantly enhancing the robustness of RAG systems",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, their ability to autonomously execute complex real-world tasks remains limited. Accordingly, tool learning has emerged to enable LLMs to effectively leverage external tools to extend their capabilities. Current tool-learning paradigms like CoT/ReAct employ sequential tool invocation but suffer from constrained perception and inadequate task planning. Alternative approaches using search-based decision trees incur substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose DTA-Llama (Divide-Then-Aggregate Llama), a novel parallel tool invocation framework featuring: (1) A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure that transformed from traditional tree-based tool search paths, enabling parallel execution and contributing high-quality training data; (2) A process-thread-inspired inference mechanism that iteratively decomposes tasks into parallel tool-using subtasks while aggregating results for subsequent decisions. Experimental results show that our approach substantially enhances task performance while reducing token consumption and inference time. Llama2-7B, using our method, is comparable to the official parallel function calling method of GPT-3.5. The relevant code, dataset, and model weights are available at https://corn0205.github.io/",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians' restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our system improves OCR accuracy from 46.83% to 84.05%, with further enhancement to 94.25% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation.

To address these issues, we investigate how to construct more comprehensive and diversified contrasting patterns to enhance preference data (RQ1) and verify the impact of the diversification of contrasting patterns on model alignment (RQ2). For RQ1, we propose PopAlign, a framework that integrates diversified contrasting patterns across the prompt, model, and pipeline levels, introducing six contrasting strategies that do not require additional feedback labeling procedures.

Existing techniques face the emerging challenges of the re-identification ability of large language models (LLMs), which have shown advanced capability in memorizing detailed information and reasoning over dispersed pieces of patterns to draw conclusions. When defending against LLM-based re-identification, anonymization could jeopardize the utility of the resulting anonymized data in downstream tasks. In general, the interaction between anonymization and data utility requires a deeper understanding within the context of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a framework composed of three key LLM-based components: a privacy evaluator, a utility evaluator and an optimization component, which work collaboratively to perform anonymization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing baselines, showing robustness in reducing the risk of re-identification while preserving greater data utility in downstream tasks. We provide detailed studies on these core modules. To consider large-scale and real-time applications, we investigate the distillation of the anonymization capabilities into lightweight models.

We observe that specific attention heads are closely tied to long-context retrieval, showing positive or negative correlation with retrieval scores, and adjusting the strength of these heads boosts the quality of LLMs in long context by a large margin. Built on this insight, we propose a learning-based mechanism that leverages generated data to emphasize these heads.

Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel *Neuron State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment* (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8524 with transferability. These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset.

Value principles serve as the foundation for clarifying alignment goals.Multiple sets of value principles have been proposed, such as HHH (helpful, honest, harmless) and instructions for data synthesis in reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF). However, most of them are heuristically crafted, without consideration of three primary challenges in practical LLM alignment: 1) Comprehensiveness to deal with diverse and even unforeseen scenarios in which LLMs could be applied; 2) Precision to provide LLMs with clear and actionable guidance in specific scenarios; and 3) Compatability to avoid internal contracts between principles.In this paper, we formalize quantitative metrics to evaluate value principles along the three desirable properties. Building on these metrics, we propose the Hierarchical Value Principle framework (HiVaP), which constructs a hierarchical principle set and retrieves principles tailored to each scenario in a cascading way, addressing above challenges.Experimental results validate that the three metrics capture the effectiveness of value principles for LLM alignment, and our HiVaP framework that enhances these metrics leads to superior alignment.

    "abstract": "Inference methods play an important role in eliciting the performance of large language models (LLMs). Currently, LLMs use inference methods utilizing generated multiple samples, which can be derived from Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) Decoding. Previous studies have conducted empirical analyses to clarify the improvements in generation performance achieved by MBR decoding and have reported various observations. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these findings remain uncertain. To address this, we offer a new theoretical interpretation of MBR decoding from the perspective of bias–diversity decomposition. In this interpretation, the error in the quality estimation of hypotheses by MBR decoding is decomposed into two main factors: bias, which considers the closeness between the utility function and human evaluation, and diversity, which represents the variability in the quality estimation of the utility function. The theoretical analysis reveals the difficulty of simultaneously improving bias and diversity, confirming the validity of enhancing MBR decoding performance by increasing diversity. Furthermore, we reveal that diversity can explain one aspect of inference scaling laws that describe performance improvement by increasing sample size. Moreover, experiments across multiple NLP tasks yielded results consistent with these theoretical characteristics. Our code is available at https://github.com/naist-nlp/mbr-bias-diversity",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at extracting and reasoning about information from images. Yet, their capacity to leverage internal knowledge about specific entities remains underexplored. This work investigates the disparity in model performance when answering factual questions about an entity described in text versus depicted in an image. Our results reveal a significant accuracy drop — reaching 18% for some models — when the entity is presented visually instead of textually. To study this gap we present PopVQA, a dataset which allows separating entity recognition and question answering, and use it to benchmark several models. We hypothesize that this decline arises from limitations in how information flows from image tokens to query tokens. Thus, we use mechanistic interpretability tools to reveal that, although image tokens are preprocessed by the vision encoder, meaningful information flow from these tokens occurs only in the much deeper layers. Furthermore, critical image processing happens in the language model's middle layers, allowing few layers for consecutive reasoning, highlighting a potential inefficiency in how the model utilizes its layers for reasoning. These insights shed light on the internal mechanics of VLMs and offer pathways for enhancing their reasoning capabilities. PopVQA can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/idoco/PopVQA",

Building on the theoretical analysis, we introduce the Self-Degraded Defense (SDD) framework. SDD encourages LLMs to produce high-quality but irrelevant responses to harmful prompts. When attackers attempt malicious fine-tuning, the general capability of the LLM aligned by SDD will significantly decrease, rendering it incapable of following harmful instructions.

Although recent advances in multimodal models have improved motion understanding,generating precise and sport-specific instruction remains challenging due to the highly domain-specific nature of sports and the need for informative guidance.

This approach enables both domain-knowledge learning and the acquisition of a coach-like thinking process that identifies movement errors effectively and provides feedback to explain how to improve. In this paper, weillustrate how CoachMe adapts well to specific sports such as skating and boxing by learning from general movements and then leveraging limited data. Experiments show that CoachMe provides high-quality instructions instead of directions merely in the tone of a coach but without critical information. CoachMe outperforms GPT-4o by 31.6% in G-Eval on figure skating and by 58.3% on boxing.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive results but face challenges from increasing model sizes and computational costs. Structured pruning reduces model size and speeds up inference but often causes uneven degradation across domains, leading to biased performance. To address this, we propose *DRPruning*, a method that dynamically adjusts the data distribution during training to restore balanced performance across heterogeneous and multi-tasking data. Experiments in monolingual and multilingual settings show that DRPruning surpasses similarly sized models in both pruning and continued pretraining over perplexity, downstream tasks, and instruction tuning. Further analysis demonstrates the robustness of DRPruning towards various domains and distribution shifts. Furthermore, DRPruning can determine optimal reference losses and data ratios automatically, suggesting potential for broader applications.

    "abstract": "Some statements have one well-defined continuation (e.g., \"the Eiffel Tower is in [Paris]\"), whereas others have a natural distribution over multiple options (e.g., \"the weighted coin flip was [Heads/Tails].\") We argue that language model (LM) outputs should capture these natural distributions. Our work specifically tests whether LM output probabilities are calibrated to numeric information within their textual contexts. For example, if the context (the prompt) concerns two equally likely options (e.g., heads or tails for a fair coin), the LM output probabilities should also be equal. Likewise, in a context with nonuniformly likely events (e.g., rolling a pair with two dice) an LM should output proportionate probabilities. However, we find that even in simple settings, the best LMs (1) are poorly calibrated and (2) have systematic biases: artifacts like word identity, word order, and word frequency all impact calibration. For example, ‘gpt-4o-mini‘ often picks the first of two options presented in the prompt regardless of the options' implied likelihoods, whereas ‘Llama-3.1-8B‘ picks the second. Models do not allocate probability mass among valid options in a calibrated manner",

While LLMs have improved at processing long inputs, MD contexts still present unique difficulties, including management of inter-document dependencies, redundancy, and incoherent structures. To address this challenge, we introduce MDCure, a scalable and effective instruction data generation framework to enhance the MD capabilities of LLMs without the computational cost of pre-training or reliance on human-annotated data. MDCure generates high-quality synthetic MD instruction data over sets of articles via targeted prompts. We also introduce MDCureRM, a cost-effective, MD-specific reward model to score and filter generated data based on their training utility for MD settings. MDCure is compatible with open- and closed-source models in addition to policy optimization methods such as PPO, enabling even small open- source models to surpass proprietary LLMs as strong generators of high-quality MD instruction data without further data filtering. With MDCure, we fine-tune a wide variety of LLMs up to 70B parameters in size from the FlanT5, Qwen2, and LLAMA3.1 model families. Extensive evaluations on a wide range of MD and long-context benchmarks spanning various tasks and domains show MDCure consistently improves performance over pre-trained baselines and base models by up to 75.1%",

Current methodologies, including automated metrics, human assessments, and LLM-based evaluations, predominantly focus on English, revealing a significant gap in multilingual evaluation frameworks. We introduce the Cross Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, an extensible framework that includes evaluator LLMs (Hercule) and a novel test set (Recon) specifically designed for multilingual evaluation. Our test set features 500 human-annotated instructions spanning various task capabilities along with human judgment scores across six languages. This would enable benchmarking of general-purpose multilingual LLMs and facilitate meta-evaluation of Evaluator LLMs. The proposed model, Hercule, is a cross-lingual evaluation model that addresses the scarcity of reference answers in the target language by learning to assign scores to responses based on easily available reference answers in English. Our experiments demonstrate that Hercule aligns more closely with human judgments compared to proprietary models, demonstrating the effectiveness of such cross-lingual evaluation in low resource scenarios. Further, it is also effective in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. This study is the first comprehensive examination of cross-lingual evaluation using LLMs, presenting a scalable and effective approach for multilingual assessment.

    "abstract": "Recent Large-Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on **heuristically hand-crafted metrics**, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel **optimization-based structural pruning** that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve the efficiency, our method **eliminates the back-propagation** through the LLM *per se* during the optimization, requiring only **the forward pass of the LLM**. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from the LLM loss, thus facilitating an efficient optimization via *policy gradient estimator* without back-propagation. As a result, our method is able to 1) *support global and heterogeneous pruning* (*i.e.*, our method automatically determines different redundancy for different layers), and 2) *optionally initialize with a metric-based method* (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral models using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in efficiency and effectiveness",

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong quantitative and qualitative reasoning abilities, and multi-agent LLM debates have shown promise in handling complex reasoning tasks by exploring diverse perspectives and reasoning paths. Inspired by this, we introduce Tree-of-Debate (ToD), a framework which converts scientific papers into LLM personas that debate their respective novelties. To emphasize structured, critical reasoning rather than focusing solely on outcomes, ToD dynamically constructs a debate tree, enabling fine-grained analysis of independent novelty arguments within scholarly articles.

This ensures alignment between memory and the article outline, improving both informativeness and verifiability while minimizing hallucinations. Additionally, a citation module is implemented to enhance traceability by linking every generated sentence to specific memory units.

In this work, we propose Class Distillation (ClaD), a novel training paradigm that targets the core challenge: distilling a small, well-defined target class from a highly diverse and heterogeneous background. ClaD integrates two key innovations: (i) a loss function informed by the structural properties of class distributions, based on Mahalanobis distance, and (ii) an interpretable decision algorithm optimized for class separation. Across three benchmark detection tasks – sexism, metaphor, and sarcasm – ClaD outperforms competitive baselines, and even with smaller language models and orders of magnitude fewer parameters, achieves performance comparable to several large language models. These results demonstrate ClaD as an efficient tool for pragmatic language understanding tasks that require gleaning a small target class from a larger heterogeneous background",

While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy.

    "abstract": "Designing optimal prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) is a complex and resource-intensive task, often requiring substantial human expertise. Existing approaches typically separate the optimization of prompt instructions and in-context learning examples, leading to incohesive, suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Cohesive In-Context Prompt Optimization framework that refines both prompt instructions and examples. In our formulation, coherence refers to the degree to which instructions and examples work synergistically to improve task performance—emerging as a byproduct of performance-driven optimization. However, formulating such an optimization in the discrete and high-dimensional space of natural language poses significant challenges in both convergence and computational efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce SEE, a scalable and efficient prompt optimization framework that adopts metaheuristic optimization principles and strategically balances exploration and exploitation to enhance optimization performance and achieve efficient convergence. SEE features a quad-phased design that alternates between global traversal (exploration) and local optimization (exploitation) and adaptively chooses LLM operators during the optimization process. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation across 35 benchmark tasks, and SEE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by a large margin, achieving an average performance gain of **13.94** while reducing computational costs by **58.67%**",

    "abstract": "Historical linguists have long written \"programs\" that convert reconstructed words in an ancestor language into their attested descendants via ordered string rewrite functions (called sound laws) However, writing these programs is time-consuming, motivating the development of automated Sound Law Induction (SLI) which we formulate as Programming by Examples (PBE) with Large Language Models (LLMs) in this paper. While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a \"similar distribution\" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results, we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research",

    "title": "Synergizing Unsupervised Episode Detection with LLMs for Large-Scale News Events",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art automatic event detection struggles with interpretability and adaptability to evolving large-scale key events—unlike episodic structures, which excel in these areas. Often overlooked, episodes represent cohesive clusters of core entities performing actions at a specific time and location; a partially ordered sequence of episodes can represent a key event. This paper introduces a novel task, **episode detection**, which identifies episodes within a news corpus of key event articles. Detecting episodes poses unique challenges, as they lack explicit temporal or locational markers and cannot be merged using semantic similarity alone. While large language models (LLMs) can aid with these reasoning difficulties, they suffer with long contexts typical of news corpora. To address these challenges, we introduce **EpiMine**, an unsupervised framework that identifies a key event's candidate episodes by leveraging natural episodic partitions in articles, estimated through shifts in discriminative term combinations. These candidate episodes are more cohesive and representative of true episodes, synergizing with LLMs to better interpret and refine them into final episodes. We apply EpiMine to our three diverse, real-world event datasets annotated at the episode level, where it achieves a 59.2% average gain across all metrics compared to baselines",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Claims made by individuals or entities are oftentimes nuanced and cannot be clearly labeled as entirely \"true\" or \"false\"—as is frequently the case with scientific and political claims. However, a claim (e.g., \"vaccine A is better than vaccine B\") can be dissected into its integral aspects and sub-aspects (e.g., efficacy, safety, distribution), which are individually easier to validate. This enables a more comprehensive, structured response that provides a well-rounded perspective on a given problem while also allowing the reader to prioritize specific angles of interest within the claim (e.g., safety towards children). Thus, we propose ClaimSpect, a retrieval-augmented generation-based framework for automatically constructing a hierarchy of aspects typically considered when addressing a claim and enriching them with corpus-specific perspectives. This structure hierarchically partitions an input corpus to retrieve relevant segments, which assist in discovering new sub-aspects. Moreover, these segments enable the discovery of varying perspectives towards an aspect of the claim (e.g., support, neutral, or oppose) and their respective prevalence (e.g., \"how many biomedical papers believe vaccine A is more transportable than B?\"). We apply ClaimSpect to a wide variety of real-world scientific and political claims featured in our constructed dataset, showcasing its robustness and accuracy in deconstructing a nuanced claim and representing perspectives within a corpus.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly being deployed as conversational assistants capable of performing complex real-world tasks through tool integration. This enhanced ability to interact with external systems and process various data sources, while powerful, introduces significant security vulnerabilities. In particular, indirect prompt injection attacks pose a critical threat, where malicious instructions embedded within external data sources can manipulate agents to deviate from user intentions. While existing defenses show promise, they struggle to maintain robust security while preserving task functionality. We propose a novel and orthogonal perspective that reframes agent security from preventing harmful actions to ensuring task alignment, requiring every agent action to serve user objectives. Based on this insight, we develop Task Shield, a test-time defense mechanism that systematically verifies whether each instruction and tool call contributes to user-specified goals. Through experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark, we demonstrate that Task Shield reduces attack success rates (2.07%) while maintaining high task utility (69.79%) on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming existing defenses in various real-world scenarios",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Watermarking AI-generated text is critical for combating misuse. Yet recent theoretical work argues that any watermark can be erased via random walk attacks that perturb text while preserving quality. However, such attacks rely on two key assumptions: (1) rapid mixing (watermarks dissolve quickly under perturbations) and (2) reliable quality preservation (automated quality oracles perfectly guide edits). Through large-scale experiments and human-validated assessments, we find mixing is slow: 100% of perturbed texts retain traces of their origin after hundreds of edits, defying rapid mixing. Oracles falter, as state-of-the-art quality detectors misjudge edits (77% accuracy), compounding errors during attacks. Ultimately, attacks underperform: automated walks remove watermarks just 26% of the time – dropping to 10% under human quality review. These findings challenge the inevitability of watermark removal. Instead, practical barriers – slow mixing and imperfect quality control – reveal watermarking to be far more robust than theoretical models suggest. The gap between idealized attacks and real-world feasibility underscores the need for stronger watermarking methods and more realistic attack models",

Traditional statistical methods for evacuation decision prediction fail to capture the complex and diverse behavioral logic of different individuals. In this work, for the first time, we introduce *FLARE*, short for facilitating LLM for advanced reasoning on wildfire evacuation decision prediction, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework that integrates behavioral theories and models to streamline the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and subsequently integrate with memory-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) module to provide accurate evacuation decision prediction and understanding. Our proposed method addresses the limitations of using existing LLMs for evacuation behavioral predictions, such as limited survey data, mismatching with behavioral theory, conflicting individual preferences, implicit and complex mental states, and intractable mental state-behavior mapping.

The intuition is that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the conversation's outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception—counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method—and with the eventual conversational trajectory—which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation between the counselor's response during pivotal moments and the eventual outcome of the session",

These explorations have endowed BERT-family with new roles and human expectations, showcasing their potential on par with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) large language models (LLMs). However, several certain shortcomings in previous BERT-family, such as the relatively sub-optimal training corpora, learning procedure, and model architecture, all impede the further advancement of these models for serving as general and competitive LLMs. Therefore, we aim to address these deficiencies in this paper. Our study not only introduces a more suitable pre-training task that helps BERT-family excel in wider applications to realize generality but also explores the integration of cutting-edge technologies into our model to further enhance their capabilities. Our final models, termed **Bi**directional **G**eneral **L**anguage **M**odels (**BiGLM**), exhibit performance levels comparable to current SOTA LLMs across a spectrum of tasks. Moreover, we conduct detailed analyses to study the effects of scaling and training corpora for BiGLM.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of scientific fields introduces challenges in organizing and retrieving scientific literature. While expert-curated taxonomies have traditionally addressed this need, the process is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, recent automatic taxonomy construction methods either (1) over-rely on a specific corpus, sacrificing generalizability, or (2) depend heavily on the general knowledge of large language models (LLMs) contained within their pre-training datasets, often overlooking the dynamic nature of evolving scientific domains. Additionally, these approaches fail to account for the multi-faceted nature of scientific literature, where a single research paper may contribute to multiple dimensions (e.g., methodology, new tasks, evaluation metrics, benchmarks). To address these gaps, we propose TaxoAdapt, a framework that dynamically adapts an LLM-generated taxonomy to a given corpus across multiple dimensions. TaxoAdapt performs iterative hierarchical classification, expanding both the taxonomy width and depth based on corpus' topical distribution. We demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of computer science conferences over the years to showcase its ability to structure and capture the evolution of scientific fields. As a multidimensional method, TaxoAdapt generates taxonomies that are 26.51% more granularity-preserving and 50.41% more coherent than the most competitive baselines judged by LLMs",

Subsequently, based on the analyses of the limitations of previous inference algorithms, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to conduct efficient refinements without performance declines.

We merge frequent subword sequences in a batch, then apply a pre-trained embedding-prediction hypernetwork to compute the token embeddings on-the-fly. For encoder-style models (e.g., XLM-R), this on average reduces token sequence lengths by >20% across 14 languages while degrading performance by less than 2%. The same method applied to pre-filling and scoring in decoder-style models (e.g., Mistral-7B) results in minimal performance degradation at up to 17% reduction in sequence length.

In this work, we contend that principled content selection is a simple way to increase source coverage on this task. As opposed to prompting an LLM to perform the summarization in a single step, we explicitly divide the task into three steps—(1) reducing document collections to atomic key points, (2) using determinantal point processes (DPP) to perform select key points that prioritize diverse content, and (3) rewriting to the final summary. By combining prompting steps, for extraction and rewriting, with principled techniques, for content selection, we consistently improve source coverage on the DiverseSumm benchmark across various LLMs. Finally, we also show that by incorporating relevance to a provided user intent into the DPP kernel, we can generate _personalized_ summaries that cover _relevant_ source information while retaining coverage",

In response, we introduce *iterative autoformalisation*, an approach that iteratively refines theorem prover formalisation to mitigate errors, thereby increasing the execution rate on the Lean prover from 60% to 87%. Building upon that, we introduce *Theorem Prover as a Judge (TP-as-a-Judge)*, a method that employs theorem prover formalisation to rigorously assess LLM intermediate reasoning, effectively integrating autoformalisation with synthetic data generation. Finally, we present *Reinforcement Learning from Theorem Prover Feedback (RLTPF),* a framework that replaces human annotation with theorem prover feedback in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Across multiple LLMs, applying *TP-as-a-Judge* and *RLTPF* improves benchmarks with only 3,508 samples, achieving 5.56% accuracy gain on Mistral-7B for MultiArith, 6.00% on Llama-2-7B for SVAMP, and 3.55% on Llama-3.1-8B for AQUA",

    "title": "Measuring the Effect of Transcription Noise on Downstream Language Understanding Tasks",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of recorded human speech, spoken language understanding (SLU) is essential for its efficient processing. In order to process the speech, it is commonly transcribed using automatic speech recognition technology. This speech-to-text transition introduces errors into the transcripts, which subsequently propagate to downstream NLP tasks, such as dialogue summarization. While it is known that transcript noise affects downstream tasks, a general-purpose and systematic approach to analyzing its effects across different noise severities and types has not been addressed. We propose a configurable framework for assessing task models in diverse noisy settings, and for examining the impact of transcript-cleaning techniques. The framework facilitates the investigation of task model behavior, which can in turn support the development of effective SLU solutions. We exemplify the utility of our framework on three SLU tasks and four task models, offering insights regarding the effect of transcript noise on tasks in general and models in particular. For instance, we find that task models can tolerate a certain level of noise, and are affected differently by the types of errors in the transcript",

It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves a 5.2% improvement in the F1 score over the current best result in the chart generation task. Additionally, METAL improves chart generation performance by 11.33% over Direct Prompting with LLaMA-3.2-11B.Furthermore, the METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithm of computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens",

However, the heuristics that guide this sampling process remain under-explored. We study this sampling behavior and show that this underlying heuristics resembles that of human decision-making: comprising a descriptive component (reflecting statistical norm) and a prescriptive component (implicit ideal encoded in the LLM) of a concept. We show that this deviation of a sample from the statistical norm towards a prescriptive component consistently appears in concepts across diverse real-world domains like public health, and economic trends. To further illustrate the theory, we demonstrate that concept prototypes in LLMs are affected by prescriptive norms, similar to the concept of normality in humans. Through case studies and comparison with human studies, we illustrate that in real-world applications, the shift of samples toward an ideal value in LLMs' outputs can result in significantly biased decision-making, raising ethical concerns",

Our approach leverages a two-phase fine-tuning strategy utilizing carefully constructed mismatched and clean datasets. Through extensive evaluation across multiple LLM architectures and fingerprinting methods, we demonstrate that MEraser achieves complete fingerprinting removal while maintaining model performance with minimal training data of fewer than 1,000 samples. Furthermore, we introduce a transferable erasure mechanism that enables effective fingerprinting removal across different models without repeated training. In conclusion, our approach provides a practical solution for fingerprinting removal in LLMs, reveals critical vulnerabilities in current fingerprinting techniques, and establishes comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for developing more resilient model protection methods in the future",

Leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs), VISA identifies the evidence and highlights the exact regions that support the generated answers with bounding boxes in the retrieved document screenshots.

    "abstract": "The widespread success of LLMs on NLP benchmarks has been accompanied by concerns that LLMs function primarily as stochastic parrots that reproduce texts similar to what they saw during pre-training, often erroneously. But what is the nature of their errors, and do these errors exhibit any regularities? In this work, we examine irrelevant context hallucinations, in which models integrate misleading contextual cues into their predictions. Through behavioral analysis, we show that these errors result from a structured yet flawed mechanism that we term _class-based (mis)generalization_, in which models combine abstract class cues with features extracted from the query or context to derive answers. Furthermore, mechanistic interpretability experiments on Llama-3, Mistral, and Pythia across 39 factual recall relation types reveal that this behavior is reflected in the model's internal computations: (i) abstract class representations are constructed in lower layers before being refined into specific answers in higher layers, (ii) feature selection is governed by two competing circuits — one prioritizing direct query-based reasoning, the other incorporating contextual cues — whose relative influences determine the final output. Our findings provide a more nuanced perspective on the stochastic parrot argument: through form-based training, LLMs can exhibit generalization leveraging abstractions, albeit in unreliable ways based on contextual cues — what we term _stochastic chameleons_",

Specifically, we develop a new paradigm of Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning (MAPoRL). In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses and engage in discussions to collaboratively enhance the final response output; the final output is then scored by a verifier, where the scores serve as the reward and is maximized through multi-agent RL. Additionally, MAPoRL also reshapes the reward above with additional incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive outputs in the discussions. A key novelty from most existing LLM post-training paradigms is the advocacy of co-training multiple LLMs together, and the use of RL for better generalization. Accompanied by a few analytical insights, our experiments show that training single LLMs solely is insufficient for encouraging collaboration, while multi-agent co-training can significantly enhance the collaboration performance across multiple datasets, with generalization to unseen domains, compared to that of multiple LLMs before post-training",

Existing solutions, such as sparse attention, hierarchical models, and key sentence extraction, partially address the issue but still fall short when the input sequence is exceptionally lengthy. To address this challenge, we propose **IRIS** (**I**nterpretable **R**etrieval-Augmented Classification for long **I**nterspersed Document **S**equences), a novel, lightweight framework that utilizes retrieval to efficiently classify long documents while enhancing interpretability. IRIS segments documents into chunks, stores their embeddings in a vector database, and retrieves those most relevant to a given task using learnable query vectors. A linear attention mechanism then aggregates the retrieved embeddings for classification, allowing the model to process arbitrarily long documents without increasing computational cost and remaining trainable on a single GPU. Our experiments across six datasets show that IRIS achieves comparable performance to baseline models on standard benchmarks, and excels in three clinical note disease risk prediction tasks where documents are extremely long and key information is sparse. Furthermore, IRIS provides global interpretability by revealing a clear summary of key risk factors identified by the model. These findings highlight the potential of IRIS as an efficient and interpretable solution for long-document classification, particularly in healthcare applications where both performance and explainability are crucial",

We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities",

    "abstract": "Real-world open-domain questions can be complex, especially when answering them requires integrating information from multiple sources. Effectively identifying the necessary information involves *aligning* it with the available data and its organization. However, existing RAG solutions address the alignment problem in a limited manner. Using off-the-shelf LLMs for question decomposition lacks awareness of the available data and its structure, often resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. Alternatively, iteratively generating follow-up queries and interacting with the data collection, as explored in agentic RAG approaches, shows potential but is often *inefficient* since each successive query depends on previous results rather than being guided by the overall organization of the available data. To address the *alignment* problem, we introduce an LLM-based retrieval method — ARM, designed to better align questions with the organization of the data collection. Instead of solely matching query utterance, ARM explores *relationships among data objects*, enabling a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries. Experimental results demonstrate that ARM significantly outperforms existing RAG methods on various complex open-domain QA tasks across multiple modalities, achieving superior retrieval performance and downstream accuracy while significantly lowering monetary costs",

Current models often struggle with efficient navigation and action execution due to limited visibility and understanding of web structures. Our proposed R2D2 framework addresses these challenges by integrating two paradigms: Remember and Reflect. The Remember paradigm utilizes a replay buffer that aids agents in reconstructing the web environment dynamically, thus enabling the formulation of a detailed \"map\" of previously visited pages. This helps in reducing navigational errors and optimizing the decision-making process during web interactions. Conversely, the Reflect paradigm allows agents to learn from past mistakes by providing a mechanism for error analysis and strategy refinement, enhancing overall task performance. We evaluate R2D2 using the WEBARENA benchmark, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods, including a 50% reduction in navigation errors and a threefold increase in task completion rates. Our findings suggest that a combination of memory-enhanced navigation and reflective learning promisingly advances the capabilities of web agents, potentially benefiting various applications such as automated customer service and personal digital assistants",

    "abstract": "Existing studies on fairness are largely Western-focused, making them inadequate for culturally diverse countries such as India. To address this gap, we introduce INDIC-BIAS, a comprehensive India-centric benchmark designed to evaluate fairness of LLMs across 85 identity groups encompassing diverse castes, religions, regions, and tribes. We first consult domain experts to curate over 1,800 socio-cultural topics spanning behaviors and situations, where biases and stereotypes are likely to emerge. Grounded in these topics, we generate and manually validate 20,000 real-world scenario templates to probe LLMs for fairness. We structure these templates into three evaluation tasks: plausibility, judgment, and generation. Our evaluation of 14 popular LLMs on these tasks reveals strong negative biases against marginalized identities, with models frequently reinforcing common stereotypes. Additionally, we find that models struggle to mitigate bias even when explicitly asked to rationalize their decision. Our evaluation provides evidence of both allocative and representational harms that current LLMs could cause towards Indian identities, calling for a more cautious usage in practical applications. We release INDIC-BIAS as an open-source benchmark to advance research on benchmarking and mitigating biases and stereotypes in the Indian context",

Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM_Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR-LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM_Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training.

Prior SRL benchmarks often miss implicit arguments, leading to incomplete understanding. To address this, we introduce Implicit-VidSRL, a dataset that necessitates inferring implicit and explicit arguments from contextual information in multimodal cooking procedures. Our proposed dataset benchmarks multimodal models' contextual reasoning, requiring entity tracking through visual changes in recipes. We study recent multimodal LLMs and reveal that they struggle to predict implicit arguments of what and where/with from multi-modal procedural data given the verb.

Prompt guard models, though effective in defense, suffer from over-defense—falsely flagging benign inputs as malicious due to trigger word bias. To address this issue, we introduce NotInject, an evaluation dataset that systematically measures over-defense across various prompt guard models. NotInject contains 339 benign samples enriched with trigger words common in prompt injection attacks, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Our results show that state-of-the-art models suffer from over-defense issues, with accuracy dropping close to random guessing levels (60%). To mitigate this, we propose PIGuard, a novel prompt guard model that incorporates a new training strategy, Mitigating Over-defense for Free (MOF), which significantly reduces the bias on trigger words.

In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance.CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Flickr30K, and Conceptual 12M across five CLIP downstream tasks, as well as an evaluation on diffusion models, demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively removes designated associations from multimodal samples in downstream tasks, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning",

    "abstract": "In spoken communication, information is transmitted not only via words, but also through a rich array of non-verbal signals, including prosody—the non-segmental auditory features of speech. Do these different communication channels carry distinct information? Prior work has shown that the information carried by prosodic features is substantially redundant with that carried by the surrounding words. Here, we systematically examine the time scale of this relationship, studying how it varies with the length of past and future contexts. We find that a word's prosodic features require an extended past context (3-8 words across different features) to be reliably predicted. Given that long-scale contextual information decays in memory, prosody may facilitate communication by adding information that is locally unique. We also find that a word's prosodic features show some redundancy with future words, but only with a short scale of 1-2 words, consistent with reports of incremental short-term planning in language production. Thus, prosody may facilitate communication by helping listeners predict upcoming material. In tandem, our results highlight potentially distinct roles that prosody plays in facilitating integration of words into past contexts and in helping predict upcoming words",

Distillation is one technique to solve this problem through either knowledge distillation or task distillation. Both distillation approaches train small models to imitate specific features of LLMs, but they all neglect basic reading education for small models on generic texts that are unrelated to downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose basic reading distillation (BRD) which educates a small model to imitate LLMs basic reading behaviors, such as named entity recognition, question raising and answering, on each sentence. After such basic education, we apply the small model on various tasks including language inference benchmarks and BIG-bench tasks. It shows that the small model can outperform or perform comparable to over 20x bigger LLMs. Analysis reveals that BRD effectively influences the probability distribution of the small model, and has orthogonality to either knowledge distillation or task distillation",

To bridge this gap, we presents a comprehensive investigation of uncertainty calibration for quantized LLMs in this work. Specifically, we propose an analytic method to estimate the upper bound of calibration error (UBCE) for LLMs. Our method separately discusses the calibration error of the model's correct and incorrect predictions, indicating a theoretical improvement of calibration error caused by the weight quantization. Our study demonstrates that quantized models consistently exhibit worse calibration performance than full-precision models, supported by consistent analysis across multiple LLMs and datasets. To address the calibration issues of quantized models, we propose a novel method of post calibration for recovering the calibration performance of quantized models through soft-prompt tuning. Specifically, we inject soft tokens to quantized models after the embedding layers, and optimize these tokens to recover the calibration error caused by the weight quantization. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate our effectiveness in improving the uncertainty calibration of quantized LLMs, facilitating more reliable weight quantization in resource-constrained environments",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Reading is a process that unfolds across space and time. Standard modeling approaches, however, overlook much of the spatio-temporal dynamics involved in reading by relying on aggregated reading measurements—typically only focusing on fixation durations—and employing models with strong simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we propose a generative model that captures not only how long fixations last, but also where they land and when they occur. To this end, we model reading scanpaths via two conditionally independent distributions: one for fixation location and timing, and another for fixation duration.The location (and timing) of fixation shifts, so-called saccades, are modeled using a spatio-temporal Hawkes process, which captures how each fixation excites the probability of a new fixation occurring near it in time and space. Empirically, our Hawkes process model exhibits higher likelihood on held-out reading data than baselines. The duration time of fixation events is modeled as a function of fixation-specific features convolved across time, thus capturing non-stationary delayed effects. We find that convolution-based approaches demonstrate weak predictive power when modeling disaggregated fixation durations. Similarly, our analysis of surprisal theory on disaggregated data reveals limited effectiveness in predicting both where fixations occur and how long they last",

However, as ICL demonstrations increase from a few to many, performance tends to plateau and eventually decline. We identify two primary causes for this trend: the suboptimal negative log-likelihood (NLL) optimization objective and the incremental data noise. To address these issues, we introduce DrICL, a novel optimization method that enhances model performance through Differentiated and Reweighting objectives. Globally, DrICL utilizes differentiated learning to optimize the NLL objective, ensuring that many-shot performance surpasses zero-shot levels. Locally, it dynamically adjusts the weighting of many-shot demonstrations by leveraging cumulative advantages inspired by reinforcement learning, thereby mitigating the impact of noisy data.Recognizing the lack of multi-task datasets with diverse many-shot distributions, we develop the Many-Shot ICL Benchmark (ICL-50)-a large-scale benchmark of 50 tasks that cover shot numbers from 1 to 350 within sequences of up to 8,000 tokens-for both fine-tuning and evaluation purposes.Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs enhanced with DrICL achieve significant improvements in many-shot setups across various tasks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios.We release the code and dataset hoping to facilitate further research in many-shot ICL",

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG), while effectively integrating external knowledge to address the inherent limitations of large language models (LLMs), can be hindered by imperfect retrieval that contain irrelevant, misleading, or even malicious information. Previous studies have rarely connected the behavior of RAG through joint analysis, particularly regarding error propagation coming from imperfect retrieval and potential conflicts between LLMs' internal knowledge and external sources. Through comprehensive and controlled analyses under realistic conditions, we find that imperfect retrieval augmentation is inevitable, common, and harmful. We identify the knowledge conflicts between LLM-internal and external knowledge from retrieval as a bottleneck to overcome imperfect retrieval in the post-retrieval stage of RAG. To address this, we propose Astute RAG, a novel RAG approach designed to be resilient to imperfect retrieval augmentation. It adaptively elicits essential information from LLMs' internal knowledge, iteratively consolidates internal and external knowledge with source-awareness, and finalizes the answer according to information reliability. Our experiments with Gemini and Claude demonstrate the superior performance of Astute RAG compared to previous robustness-enhanced RAG approaches. Specifically, Astute RAG is the only RAG method that achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing conventional use of LLMs under the worst-case scenario. Further analysis reveals the effectiveness of Astute RAG in resolving knowledge conflicts, thereby improving the trustworthiness of RAG",

Meanwhile, existing safety alignment methods predominantly rely on the fine-tuning process, which inadvertently leads to the increased complexity and computational resources required. To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with Low-Rank Safety Subspace Fusison. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model's general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs through linear arithmetic. Additionally, to account for the varying encoding densities of safety information across different layers of LLMs, we propose a novel metric called safety singular value entropy. This metric quantifies the encoding density and allows for the dynamic computation of the safety-critical rank for each safety vector. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed post-hoc alignment method can effectively restore the safety alignment of fine-tuned models with minimal impact on their performance on downstream tasks",

Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities as autonomous agents when augmented with external tools. Equipped with fixed tool sets, LLMs struggle with addressing diverse user inquiries in open-world tasks. To evaluate and boost the performance of LLMs in dealing with complex demands in the real-world, we propose open-world function calling, where LLMs need to retrieve suitable tools from a pre-defined external tool library and use retrieved tools to resolve the user's problem. We introduce Meta-Tool, a versatile and plug-and-play tool retrieval system as the access of LLMs to external tool library. Drawing inspiration from the myriad of enhanced approaches associated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Meta-Tool employs a hypothesize-retrieve-invoke framework. We further propose Meta-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs in open-world function calling and associated tasks. Meta-Bench encompasses 2,800 dialogues and 7,361 tools, spanning ten distinct scenarios to provide robust and diverse test categories. In conjunction, we present MT-LLaMA, a finetuned version of LLaMA-3.1, which exhibits remarkable performance improvements. Our empirical experiments reveal that Meta-Tool significantly enhances the ability of advanced LLMs to retrieve and leverage the most suitable tools compared to previous tool retrieval methods. Moreover, our fine-tuning enables even smaller-sized LLMs to achieve comparable even exceeding results to GPT-4o. Both the benchmark and the model are made publicly available at https://github.com/qinshengqian/Meta-Tool to foster further research and development in the field",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks. Despite great success, recent studies show that LVLMs encounter substantial limitations when engaging with visual graphs. To study the reason behind these limitations, we propose VGCure, a comprehensive benchmark covering 22 tasks for examining the fundamental graph understanding and reasoning capacities of LVLMs. Extensive evaluations conducted on 14 LVLMs reveal that LVLMs are weak in basic graph understanding and reasoning tasks, particularly those concerning relational or structurally complex information. Based on this observation, we propose a structure-aware fine-tuning framework to enhance LVLMs with structure learning abilities through three self-supervised learning tasks.

Unlike conventional visual grounding tasks that use referring expressions (REs) as inputs, entity grounding relies solely on entity names and types, presenting a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce a novel **I**terative **S**elf-**R**efinement (**ISR**) scheme to enhance the multimodal large language model's capability to generate high quality REs for the given entities as explicit contextual clues. This training scheme, inspired by human learning dynamics and human annotation processes, enables the MLLM to iteratively generate and refine REs by learning from successes and failures, guided by outcome rewards from a visual grounding model. This iterative cycle of self-refinement avoids overfitting to fixed annotations and fosters continued improvement in referring expression generation.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically learn visual capacity through visual instruction tuning, involving updates to both a projector and their LLM backbones. Inspired by the concept of a visual region in the human brain, we investigate the existence of an analogous visual region within LLMs that functions as a cognitive core, and explore the potential of efficient training of LVLMs via selective layers tuning. Using Bunny-Llama-3-8B-V for detailed analysis and other three LVLMs for validation across diverse visual and textual tasks, we find that selectively updating 25% of LLMs layers, when sparsely and uniformly distributed, can preserve nearly 99% of visual performance and maintain or improve textual task results, while effectively reducing training time. Based on this targeted training approach, we further propose a novel visual region-based pruning paradigm, removing non-critical layers outside the visual region, which can achieve minimal performance loss. This study offers an effective and efficient strategy for LVLM training and inference by activating a layer-wise visual region within LLMs, which proves consistently effective across different models",

Motivated by this, we introduce a novel joint Cross-lingual and Cross-modal Hallucinations benchmark (CCHall) to fill this gap. Specifically, CCHall simultaneously incorporates both cross-lingual and cross-modal hallucination scenarios, which can be used to assess the cross-lingual and cross-modal capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on CCHall, exploring both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs. The experimental results highlight that current LLMs still struggle with CCHall.

We evaluate TestNUC across eight diverse datasets, spanning intent classification, topic mining, domain discovery, and emotion detection, demonstrating its consistent superiority over baseline methods such as standard prompting and self-consistency.

Additionally, mapping model attention to complete entity spans yields coherent, clinically meaningful explanations, capturing coding-relevant modifiers such as acuity and laterality.

Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JITVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code.

In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance. Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs, reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly mitigates catastrophic forgetting",

However, these methods struggle to generalize to real-world scenarios, where questionable information spans diverse domains and is often modality-incomplete due to factors such as upload degradation or missing metadata. To address these challenges, we introduce two real-world multi-domain news video benchmarks that reflect modality incompleteness and propose IMOL, an incomplete-modality-tolerant learning framework for multi-domain fake news video detection. Inspired by cognitive theories suggesting that humans infer missing modalities through cross-modal guidance and retrieve relevant knowledge from memory for reference, IMOL employs a hierarchical transferable information integration strategy. This consists of two key phases: (1) leveraging cross-modal consistency to reconstruct missing modalities and (2) refining sample-level transferable knowledge through cross-sample associative reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMOL significantly enhances the performance and robustness of multi-domain fake news video detection while effectively generalizing to unseen domains under incomplete modality conditions",

In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the automated deception detection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) across diverse domains.

We systematically analyze the effectiveness of different experimental setups for deception detection, including zero-shot and few-shot approaches with random or similarity-based in-context example selection. Our findings indicate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on textual deception detection, whereas LMMs struggle to fully leverage multimodal cues, particularly in real-world settings. Additionally, we analyze the impact of auxiliary features, such as non-verbal gestures, video summaries, and evaluate the effectiveness of different promptingstrategies, such as direct label generation and post-hoc reasoning generation. Experiments unfold that reasoning-based predictions do not consistently improve performance over direct classification, contrary to the expectations",

    "title": "Analyzing and Mitigating Inconsistency in Discrete Speech Tokens for Neural Codec Language Models",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Building upon advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), the field of audio processing has seen increased interest in training speech generation tasks with discrete speech token sequences. However, directly discretizing speech by neural audio codecs often results in sequences that fundamentally differ from text sequences. Unlike text, where text token sequences are deterministic, discrete speech tokens can exhibit significant variability based on contextual factors, while still producing perceptually identical audio segments. We refer to this phenomenon as Discrete Representation Inconsistency (DRI). This inconsistency can lead to a single speech segment being represented by multiple divergent sequences, which creates confusion in neural codec language models and results in poor generated speech. In this paper, we quantitatively analyze the DRI phenomenon within popular audio tokenizers such as EnCodec. Our approach effectively mitigates the DRI phenomenon of the neural audio codec. Furthermore, extensive experiments on the neural codec language model over LibriTTS and large-scale MLS dataset (44,000 hours) demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "One of the research focuses of large language models (LLMs) is the ability to generate action plans. Recent studies have revealed that the performance of LLMs can be significantly improved by integrating external tools. Based on this, we propose a benchmark framework called PlanningArena, which aims to simulate real application scenarios and provide a series of apps and API tools that may be involved in the actual planning process. This framework adopts a modular task structure and combines user portrait analysis to evaluate the ability of LLMs in correctly selecting tools, logical reasoning in complex scenarios, and parsing user information. In addition, we deeply diagnose the task execution effect of LLMs from both macro and micro levels. The experimental results show that even the most outstanding GPT-4o and DeepSeekV3 models only achieved a total score of 56.5% and 41.9% in PlanningArena, respectively, indicating that current LLMs still face challenges in logical reasoning, context memory, and tool calling when dealing with different structures, scenarios, and their complexity. Through this benchmark, we further explore the path to optimize LLMs to perform planning tasks",

    "title": "FocusLLM: Precise Understanding of Long Context by Dynamic Condensing",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Empowering LLMs with the ability to precisely understand long contexts is crucial for many downstream applications. However, handling long contexts with conventional transformer architecture requires substantial training and inference resources. Existing context condensing methods cannot accurately understand the full context, as there is a considerable amount of information loss in the condensing process. To address these issues, we present **FocusLLM**, a framework designed to extend the fixed context length of any decoder-only LLM, allowing the model to focus on relevant information from very long sequences. FocusLLM first divides long text input into chunks based on the model's original context length. It then employs the **_dynamic condensing_** process to distill crucial information from each chunk. Ultimately, through the novel **_parallel decoding_** mechanism, FocusLLM can integrate the extracted information into its local context. FocusLLM stands out for great training efficiency and versatility: trained with an 8K input length and with much less training cost than previous methods, FocusLLM exhibits superior performance across downstream tasks and maintains strong language modeling ability when handling extensive long texts, even up to 400K tokens.

    "abstract": "Text embedding models are essential for various natural language processing tasks, enabling the effective encoding of semantic information into dense vector representations.

Extensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses the distribution shift issue, remarkably enhancing the safety performance while avoiding about 300x computational overheads",

    "title": "Subtle Errors in Reasoning: Preference Learning via Error-injected Self-editing",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited strong mathematical reasoning prowess, tackling tasks ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced competition-level problems. However, frequently occurring subtle yet critical errors, such as miscalculations or incorrect substitutions, limit the LLMs' full potential. Existing studies to improve mathematical ability typically involve applying preference learning to step-wise solution pairs. Although these methods leverage samples of varying granularity to mitigate reasoning errors, they overlook critical subtle errors. In this work, we propose a novel preference learning framework called eRror-Injected Self-Editing (RISE), which injects predefined subtle errors into pivotal tokens in reasoning or computation steps to construct hard pairs for error mitigation. In detail, RISE uses the LLM itself to edit a small number of tokens in the solution, injecting designed subtle errors. Then, pairs composed of self-edited solutions and their corresponding correct ones, along with pairs of correct and incorrect solutions obtained through sampling, are used together for subtle error-aware DPO training. Compared with other preference learning methods, RISE further refines the training objective without requiring fine-grained sampling or preference annotation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RISE, with preference learning on Qwen2-7B-Instruct yielding notable improvements of 3.0% on GSM8K and 7.9% on MATH with only 4.5K training samples. Moreover, the effect of error mitigation extends from mathematical reasoning to logical reasoning and code generation",

Truthfulness evaluations of large language models (LLMs) have primarily been focused on English. However, the ability of LLMs to maintain truthfulness across languages remains under-explored. Our study evaluates 12 state-of-the-art open LLMs, comparing base and instruction-tuned models using human evaluation, multiple-choice metrics, and LLM-as-a-Judge scoring. Our findings reveal that, while LLMs perform best in English and worst in Basque (the lowest-resourced language), overall truthfulness discrepancies across languages are smaller than anticipated. Furthermore, we show that LLM-as-a-Judge correlates more closely with human judgments than multiple-choice metrics, and that informativeness plays a critical role in truthfulness assessment. Our results also indicate that machine translation provides a viable approach for extending truthfulness benchmarks to additional languages, offering a scalable alternative to professional translation. Finally, we observe that universal knowledge questions are better handled across languages than context- and time-dependent ones, highlighting the need for truthfulness evaluations that account for cultural and temporal variability.

To address this, we propose Ordered CommonGen, a benchmark designed to evaluate the compositional generalization and instruction-following abilities of LLMs. This benchmark measures ordered coverage to assess whether concepts are generated in the specified order, enabling a simultaneous evaluation of both abilities. We conducted a comprehensive analysis using 36 LLMs and found that, while LLMs generally understand the intent of instructions, biases toward specific concept order patterns often lead to low-diversity outputs or identical results even when the concept order is altered.

The agent reaches the target progressively by achieving sub-goals with different capacities of the LLM. Additionally, a global memory module storing historical trajectories into a topological graph is developed to simplify navigation for visited targets.

    "abstract": "Current vision-language models (VLMs) understand complex vision-text tasks by extracting overall semantic information from large-scale cross-modal associations. However, extracting from large-scale cross-modal associations often smooths out semantic details and requires large computations, limiting multimodal fine-grained understanding performance and efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes a detail-oriented prompt learning (DoPL) method for vision-language models to implement fine-grained multi-modal semantic alignment with merely 0.25M trainable parameters. According to the low-entropy information concentration theory, DoPL explores shared interest tokens from text-vision correlations and transforms them into alignment weights to enhance text prompt and vision prompt via detail-oriented prompt generation. It effectively guides the current frozen layer to extract fine-grained text-vision alignment cues. Furthermore, DoPL constructs detail-oriented prompt generation for each frozen layer to implement layer-by-layer localization of fine-grained semantic alignment, achieving precise understanding in complex vision-text tasks. DoPL performs well in parameter-efficient fine-grained semantic alignment with only 0.12% tunable parameters for vision-language models. The state-of-the-art results over the previous parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and full fine-tuning approaches on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DoPL in complex multi-modal tasks",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Artificial agents are increasingly central to complex interactions and decision-making tasks, yet aligning their behaviors with desired human values remains an open challenge. In this work, we investigate how human-like personality traits influence agent behavior and performance within text-based interactive environments. We introduce PANDA: Personality Adapted Neural Decision Agents, a novel method for projecting human personality traits onto agents to guide their behavior. To induce personality in a text-based game agent, (i) we train a personality classifier to identify what personality type the agent's actions exhibit, and (ii) we integrate the personality profiles directly into the agent's policy-learning pipeline. By deploying agents embodying 16 distinct personality types across 25 text-based games and analyzing their trajectories, we demonstrate that an agent's action decisions can be guided toward specific personality profiles. Moreover, certain personality types, such as those characterized by higher levels of Openness, display marked advantages in performance. These findings underscore the promise of personality-adapted agents for fostering more aligned, effective, and human-centric decision-making in interactive environments",

However, challenges such as interdisciplinary complexity and high costs with limited returns hinder progress, leading to a shortage of experts and insufficient technological support. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise across various fields, their application in seed science remains limited due to the scarcity of digital resources, complex gene-trait relationships, and the lack of standardized benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce SeedBench—the first multi-task benchmark specifically designed for seed science. Developed in collaboration with domain experts, SeedBench focuses on seed breeding and simulates key aspects of modern breeding processes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 26 leading LLMs, encompassing proprietary, open-source, and domain-specific fine-tuned models.

    "abstract": "We present -Stance, a large-scale dataset of stances involved in legal argumentation.-Stance contains stance-annotated argument pairs, semi-automatically mined from millions of examples of U.S. judges citing precedent in context using citation signals. The dataset aims to facilitate work on the legal argument stance classification task, which involves assessing whether a case summary strengthens or weakens a legal argument (polarity) and to what extent (intensity). To assess the complexity of this task, we evaluate various existing NLP methods, including zero-shot prompting proprietary large language models (LLMs), and supervised fine-tuning of smaller open-weight language models (LMs) on 𝛿-Stance. Our findings reveal that although prompting proprietary LLMs can help predict stance polarity, supervised model fine-tuning on -Stance is necessary to distinguish intensity. We further find that alternative strategies such as domain-specific pretraining and zero-shot prompting using masked LMs remain insufficient. Beyond our dataset's utility for the legal domain, we further find that fine-tuning small LMs on -Stance improves their performance in other domains. Finally, we study how temporal changes in signal definition can impact model performance, highlighting the importance of careful data curation for downstream tasks by considering the historical and sociocultural context.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Retrieval, Dependency Recognition, and Reorder for data synthesis (Re3Syn), which leverages semantic similarity to retrieve relevant documents and form several batches. Within each batch, the framework comprehensively recognizes dependency and utilizes them, along with a reorder algorithm, to organize the short documents into coherent long-context data.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the \"eyes\" of human perception while neglecting the \"ears\", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with \"eyes and ears\" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation (M3C), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the M3C, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents",

In the era of rapidly growing multimodal content and social media, MCR is particularly crucial for interpreting user interactions and bridging text-visual references to improve communication and personalization. However, MCR research for real-world dialogues remains unexplored due to the lack of sufficient data resources. To address this gap, we introduce TikTalkCoref, the first Chinese multimodal coreference dataset for social media in real-world scenarios, derived from the popular Douyin short-video platform.

It leverages contrastive training with taxonomy-aware hard negative sampling and employs adaptive inference with dynamic thresholds.TACLR offers three key advantages: (1) it effectively handles implicit and OOD values while producing normalized outputs; (2) it scales to thousands of categories, tens of thousands of attributes, and millions of values; and (3) it supports efficient inference for high-load industrial deployment.Extensive experiments on proprietary and public datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of TACLR.

To that end, we introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of human-written quality.

To achieve adaptive cross-modality heterogeneous knowledge learning, we designed two components: Cross-Modality Video-Text Knowledge Alignment (CVKA) and Audio Modality Feature Adaptive Extraction (AFAE). They extract and aggregate features by exploring inter-modality correlations. By leveraging abundant cross-modality knowledge, our approach improves the discrimination between normal and anomalous segments.

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However, existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective. This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers. Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp achieves a speedup of 1.3× ∼ 1.7× on LLaMA3 series models without altering the original distribution of the generated text",

However, these self-collected data inevitably contain intermediate failed actions caused by attempting physically infeasible behaviors and/or hallucinations.

In this paper, we propose a failed action-aware objective that suppresses the negative impact of failed actions during training by assigning zero return based on textual feedback. Building on this objective, we introduce a perturbation method that leverages unsuccessful trajectories to construct new successful ones that share the same goal. This allows agents to benefit from diverse experiences without further interaction with the environment.

However, language typically does not maintain a strictly uniform information rate; instead, it fluctuates around a global average. These fluctuations are often explained by factors such as syntactic constraints, stylistic choices, or audience design. In this work, we explore an alternative perspective: that these fluctuations may be influenced by an implicit linguistic pressure towards periodicity, where the information rate oscillates at regular intervals, potentially across multiple frequencies simultaneously. We apply harmonic regression and introduce a novel extension called time scaling to detect and test for such periodicity in information contours. Analyzing texts in English, Spanish, German, Dutch, Basque, and Brazilian Portuguese, we find consistent evidence of periodic patterns in information rate. Many dominant frequencies align with discourse structure, suggesting these oscillations reflect meaningful linguistic organization. Beyond highlighting the connection between information rate and discourse structure, our approach offers a general framework for uncovering structural pressures at various levels of linguistic granularity",

    "abstract": "Prompt-based language models like GPT4 and LLaMa have been used for a wide variety of use cases such as simulating agents, searching for information, or for content analysis. For all of these applications and others, political biases in these models can affect their performance. Several researchers have attempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites based on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a particular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in the exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings, and most research relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses. Moreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey instrument. In this work, we contribute a political bias measured informed by political science theory, building on survey design principles to test a wide variety of input prompts, while taking into account prompt sensitivity. We then prompt 11 different open and commercial models, differentiating between instruction-tuned and non-instruction-tuned models, and automatically classify their political stances from 88,110 responses. Leveraging this dataset, we compute political bias profiles across different prompt variations and find that while PCT exaggerates bias in certain models like GPT3.5, measures of political bias are often unstable, but generally more left-leaning for instruction-tuned models.

LongSafety encompasses 7 categories of safety issues and 6 user-oriented long-context tasks, with a total of 1,543 test cases, averaging 5,424 words per context. Our evaluation towards 16 representative LLMs reveals significant safety vulnerabilities, with most models achieving safety rates below 55%. Our findings also indicate that strong safety performance in short-context scenarios does not necessarily correlate with safety in long-context tasks, emphasizing the unique challenges and urgency of improving long-context safety. Moreover, through extensive analysis, we identify challenging safety issues and task types for long-context models. Furthermore, we find that relevant context and extended input sequences can exacerbate safety risks in long-context scenarios, highlighting the critical need for ongoing attention to long-context safety challenges.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks, yet they often struggle with context-faithfulness generations that properly reflect contextual knowledge. While existing approaches focus on enhancing the decoding strategies, they ignore the fundamental mechanism of how contextual information is processed within LLMs' internal states. As a result, LLMs remain limited in their ability to fully leverage contextual knowledge. In this paper, we propose Context-aware Layer Enhancement (CaLE), a novel intervention method that enhances the utilization of contextual knowledge within LLMs' internal representations. By employing 𝒱-usable information analysis, CaLE strategically amplifies the growth of contextual information at an optimal layer, thereby enriching representations in the final layer. Our experiments demonstrate that CaLE effectively improves context-faithful generation in Question-Answering tasks, particularly in scenarios involving unknown or conflicting contextual knowledge",

    "abstract": "The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the \"black box\" of value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety of value-aligned LLMs",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal image-text retrieval is challenging because of the diverse possible associations between content from different modalities. Traditional methods learn a single-vector embedding to represent semantics of each sample, but struggle to capture nuanced and diverse relationships that can exist across modalities. Set-based approaches, which represent each sample with multiple embeddings, offer a promising alternative, as they can capture richer and more diverse relationships. In this paper, we show that, despite their promise, these set-based representations continue to face issues including sparse supervision and set collapse, which limits their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Maximal Pair Assignment Similarity to optimize one-to-one matching between embedding sets which preserve semantic diversity within the set. We also introduce two loss functions to further enhance the representations: Global Discriminative Loss to enhance distinction among embeddings, and Intra-Set Divergence Loss to prevent collapse within each set.

    "abstract": "Academic citations are widely used for evaluating research and tracing knowledge flows. Such uses typically rely on raw citation counts and neglect variability in citation types. In particular, citations can vary in their fidelity as original knowledge from cited studies may be paraphrased, summarized, or reinterpreted, possibly wrongly, leading to variation in how much information changes from cited to citing paper. In this study, we introduce a computational pipeline to quantify citation fidelity at scale. Using full texts of papers, the pipeline identifies citations in citing papers and the corresponding claims in cited papers, and applies supervised models to measure fidelity at the sentence level. Analyzing a large-scale multi-disciplinary dataset of approximately 13 million citation sentence pairs, we find that citation fidelity is higher when authors cite papers that are 1) more recent and intellectually close, 2) more accessible, and 3) the first author has a lower H-index and the author team is medium-sized. Using a quasi-experiment, we establish the \"telephone effect\" - when citing papers have low fidelity to the original claim, future papers that cite the citing paper and the original have lower fidelity to the original. Our work reveals systematic differences in citation fidelity, underscoring the limitations of analyses that rely on citation quantity alone and the potential for distortion of evidence",

Many models approach review generation as a proxy for explainable recommendations.

To address this issue, we propose a personalized, aspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), which integrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate memorizing fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments conducted on two real-world review datasets in the restaurant domain demonstrate that MAPLE significantly outperforms baseline review-generation models.

    "abstract": "A central question in multilingual language modeling is whether large language models (LLMs) develop a universal concept representation, disentangled from specific languages. In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word-translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean representation of a concept across different languages does not affect the models' ability to translate it, but instead improves it. Finally, we generalize to multi-token generation and demonstrate that the model can generate natural language description of those mean representations. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models",

However, while they argue for systematicity of representations, existing benchmarks and models primarily focus on the systematicity of behaviour. We emphasize the crucial nature of this distinction. Furthermore, building on Hadley's (1994) taxonomy of systematic generalization, we analyze the extent to which behavioural systematicity is tested by key benchmarks in the literature across language and vision.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to 256k tokens.

    "abstract": "Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) tasks permeate real-world applications, posing challenges in orchestrating multi-step reasoning across diverse knowledge domains. While existing approaches have been improved with iterative retrieval, they still struggle to identify and organize dynamic knowledge. To address this, we propose DualRAG, a synergistic dual-process framework that seamlessly integrates reasoning and retrieval. DualRAG operates through two tightly coupled processes: Reasoning-augmented Querying (RaQ) and progressive Knowledge Aggregation (pKA). They work in concert: as RaQ navigates the reasoning path and generates targeted queries, pKA ensures that newly acquired knowledge is systematically integrated to support coherent reasoning. This creates a virtuous cycle of knowledge enrichment and reasoning refinement. Through targeted fine-tuning, DualRAG preserves its sophisticated reasoning and retrieval capabilities even in smaller-scale models, demonstrating its versatility and core advantages across different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this dual-process approach substantially improves answer accuracy and coherence, approaching, and in some cases surpassing, the performance achieved with oracle knowledge access.

    "abstract": "Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models (LMs) remains a key challenge, especially for tasks that require complex, multi-step decision-making where existing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches struggle with consistency and verification. In this paper, we propose a novel reasoning framework, referred to as Structure-aware Planning with an Accurate World Model (SWAP), that integrates structured knowledge representation with learned planning. Unlike prior methods that rely purely on natural language reasoning, SWAP leverages entailment graphs to encode structured dependencies and enable symbolic verification of intermediate steps. To systematically construct and update the graph, SWAP employs a policy model to propose candidate expansions and a world model to predict structural updates. To improve accuracy, the world model generates multiple alternative updates, and a discriminator re-ranks them based on plausibility. To encourage diverse exploration, we introduce Diversity-based Modelling (DM), which samples candidates from the remaining probability mass after removing previously sampled candidates from the original policy distribution. Additionally, SWAP improves the discrimination accuracy through Contrastive Ranking (CR), which directly compares candidates within prompts and incorporates meta-knowledge to improve ranking quality. We evaluate SWAP across diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks including math reasoning, logical reasoning, and coding tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWAP significantly improves upon the base models and consistently outperforms existing reasoning methods",

Only recently, a paradigm of first-order algorithms has emerged in the theoretical literature, capable of effectively addressing bilevel optimization problems. Nevertheless, the practical efficiency of this paradigm remains unverified, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces the first scalable instantiation of this paradigm called _ScaleBiO_, focusing on bilevel optimization for large-scale LLM data reweighting. By combining with a recently proposed memory-efficient training technique called LISA, our novel algorithm allows the paradigm to scale to ~30B-sized LLMs on 8×H100 GPUs, marking the first successful application of bilevel optimization under practical scenarios for large-sized LLMs. Empirically, extensive experiments on data reweighting verify the effectiveness of ScaleBiO for different-scaled models, including Llama-3-8B, Gemma-2-9B, Qwen-2-7B, and Qwen-2.5-32B, where bilevel optimization succeeds in instruction-following and math reasoning tasks, outperforming several popular baselines, including uniform sampling, influence-aware data filtering, and reference-model-based sampling methods.

We are specifically interested in how fast vs. slow thinking affects the layer-wise gradients, given the recent popularity of training LLMs on reasoning paths such as chain-of-thoughts (CoT) and process rewards. In our study, fast thinking without CoT leads to larger gradients and larger differences of gradients across layers than slow thinking (Detailed CoT), indicating the learning stability brought by the latter. Additionally, we study whether the gradient patterns can reflect the correctness of responses when training different LLMs using slow vs. fast thinking paths. The results show that the gradients of slow thinking can distinguish correct and irrelevant reasoning paths. As a comparison, we conduct similar gradient analyses on non-reasoning knowledge learning tasks, on which, however, trivially increasing the response length does not lead to similar behaviors of slow thinking.

    "title": "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models under Continued Pre-training for Language Adaptation",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Subjective data, reflecting individual opinions, permeates platforms like Yelp and Amazon, influencing everyday decisions. Upon a user query, collaborative rating platforms return a collection of items ranked in an order that is often not transparent to the users. Then, each item is presented with a collection of reviews in an order that typically is, again, rather opaque. Despite the prevalence of such platforms, little attention has been given to fairness in their context, where groups writing best-ranked reviews for best-ranked items have more influence on users' behavior. We design and evaluate a fairness assessment pipeline that starts with a data collection phase to gather reviews from real-world platforms, by submitting artificial user queries and iterating through rated items. Following that, a group assignment phase computes and infers relevant groups for each review, based on review content and user data. Finally, the third step assesses and evaluates the fairness of rankings for different user groups. The key contributions are comparing group exposure for different queries and platforms and comparing how popular fairness definitions behave in different settings. Experiments on real datasets reveal insights into the impact of item ranking on fairness computation and the varying robustness of these measures",

We introduce RePanda, a structured fact verification approach that translates claims into executable pandas queries, enabling interpretable and verifiable reasoning.To train RePanda, we construct PanTabFact, a structured dataset derived from TabFact, where claims are paired with executable queries generated using DeepSeek-Chat and refined through automated error correction. Fine-tuning DeepSeek-coder-7B-instruct-v1.5 on PanTabFact, RePanda achieves 84.09% accuracy on TabFact. To assess Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, we create a dataset named WikiFact from WikiTableQuestions by transforming question-answer pairs into factual claims. Without additional fine-tuning, RePanda achieves 84.72% accuracy on WikiFact, significantly outperforming all other baselines and demonstrating strong OOD robustness. PanTabFact is publically available on HuggingFace at datasets/AtoosaChegini/PanTabFact.Beyond fact verification, RePanda extends to tabular question answering by generating executable queries that retrieve precise answers. To support this, we introduce PanWiki, a dataset mapping WikiTableQuestions to pandas queries. Fine-tuning on PanWiki, RePanda achieves 75.1% accuracy in direct answer retrieval.

We formalize implied entailment as an extension of the NLI task and introduce the Implied NLI dataset (INLI) to help today's LLMs both recognize a broader variety of implied entailments and to distinguish between implicit and explicit entailment. We show how LLMs fine-tuned on INLI understand implied entailment and can generalize this understanding across datasets and domains",

We conduct a systematic evaluation, both automated and human, of perturbation-based attribution methods for summarization and question answering. The results show that our framework can provide more faithful explanations of generated output than available alternatives, including LLM self-explanations.

Existing Privacy Policy Question Answering (QA) systems exhibit performance disparities across English dialects, disadvantaging speakers of non-standard varieties.

Our approach integrates a Dialect Agent, which translates queries into Standard American English (SAE) while preserving dialectal intent, and a Privacy Policy Agent, which refines predictions using domain expertise. Unlike prior approaches, our method does not require retraining or dialect-specific fine-tuning, making it broadly applicable across models and domains. Evaluated on PrivacyQA and PolicyQA, our framework improves GPT-4o-mini's zero-shot accuracy from 0.394 to 0.601 on PrivacyQA and from 0.352 to 0.464 on PolicyQA, surpassing or matching few-shot baselines without additional training data.

    "title": "Low-Bit Quantization Favors Undertrained LLMs",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Low-bit quantization improves machine learning model efficiency but surprisingly favors undertrained large language models (LLMs). Larger models or those trained on fewer tokens exhibit less quantization-induced degradation (QiD), while smaller, well-trained models face significant performance losses. To gain deeper insights into this trend, we study over 1500+ quantized LLM checkpoints of various sizes and at different training levels (undertrained or fully trained) in a controlled setting, deriving scaling laws for understanding the relationship between QiD and factors: the number of training tokens, model size and bit width.With our derived scaling laws, we propose a novel perspective that we can use QiD to measure an LLM's training levels and determine the number of training tokens required for fully training LLMs of various sizes. Moreover, we use the scaling laws to predict the quantization performance of different-sized LLMs trained with tokens. Our projection shows that the low-bit quantization performance of future models, which are expected to be trained with over \\textcolor{red}{100~trillion} tokens, may NOT be desirable. This poses a potential challenge for low-bit quantization in the future and highlights the need for awareness of a model's training level when evaluating low-bit quantization research.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a text embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on a well-established time series classification benchmark. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging text embedding models to encode time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Table-text retrieval aims to retrieve relevant tables and text to support open-domain question answering. Existing studies use either early or late fusion, but face limitations. Early fusion pre-aligns a table row with its associated passages, forming \"stars,\" which often include irrelevant contexts and miss query-dependent relationships. Late fusion retrieves individual nodes, dynamically aligning them, but it risks missing relevant contexts. Both approaches also struggle with advanced reasoning tasks, such as column-wise aggregation and multi-hop reasoning. To address these issues, we propose HELIOS, which combines the strengths of both approaches. First, the edge-based bipartite subgraph retrieval identifies finer-grained edges between table segments and passages, effectively avoiding the inclusion of irrelevant contexts. Then, the query-relevant node expansion identifies the most promising nodes, dynamically retrieving relevant edges to grow the bipartite subgraph, minimizing the risk of missing important contexts. Lastly, the star-based LLM refinement performs logical inference at the star graph level rather than the bipartite subgraph, supporting advanced reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that HELIOS outperforms state-of-the-art models with a significant improvement up to 42.6% and 39.9% in recall and nDCG, respectively, on the OTT-QA benchmark",

ONEBench enables custom benchmarks for specific capabilities while reusing and aggregating samples, mitigating overfitting and dataset bias for broader capability assessment. It reframes model evaluation as selecting and aggregating sample-level tests.Transitioning from task-specific benchmarks to ONEBench introduces two challenges: heterogeneity (aggregating diverse metrics) and incompleteness(comparing models tested on different data subsets). To address these, we propose an aggregation algorithm that ensures identifiability (asymptotically recovering ground-truth scores) and rapid convergence, enabling accurate model comparisons with relatively little data. On homogenous datasets, our algorithm produces rankings that highly correlate with average scores. Moreover, it remains robust to over 95% missing measurements, reducing evaluation costs by up to 20x with minimal impact on rankings.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the underlying Transformer architecture has inherent limitations in handling complex reasoning tasks. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a practical workaround, but most CoT-based methods rely on a single generic prompt like \"think step by step,\" with no task-specific adaptation. These approaches expect the model to discover an effective reasoning path on its own, forcing it to search through a vast prompt space. In contrast, many work has explored task-specific prompt designs to boost performance. However, these designs are typically developed through trial and error, lacking a theoretical ground. As a result, prompt engineering remains largely ad hoc and unguided.In this paper, we provide a theoretical framework that explains why some prompts succeed while others fail. We show that prompts function as selectors, extracting specific task-relevant information from the model's full hidden state during CoT reasoning. Each prompt defines a unique trajectory through the answer space, and the choice of this trajectory is crucial for task performance and future navigation in the answer space.We analyze the complexity of finding optimal prompts and the size of the prompt space for a given task. Our theory reveals principles behind effective prompt design and shows that naive CoT—using model-self-guided prompt like \"think step by step\" —can severely hinder performance. Showing that optimal prompt search can lead to over a 50% improvement on reasoning tasks through experiments, our work provide a theoretical foundation for prompt engineering",

In this work, we systematically analyze the energy implications of common inference efficiency optimizations across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, including conversational AI and code generation. We introduce a modeling approach that approximates real-world LLM workflows through a binning strategy for input-output token distributions and batch size variations. Our empirical analysis spans software frameworks, decoding strategies, GPU architectures, online and offline serving settings, and model parallelism configurations. We show that the effectiveness of inference optimizations is *highly sensitive to workload geometry, software stack, and hardware accelerators*, demonstrating that naive energy estimates based on FLOPs or theoretical GPU utilization significantly underestimate real-world energy consumption.Our findings reveal that the proper application of relevant inference efficiency optimizations can reduce total energy use by up to **73%** from unoptimized baselines. These insights provide a foundation for sustainable LLM deployment and inform energy-efficient design strategies for future AI infrastructure",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to optimize language model pre-training data mixtures through efficient approximation of the cross-entropy loss corresponding to each candidate mixture via a Mixture of Data Experts (MDE). We use this approximation as a source of additional features in a regression model, trained from observations of model loss for a small number of mixtures. Experiments with Transformer decoder-only language models in the range of 70M to 10B parameters on the SlimPajama dataset show that our method achieves significantly better performance than approaches that train regression models using only the mixture rates as input features. Combining this improved optimization method with an objective that takes into account cross-entropy on end task data leads to superior performance on few-shot downstream evaluations. We also provide theoretical insights on why aggregation of data expert predictions can provide good approximations to model losses for data mixtures",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have spurred growing interest in automatic theorem proving using Lean4, where effective tree search methods are crucial for navigating the underlying large proof search spaces. While the existing approaches primarily rely on value functions and/or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the potential of simpler methods like Best-First Tree Search (BFS) remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether BFS can achieve competitive performance in large-scale theorem proving tasks. We present BFS-Prover, a scalable expert iteration framework, featuring three key innovations. First, we implement strategic data filtering at each expert iteration round, excluding problems solvable via beam search node expansion to focus on harder cases. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of BFS through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) applied to state-tactic pairs automatically annotated with compiler error feedback, refining the LLM's policy to prioritize productive expansions. Third, we employ length normalization in BFS to encourage exploration of deeper proof paths. BFS-Prover achieves a state-of-the-art score of 72.95 on the MiniF2F test set and therefore challenges the perceived necessity of complex tree search methods, demonstrating that BFS can achieve competitive performance when properly scaled",

However, their performance may be limited in complex, multi-turn interactions involving users and multiple tools. To address this, we propose Magnet, a principled framework for synthesizing high-quality training trajectories to enhance the function calling capability of large language model agents in multi-turn conversations with humans. The framework is based on automatic and iterative translations from a function signature path to a sequence of queries and executable function calls. We model the complicated function interactions in multi-turn cases with graph and design novel node operations to build reliable signature paths. Motivated by context distillation, when guiding the generation of positive and negative trajectories using a teacher model, we provide reference function call sequences as positive hints in context and contrastive, incorrect function calls as negative hints. Experiments show that training with the positive trajectories with supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization against negative trajectories, our 14B model, Magnet-14B-mDPO, obtains 68.01 on BFCL-v3 and 73.30 on ToolQuery, surpassing the performance of the teacher model Gemini-1.5-pro-002 by a large margin in function calling",

We propose Squeezed Attention to accelerate LLM applications where a large portion of the input context is fixed.We first leverage K-means clustering offline to group the keys for the fixed context based on semantic similarity and represent each cluster with a single centroid value.During inference, we compare query tokens from the user input with the centroids to predict which keys from the fixed context are semantically relevant, and then compute exact attention using only the important keys, thereby reducing bandwidth and computational costs. We also present a hierarchical version of our algorithm which can reduce the complexity of attention from linear to logarithmic with respect to the fixed context length.We evaluate our method on various long-context benchmarks including LongBench, where it achieves a 3.1× reduction in KV budget with no noticeable accuracy loss and up to an 8× reduction with only a 0.5 point accuracy gap for the LLaMA-2-7B-32K, LWM-Text-Chat-1M, and Longchat-7B-v1.5-32K models.Futhermore, we implement kernels for centroid comparison and sparse FlashAttention with important keys, achieving more than 4× speedups during both the prefill and generation phases for long-context inference.Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/SqueezedAttention",

To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale.

    "abstract": "Foundation models and their checkpoints have significantly advanced deep learning, boosting performance across various applications. However, fine-tuned models often struggle outside their specific domains and exhibit considerable redundancy. Recent studies suggest that combining a pruned fine-tuned model with the original pre-trained model can mitigate forgetting, reduce interference when merging model parameters across tasks, and improve compression efficiency. In this context, developing an effective pruning strategy for fine-tuned models is crucial. Leveraging the advantages of the task vector mechanism, we preprocess fine-tuned models by calculating the differences between them and the original model. Recognizing that different task vector subspaces contribute variably to model performance, we introduce a novel method called **N**eural **P**arameter **S**earch (**NPS**) for slimming down fine-tuned models. This method enhances pruning efficiency by searching through neural parameters of task vectors within low-rank subspaces. Our method has three key applications: enhancing knowledge transfer through pairwise model interpolation, facilitating effective knowledge fusion via model merging, and enabling the deployment of compressed models that retain near-original performance while significantly reducing storage costs. Extensive experiments across vision, NLP, and multi-modal benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, resulting in substantial performance gains",

In this paper, we propose Merge Hijacking, the first backdoor attack targeting model merging in LLMs. The attacker constructs a malicious upload model and releases it. Once a victim user merges it with any other models, the resulting merged model inherits the backdoor while maintaining utility across tasks. Merge Hijacking defines two main objectives—effectiveness and utility—and achieves them through four steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack across different models, merging algorithms, and tasks. Additionally, we show that the attack remains effective even when merging real-world models. Moreover, our attack demonstrates robustness against two inference-time defenses (Paraphrasing and CLEANGEN) and one training-time defense (Fine-pruning)",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive few-shot generalization on many tasks via in-context learning (ICL). Despite their success in showing such emergent abilities, the scale and complexity of larger models also lead to unprecedentedly high computational demands and deployment challenges. In reaction, researchers explore transferring the powerful capabilities of larger models to more efficient and compact models by typically aligning the output of smaller (student) models with that of larger (teacher) models. Existing methods either train student models on the generated outputs of teacher models or imitate their token-level probability distributions. However, these distillation methods pay little to no attention to the input, which also plays a crucial role in ICL. Based on the finding that the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the selection of demonstration examples, we propose Bidirectional Alignment (BiAlign) to fully leverage the models' preferences for ICL examples to improve the ICL abilities of student models. Specifically, we introduce the alignment of input preferences between student and teacher models by incorporating a novel ranking loss, in addition to aligning the token-level output distribution. With extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that BiAlign can consistently outperform existing baselines on a variety of tasks involving language understanding, reasoning, and coding",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents exhibit significant potential across various domains, operating as interactive systems that process environmental observations to generate executable actions for target tasks. The effectiveness of these agents is significantly influenced by their memory mechanism, which records historical experiences as sequences of action-observation pairs. We categorize memory into two types: cross-trial memory, accumulated across multiple attempts, and in-trial memory (working memory), accumulated within a single attempt. While considerable research has optimized performance through cross-trial memory, the enhancement of agent performance through improved working memory utilization remains underexplored. Instead, existing approaches often involve directly inputting entire historical action-observation pairs into LLMs, leading to redundancy in long-horizon tasks. Inspired by human problem-solving strategies, this paper introduces HiAgent, a framework that leverages subgoals as memory chunks to manage the working memory of LLM-based agents hierarchically. Specifically, HiAgent prompts LLMs to formulate subgoals before generating executable actions and enables LLMs to decide proactively to replace previous subgoals with summarized observations, retaining only the action-observation pairs relevant to the current subgoal. Experimental results across five long-horizon tasks demonstrate that HiAgent achieves a twofold increase in success rate and reduces the average number of steps required by 3.8. Additionally, our analysis shows that HiAgent consistently improves performance across various steps, highlighting its robustness and generalizability.

Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts.

Students are asked to analyze literary and cultural texts through a process known as close reading, where they gather textual details from which to formulate evidence-based arguments. Despite being viewed as a basis for critical thinking and widely adopted as a required element of university coursework, close reading has never been evaluated on large language models (LLMs), and multi-discipline benchmarks like MMLU do not include literature as a subject. To fill this gap, we present KRISTEVA, the first close reading benchmark for evaluating interpretive reasoning, consisting of 1331 multiple-choice questions adapted from classroom data. With KRISTEVA, we propose three progressively more difficult sets of tasks to approximate different elements of the close reading process, which we use to test how well LLMs understand and reason about literary works: 1) extracting stylistic features, 2) retrieving relevant contextual information from parametric knowledge, and 3) multi-hop reasoning between style and external contexts.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Continual pretraining enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to specialized domains like medicine and law. However, we observe a consistent phenomenon across different model sizes and domains: a temporary performance drop at the start of the continual pretraining process, followed by a performance recovery phase. To gain a deeper understanding of this issue, we use the stability gap— a concept adapted from the visual domain—which explains this initial drop arises from instability in the model's general abilities. We validate this hypothesis through a series of experiments. To address this initial instability and enhance LLM performance within a fixed compute budget, we propose a training strategy that mitigates instability by increasing the number of epochs, alongside two data sampling strategies targeting data domain relevance and corpus distribution. We conduct experiments on Llama-family models to validate the effectiveness of our strategies for continual pretraining and instruction tuning in medical and legal domains. Our strategies improve the average medical task performance of the OpenLlama-3B model from 36.2% to 40.7% using only 40% of the original training budget, while also enhancing general task performance without causing forgetting. Furthermore, we aPPLy our strategies to continually pre-train and instruction-tune the Llama-3-8B model. The resulting model, Llama-3-Physician, achieves the best medical performance among open-source models on several benchmarks and rivals GPT-4 on specific tasks.

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily life, ensuring their cultural sensitivity and inclusivity is paramount. We introduce PALM, a year-long community-driven project covering all 22 Arab countries. The dataset contains instruction–response pairs in both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and dialectal Arabic (DA), spanning 20 diverse topics. Built by a team of 44 researchers across the Arab world—each an author of this paper—PALM offers a broad, inclusive perspective. We use PALM to evaluate the cultural and dialectal capabilities of several frontier LLMs, revealing notable limitations: while closed-source LLMs generally perform strongly, they still exhibit flaws, and smaller open-source models face greater challenges. Furthermore, certain countries (e.g., Egypt, the UAE) appear better represented than others (e.g., Iraq, Mauritania, Yemen). Our annotation guidelines, code, and data are publicly available for reproducibility. More information about PALM is available on our project page: https://github.com/UBC-NLP/palm",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent text but often struggle with grounding language and strategic dialogue. To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal information extraction across model size and capability. These findings underscore the need for enhancing LLMs' strategic dialogue capabilities",

To bridge this gap, we propose CFBench, a large-scale Chinese Comprehensive Constraints Following Benchmark for LLMs, featuring 1,000 curated samples that cover more than 200 real-life scenarios and over 50 NLP tasks. CFBench meticulously compiles constraints from real-world instructions and constructs an innovative systematic framework for constraint types, which includes 10 primary categories and over 25 subcategories, and ensures each constraint is seamlessly integrated within the instructions. To make certain that the evaluation of LLM outputs aligns with user perceptions, we propose an advanced methodology that integrates multi-dimensional assessment criteria with requirement prioritization, covering various perspectives of constraints, instructions, and requirement fulfillment. Evaluating current leading LLMs on CFBench reveals substantial room for improvement in constraints following, and we further investigate influencing factors and enhancement strategies.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge Reconciliation for MultiModal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.

Traditional self-consistency methods often fail to capture subtle semantic errors in multi-step tasks. We introduce ConsistencyChecker, a tree-based evaluation framework that measures LLMs' ability to preserve semantic consistency during reversible transformation processes, sidestepping benchmark data contamination issues. Our approach constructs self-consistency trees where nodes represent text states after transformations (e.g., translation, code modification, paraphrasing) and edges represent pairs of opposite transformations. By analyzing semantic preservation between nodes at different tree depths, ConsistencyChecker quantifies model reliability without requiring manually annotated reference data. Experiments demonstrate that ConsistencyChecker reliably measures generalization abilities across models from 1.5B to 72B parameters. On translation tasks, GPT-4o Mini achieves the highest L3 consistency score of 98.0%. For code generation, Qwen 2.5 32B leads with 85.1% semantic consistency at L3.

Many tasks such as preference optimization, require the model to produce task-level output consisting of multiple tokens directly by selecting candidates from a pool as predictions. Determining a task-level prediction from candidates using the ordinary token-level decoding mechanism is constrained by time-consuming decoding and interrupted gradients by discrete token selection. Existing works have been using decoding-free candidate selection methods to obtain candidate probability from initial output logits over vocabulary. Though these estimation methods are widely used, they are not systematically evaluated, especially on end tasks. We introduce an evaluation of a comprehensive collection of decoding-free candidate selection approaches on a comprehensive set of tasks, including five multiple-choice QA tasks with a small candidate pool and four clinical decision tasks with a massive amount of candidates, some with 10k+ options.

As individuals have their own, multi-dimensional preferences, recent studies have explored *multi-dimensional personalization*, which aims to enable models to generate responses personalized to *explicit* preferences. However, human preferences are often *implicit* and thus difficult to articulate, limiting the direct application of this approach. To bridge this gap, we propose Active Multi-dimensional Preference Learning (AMPLe), designed to capture implicit user preferences from interactively collected comparative feedback. Building on Bayesian inference, our work introduces a modified posterior update procedure to mitigate estimation bias and potential noise in comparisons. Also, inspired by generalized binary search, we employ an active query selection strategy to minimize the number of required comparisons by a user.

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models (LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, \"LlamaDuo\", for the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments. Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various downstream tasks.

However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, yet their ability to navigate cultural nuances remains underexplored. Misinterpreting cultural content can lead to AI-generated responses that are offensive or inappropriate, limiting their usability in global applications such as customer service, diplomatic communication, and online education. While prior research has evaluated cultural knowledge of LLMs, existing benchmarks fail to assess dynamic cultural competence-the ability to apply cultural knowledge effectively in real-world interactions. To address this gap, we introduce SocialDuolingo, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate cultural competence through multi-turn interactive intercultural scenarios. It comprises 3,060 human-written scenarios spanning 60 countries across six continents. Through extensive experiments on eight prominent LLMs, our findings reveal a significant gap between the cultural knowledge stored in these models and their ability to apply it effectively in cross-cultural communication",

The following three key improvements contribute to SAIL-VL's leading performance: (1) Scalable high-quality visual understanding data construction: We implement a data construction pipeline to enable hundred-million-scale high-quality recaption data annotation. The resulted dataset SAIL-Caption is validated to be of the highest data quality compared with opensource datasets. (2) Scalable Pretraining with High-Quality Visual Understanding Data: We scale SAIL-VL's pretraining budget up to 655B tokens and show that even a 2B VLM benefits from scaled up training data sizes, exhibiting logarithmic data size scaling laws in benchmark performance. (3) Scalable SFT via data quantity and complexity scaling: We curate a high-quality SFT dataset collection with leading data quantity scaling effectiveness and demonstrate that training with progressively higher-complexity data surpasses baseline one-stage training by a large margin. SAIL-VL series models achieve the highest average score in 18 widely used VLM benchmarks in our evaluation, with the 2B model takes the top position over VLMs of comparable sizes on OpenCompass 2024 (https://rank.opencompass.org.cn/leaderboard-multimodal), demonstrating robust visual comprehension abilities.

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM), introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts, delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5.

    "title": "Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (**MHA2MLA**), which includes two key components: for *partial-RoPE*, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for *low-rank approximation*, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.6% to 1%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 1% drop in LongBench performance. Our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JT-Ushio/MHA2MLA",

Unlike existing methods that optimize for a single request or a group of requests as a whole, TETRIS actively selects the most promising draft tokens (for every request in a batch) to be accepted when verified in parallel, resulting in fewer rejected tokens and hence less wasted computing resources. Such an effective resource utilization to achieve fast inference in large language models (LLMs) is especially important to service providers with limited inference capacity. Compared to baseline speculative decoding, TETRIS yields a consistently higher acceptance rate and more effective utilization of the limited inference capacity. We show theoretically and empirically that TETRIS outperforms baseline speculative decoding and existing methods that dynamically select draft tokens, leading to a more efficient batch inference in LLMs",

To address this gap, we introduce the task of set-consistency verification, an extension of natural language inference (NLI) that assesses the logical coherence of entire sets rather than isolated pairs. Building on this task, we present the Set-Consistency Energy Network (SC-Energy), a novel model that employs a margin-based loss to learn the compatibility among a collection of statements. Our approach not only efficiently verifies inconsistencies and pinpoints the specific statements responsible for logical contradictions, but also significantly outperforms existing methods, including prompting-based LLM models.

We use real-world legislative bills matched with potentially affected companies to ground these interactions. Our results show that LLM lobbyists can draft subtle phrasing to avoid such identification by strong LLM-based detectors. Further optimization of the phrasing using LLM-based re-planning and re-sampling increases deception rates by up to 40 percentage points.Our human evaluations to verify the quality of deceptive generations and their retention of self-serving intent show significant coherence with our automated metrics and also help in identifying certain strategies of deceptive phrasing.This study highlights the risk of LLMs' capabilities for strategic phrasing through seemingly neutral language to attain self-serving goals.

Various methods have been proposed to maximize the utility of parallel data to enhance the multilingual capabilities of multilingual encoder-based and encoder-decoder language models. However, some decoder-based LLMs opt to ignore parallel data instead. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the impact of adding parallel data on LLMs' multilingual capabilities, focusing specifically on translation and multilingual common-sense reasoning.

Moreover, existing open-source VLMs lack systematic exploration into extending their context length, and commercial models often provide limited details. To tackle this, we aim to establish an effective solution that enhances long context performance of VLMs while preserving their capacities in short context scenarios. Towards this goal, we make the best design choice through extensive experiment settings from data curation to context window extending and utilizing: (1) we analyze data sources and length distributions to construct ETVLM - a data recipe to balance the performance across scenarios; (2) we examine existing position extending methods, identify their limitations and propose M-RoPE++ as an enhanced approach; we also choose to solely instruction-tune the backbone with mixed-source data; (3) we discuss how to better utilize extended context windows and propose hybrid-resolution training. Built on the Qwen-VL series model, we propose Giraffe, which is effectively extended to 128K lengths. Evaluated on extensive long context VLM benchmarks such as VideoMME and Viusal Haystacks, our Giraffe achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized open-source long VLMs and is competitive with commercial model GPT-4V.

To this end we create ConECT– a new Czech-to-Polish e-commerce product translation dataset coupled with images and product metadata consisting of 11,400 sentence pairs.

However, previous work has demonstrated that blind language models (which do not incorporate perception, but predict an answer based solely on the question text) are a strong baseline for existing benchmarks, even compared against state-of-the-art vision and language models. To determine whether a model is grounding its answers in its specific environment, rather than relying on a language model's expectations about the world generally, we propose PQB-EQA, a *per-question balanced* EQA dataset. In this new benchmark, every question appears twice, paired with two different environments that yield two different answers. That is, the answer distribution is balanced for each question, not just across the whole dataset.

Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0 training data and retains 70–80% of full-data performance across models",

We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge transfers across languages during the language adaptation of LLMs, a process where an LLM is continually pre-trained to learn another language. We introduce an interpretable framework to study this transfer, ensuring training data transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora. We hope our findings could inform future research on knowledge transfer and promote the development of culturally aware models, particularly for low-resource languages",

However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could assign probability to many sequences because they are all valid, and not because it is unsure about how to perform the task. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on model probabilities without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.

KnowShiftQA comprises 3,005 questions across five subjects, designed with a comprehensive question typology focusing on context utilization and knowledge integration. Our extensive experiments on retrieval and question answering performance reveal that most RAG systems suffer a substantial performance drop when faced with these knowledge discrepancies.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains, accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., \"fairly confident\") instead of numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap, we first define ***marker confidence*** as the observed accuracy when a model employs an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation, underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence and actual model uncertainty.

In this work, we investigate an adapter souping method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines. However, we find that linguistic relatedness—or even a lack thereof—does not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer. We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis.

We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead down-weighs misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 and Arena-Hard using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed.

We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Predicting semantic textual similarity (STS) is a complex and ongoing challenge in natural language processing (NLP). Over the years, researchers have developed a variety of supervised and unsupervised approaches to calculate STS automatically. Additionally, various benchmarks, which include STS datasets, have been established to consistently evaluate and compare these STS methods. However, they largely focus on high-resource languages, mixed with datasets annotated focusing on relatedness instead of similarity and containing automatically translated instances. Therefore, no dedicated benchmark for multilingual STS exists. To solve this gap, we introduce the Multilingual Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (MUSTS), which spans 13 languages, including low-resource languages. By evaluating more than 25 models on MUSTS, we establish the most comprehensive benchmark of multilingual STS methods. Our findings confirm that STS remains a challenging task, particularly for low-resource languages",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of text generated by LLMs remains a challenge for question answering, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and many other natural language processing tasks. Evaluating the factuality of LLM generated responses is particularly important in medical question answering, where the stakes are high. One method of evaluating the factuality of text is through the use of information nuggets (answer keys). Nuggets are text representing atomic facts that may be used by an assessor to make a binary decision as to whether the fact represented by said nugget is contained in an answer. Although manual nugget extraction is expensive and time-consuming, recent RAG shared task evaluations have explored automating the nuggetization of text with LLMs. In this work, we explore several approaches to nugget generation for medical question answering and evaluate their alignment with expert human nugget generation. We find providing an example and extracting nuggets from an answer to be the best approach to nuggetization. While, overall, we found the capabilities of LLMs to distill atomic facts limited, Llama 3.3 performed the best out of the models we tested",

This setting, in which the model must generate the missing quotation, mirrors the human process of literary analysis by requiring models to perform both global narrative reasoning and close textual examination. We curate a high-quality subset of 292 examples through extensive filtering and human verification. Our experiments show that recent reasoning models, such as Gemini 2.5 Pro can exceed human expert performance (62.5% vs. 50% accuracy). In contrast, the best open-weight model achieves only 29.1% accuracy, highlighting a wide gap in interpretive reasoning between open and closed-weight models.

Strikingly, replacing up to 90% of the training data only marginally decreases performance, but replacing the final 10% leads to severe declines. We find that models trained on purely synthetic data can be improved by including as few as 125 human-generated data points. We show that matching the performance gain of a little human data requires an order of magnitude more synthetic data, and then estimate price ratios at which human annotation would be a more cost-effective solution.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised cross-domain keyphrase generation is crucial in real-world natural language processing scenarios. However, the accuracy of up-to-date approaches is limited by the distribution shift between source and target domain, which stems from the cross-domain field. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for the cross-domain keyphrase generation tasks due to their strong generalization abilities, facilitated by providing demonstrations relevant to the target task. Nevertheless, it is often difficult to obtain labeled samples from the target domain. To address this challenge, this paper aims to seek rational demonstrations from the source domain, thereby improving the LLMs' ability in the unsupervised cross-domain keyphrase generation setting. Specifically, we design a novel domain-aware retrieval model on the source domain. Guided by insights from domain generalization theory, we introduce two generalization terms, one for cross-domain relevance and another for each domain consistency to better support retrieval of rational demonstrations. By the retrieved source-domain demonstrations and distance-based relevant score, the proposed approach achieves optimal accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on widely used cross-domain KG benchmarks demonstrate our approach's state-of-the-art performance and effectiveness",

We introduce LexKeyPlan, a novel framework that integrates anticipatory planning into generation. Instead of relying solely on context for retrieval, LexKeyPlan generates keyphrases outlining future content serving as forward-looking plan, guiding retrieval for more accurate text generation. This work incorporates planning into legal text generation, demonstrating how keyphrases—representing legal concepts—enhance factual accuracy. By structuring retrieval around legal concepts, LexKeyPlan better aligns with legal reasoning, making it particularly suited for legal applications. Using the ECHR corpus as case study, we show that LexKeyPlan improves factual accuracy and coherence by retrieving information aligned with the intended content",

In this paper, we leverage LLaMA to generate subtexts for argument pairs, and verify the effectiveness of subtext-based IDRR. We construct an IDRR baseline using the decoder-only backbone LLaMA, and enhance it with subtext-aware relation reasoning. A confidence-diagnosed dual-channel network is used for collaboration between in-subtext and out-of-subtext IDRR. We experiment on PDTB-2.0 and PDTB-3.0 for both the main-level and secondary-level relation taxonomies.

To test this, we manually annotated five gesture type labels to 925 gesture instances from the Miraikan SC Corpus and analyzed gesture descriptions generated by state-of-the-art MLLMs, including GPT-4o.

While current methods have advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important, and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory, which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks—ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME—demonstrate that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will be released",

To address these questions, we use language models to annotate a large corpus of Twitter/X community notes with attributes such as topic, cited sources, and whether they refute claims tied to broader misinformation narratives. Our analysis reveals that community notes cite fact-checking sources up to five times more than previously reported. Fact-checking is especially crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives, which are *twice* as likely to reference fact-checking sources compared to other sources.

It includes 16 tasks, identifying the Allen relation between two temporal events and temporal arithmetic. We assess the performance of seven recent LLMs. The results indicate that models handle Allen relations, even symmetrical ones, quite differently. Moreover, the findings suggest that the models may rely on memorization to answer time-related questions. Overall, the models' low performance highlights the need for improved temporal understanding in LLMs. Our dataset and the source code are available at https://github.com/duyguislakoglu/chronosense",

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a common part of our lives, yet few studies have examined how they influence our behavior. Using a cooperative language game in which players aim to converge on a shared word, we investigate how people adapt their communication strategies when paired with either an LLM or another human. Our study demonstrates that LLMs exert a measurable influence on human communication strategies and that humans notice and adapt to these differences irrespective of whether they are aware they are interacting with an LLM. These findings highlight the reciprocal influence of human–AI dialogue and raise important questions about the long-term implications of embedding LLMs in everyday communication",

However, this method suffers from inefficiencies and out-of-distribution errors.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Incorporating automatic speech recognition (ASR) into field linguistics workflows for language documentation has become increasingly common. While ASR performance has seen improvements in low-resource settings, obstacles remain when training models on data collected by documentary linguists. One notable challenge lies in the way that this data is curated. ASR datasets built from spontaneous speech are typically recorded in consistent settings and transcribed by native speakers following a set of well designed guidelines. In contrast, field linguists collect data in whatever format it is delivered by their language consultants and transcribe it as best they can given their language skills and the quality of the recording. This approach to data curation, while valuable for linguistic research, does not always align with the standards required for training robust ASR models. In this paper, we explore methods for identifying speech transcriptions in fieldwork data that may be unsuitable for training ASR models. We focus on two complimentary automated measures of transcription quality that can be used to identify transcripts with characteristics that are common in field data but could be detrimental to ASR training. We show that one of the metrics is highly effective at retrieving these types of transcriptions. Additionally, we find that filtering datasets using this metric of transcription quality reduces WER both in controlled experiments using simulated fieldwork with artificially corrupted data and in real fieldwork corpora",

    "abstract": "Scaling the test-time compute of large language models has demonstrated impressive performance on reasoning benchmarks. However, existing evaluations of test-time scaling make the strong assumption that a reasoning system should always give an answer to any question provided. This overlooks concerns about whether a model is confident in its answer, and whether it is appropriate to always provide a response. To address these concerns, we extract confidence scores during reasoning for thresholding model responses. We find that increasing compute budget at inference time not only helps models answer more questions correctly, but also increases confidence in correct responses. We then extend the current paradigm of zero-risk responses during evaluation by considering settings with non-zero levels of response risk, and suggest a recipe for reporting evaluations under these settings",

    "abstract": "Mental manipulation is a subtle yet pervasive form of abuse in interpersonal communication, making its detection critical for safeguarding potential victims. However, due to manipulation's nuanced and context-specific nature, identifying manipulative language in complex, multi-turn, and multi-person conversations remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs). To address this gap, we introduce the MultiManip dataset, comprising 220 multi-turn, multi-person dialogues balanced between manipulative and non-manipulative interactions, all drawn from reality shows that mimic real-world scenarios. For manipulative interactions, it includes 11 distinct manipulations depicting real-life scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B, employing various prompting strategies. Despite their capabilities, these models often struggle to detect manipulation effectively. To overcome this limitation, we propose SELF-PERCEPT, a novel, two-stage prompting framework inspired by Self-Perception Theory, demonstrating strong performance in detecting multi-person, multi-turn mental manipulation.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with zero-shot generalization, and several modular approaches have been proposed to address this challenge. Yet, we hypothesize that a key limitation remains: the entanglement of general knowledge and task-specific adaptations. To overcome this, we propose a modular framework that disentangles these components by constructing a library of task-specific LoRA modules alongside a general-domain LoRA. By subtracting this general knowledge component from each task-specific module, we obtain residual modules that focus more exclusively on task-relevant information. We call this approach general knowledge subtraction or GenKnowSub. Leveraging the refined task-specific modules and the Arrow routing algorithm, we dynamically select and combine modules for new inputs without additional training. Our studies on the Phi-3 model and standard Arrow as baselines reveal that using general knowledge LoRAs derived from diverse languages, including English, French, and German, yields consistent performance gains in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings across a wide set of benchmarks. Further experiments on Phi-2 reveal how GenKnowSub generalizes to a weaker LLM",

We examine this question in the context of binomial ordering preferences involving two conjoined nouns in English. When choosing a binomial ordering (radio and television vs television and radio), humans rely on more than simply the observed frequency of each option. Humans also rely on abstract ordering preferences (e.g., preferences for short words before long words). We investigate whether large language models simply rely on the observed preference in their training data, or whether they are capable of learning the abstract ordering preferences (i.e., abstract representations) that humans rely on. Our results suggest that both smaller and larger models' ordering preferences are driven exclusively by their experience with that item in the training data.

However, most prior methods rely on paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for unvoiced EMG-to-text conversion, which is not practical for these individuals. Given the rise of large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that maps EMG features to an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error rate of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown to be extendable to new language modalities—such as audio—understanding articulatory biosignals, like unvoiced EMG, is more challenging.

Notably, despite the attenuation, gold tokens still occupy high-ranking positions in the decoding space. Motivated by it, we propose the training-free Positional Contrastive Decoding (PCD) that contrasts the logits derived from long-aware attention with those from designed local-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on the gains introduced by large-scale short-to-long training. Through the analysis of long-term decay simulation, we demonstrate that PCD effectively alleviates attention score degradation.

Based on this insight, we introduce Sparse-to-Dense (StD), a novel decoding strategy that integrates two distinct modules: one leveraging sparse top-K attention and the other employing dense full attention. These modules collaborate to accelerate Video-LLMs without loss. The fast (sparse) model speculatively decodes multiple tokens, while the slow (dense) model verifies them in parallel. StD is a tuning-free, plug-and-play solution that achieves up to a 1.94 walltime speedup in video processing.

First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets × 4 models × 8 UQ methods. Our analysis showsthat length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods.

Further, under this SeqKD setting, we also characterize how students behave on specific training data subgroups, such as subgroups with low quality or specific counterfactual memorization (CM) scores, and find that students exhibit greater denoising on low-quality subgroups. Finally, we propose a modification to SeqKD named Adaptive-SeqKD, which intervenes in SeqKD to reduce memorization and hallucinations.

    "abstract": "Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a \"precomputation step\", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT (CITATION) originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes",

Here, we demonstrate what can be inferred about meaning change and variation using more advanced NLP methods, focusing on terms in the U.S. Constitution.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "When completing knowledge-intensive tasks, humans sometimes need an answer and a corresponding reference passage for auxiliary reading. Previous methods required obtaining pre-segmented article chunks through additional retrieval models. This paper explores leveraging the parameterized knowledge stored during the pre-training phase of large language models (LLMs) to recall reference passage from any starting position independently. We propose a two-stage framework that simulates the scenario of humans recalling easily forgotten references. Initially, the LLM is prompted to recall document title identifiers to obtain a coarse-grained document set. Then, based on the acquired coarse-grained document set, it recalls fine-grained passage. In the two-stage recall process, we use constrained decoding to ensure that content outside of the stored documents is not generated. To increase speed, we only recall a short prefix in the second stage, and then locate its position to retrieve a complete passage. Experiments on KILT knowledge-sensitive tasks have verified that LLMs can independently recall reference passage locations in various task forms, and the obtained reference significantly assists downstream tasks",

We evaluate several multilingual models, including both smaller fine-tuned models and large language models in a zero-shot setting.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks without domain-specific training, fueling interest in their potential for time-series forecasting. While LLMs have shown potential in zero-shot forecasting through prompting alone, recent studies suggest that LLMs lack inherent effectiveness in forecasting. Given these conflicting findings, a rigorous validation is essential for drawing reliable conclusions. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs as zero-shot forecasters compared to state-of-the-art domain-specific models. Our experiments show that LLM-based zero-shot forecasters often struggle to achieve high accuracy due to their sensitivity to noise, underperforming even simple domain-specific models. We have explored solutions to reduce LLMs' sensitivity to noise in the zero-shot setting, but improving their robustness remains a significant challenge. Our findings suggest that rather than emphasizing zero-shot forecasting, a more promising direction would be to focus on fine-tuning LLMs to better process numerical sequences.

These evaluation metrics are acceptable for determining the extent to which language models can understand and reason about text in a general sense, but fail to capture nuanced capabilities, such as the ability of language models to recognize and obey rare grammar points, particularly in languages other than English. We measure the perplexity of language models when confronted with the \"first person psych predicate restriction\" grammar point in Japanese. Weblab is the only tested open source model in the 7-10B parameter range which consistently assigns higher perplexity to ungrammatical psych predicate sentences than grammatical ones. We give evidence that Weblab's uniformly bad tokenization is a possible root cause for its good performance, and show that Llama 3's perplexity on grammatical psych predicate sentences can be reduced by orders of magnitude (28x difference) by restricting test sentences to those with uniformly well-behaved tokenizations. We show in further experiments on machine translation tasks that language models will use alternative grammar patterns in order to produce grammatical sentences when tokenization issues prevent the most natural sentence from being output",

    "abstract": "Understanding the expressive power of transformers has recently attracted attention, as it offers insights into their abilities and limitations. Many studies analyze unique hard attention transformers, where attention selects a single position that maximizes the attention scores. When multiple positions achieve the maximum score, either the rightmost or the leftmost of those is chosen. In this paper, we highlight the importance of this seeming triviality. Recently, finite-precision transformers with both leftmost- and rightmost-hard attention were shown to be equivalent to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). We show that this no longer holds with only leftmost-hard attention—in that case, they correspond to a strictly weaker fragment of LTL. Furthermore, we show that models with leftmost-hard attention are equivalent to soft attention, suggesting they may better approximate real-world transformers than right-attention models. These findings refine the landscape of transformer expressivity and underscore the role of attention directionality",

In forensic settings simply being considered as one of the potential authors of an evidential piece of text or communication can result in undesirable scrutiny. This raises a fairness question: Is every author in the candidate pool at equal risk of misattribution? Standard evaluation measures for authorship attribution systems do not explicitly account for this notion of fairness. We introduce a simple measure, Misattribution Unfairness Index (MAUIk), which is based on how often authors are ranked in the top k for texts they did not write. Using this measure we quantify the unfairness of five models on two different datasets. All models exhibit high levels of unfairness with increased risks for some authors. Furthermore, we find that this unfairness relates to how the models embed the authors as vectors in the latent search space. In particular, we observe that the risk of misattribution is higher for authors closer to the centroid (or center) of the embedded authors in the haystack. These results indicate the potential for harm and the need for communicating with and calibrating end users on misattribution risk when building and providing such models for downstream use",

To ensure high accuracy and reliability, we manually validated and refined 5,000 GUI coordinate-instruction pairs, creating WinSpot—the first benchmark specifically designed for GUI grounding tasks in Windows environments. WinSpot provides a high-quality dataset for training and evaluating visual GUI agents, establishing a foundation for future research in GUI automation across diverse and unstructured desktop environments",

For example, a summarization system that tends to overrepresent negative reviews of products can mislead customers into disregarding good products. Previous works measure fairness in MDS at two levels: summary-level and corpus-level. While summary-level fairness focuses on individual summaries, corpus-level fairness focuses on a corpus of summaries. Recent methods primarily focus on summary-level fairness. We propose FairPO, a preference tuning method that focuses on both summary-level and corpus-level fairness in MDS. To improve summary-level fairness, we propose to generate preference pairs by perturbing document sets. To improve corpus-level fairness, we propose fairness-aware preference tuning by dynamically adjusting the weights of preference pairs.

In this study, we propose an aggregation method for existing automatic evaluation metrics which aligns with human evaluation methods to bridge this gap. We conducted experiments using various metrics, including edit-based metrics, -gram based metrics, and sentence-level metrics, and show that resolving the gap improves results for the most of metrics on the SEEDA benchmark.We also found that even BERT-based metrics sometimes outperform the metrics of GPT-4",

Existing approaches for detecting hallucination in long-form tasks either focus on limited domains or rely heavily on external fact-checking tools, which may not always be available.In this work, we systematically investigate reference-free hallucination detection in open-domain long-form responses. Our findings reveal that internal states (e.g., model's output probability and entropy) alone are insufficient for reliably (i.e., better than random guessing) distinguishing between factual and hallucinated content. To enhance detection, we explore various existing approaches, including prompting-based methods, probing, and fine-tuning, with fine-tuning proving the most effective. To further improve the accuracy, we introduce a new paradigm, named RATE-FT, that augments fine-tuning with an auxiliary task for the model to jointly learn with the main task of hallucination detection. With extensive experiments and analysis using a variety of model families & datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, e.g., +3% over general fine-tuning methods on LongFact",

    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) achieve efficient sub-quadratic compute complexity but often exhibit significant performance drops as context length increases. Recent work attributes this deterioration to an exponential decay in hidden-state memory. While token filtering has emerged as a promising remedy, its underlying rationale and limitations remain largely non-understood. In this paper, we first investigate the attention patterns of Mamba to shed light on why token filtering alleviates long-context degradation. Motivated by these findings, we propose LAMB, a training-free, attention-guided token filtering strategy designed to preserve critical tokens during inference. LAMB can boost long-context performance for both pure SSMs and hybrid models, achieving up to an average improvement of 30.35% over state-of-the-art techniques on standard long-context understanding benchmarks. Our analysis and experiments reveal new insights into the interplay between attention, token selection, and memory retention, and are thus expected to inspire broader applications of token filtering in long-sequence modeling",

While extensive research has investigated biases in LLMs, prior work has predominantly focused on explicit bias, with minimal attention to implicit bias and the relation between these two forms of bias. This paper presents a systematic framework grounded in social psychology theories to investigate and compare explicit and implicit biases in LLMs.We propose a novel self-reflection-based evaluation framework that operates in two phases: first measuring implicit bias through simulated psychological assessment methods, then evaluating explicit bias by prompting LLMs to analyze their own generated content. Through extensive experiments on advanced LLMs across multiple social dimensions, we demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a substantial inconsistency between explicit and implicit biases: while explicit bias manifests as mild stereotypes, implicit bias exhibits strong stereotypes.We further investigate the underlying factors contributing to this explicit-implicit bias inconsistency, examining the effects of training data scale, model size, and alignment techniques. Experimental results indicate that while explicit bias declines with increased training data and model size, implicit bias exhibits a contrasting upward trend.

Therefore, we propose a novel metric, MSEval, which considers the correctness of intermediate steps in addition to the final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MultiStAR using 17 representative close-source and open-source MLLMs. The results reveal that while existing MLLMs perform adequately on basic perception tasks, they continue to face challenges in more complex rule detection stages.

It aims to generate responses consistent with the dialogue history and personality information across multiple sessions to engage users' interest in the dialogue. Recent approaches focusing on history modeling and persona modeling have advanced the development of this field. However, they overlook the importance of dialogue structure in helping large language models (LLMs) understand the dialogue context. Moreover, these methods do not efficiently expand and utilize personality information, reducing the responses' consistency. In this paper, we propose a Persona-Aware LLM-enAnCEd(PALACE) framework for multi-session personalized dialogue generation. Specifically, the framework consists of three components: a topic-aware memory bank, a persona prompt learning module, and VAE-LoRA. The topic-aware memory bank works by retrieving historical information that possesses a certain dialogue structure and relevant topics. The persona prompt learning module enhances the LLM's persona-aware capabilities by utilizing a persona commonsense knowledge graph and a query-driven graph neural network. Furthermore, to enhance the generative capabilities of the LLM and obtain more useful prior knowledge, we combine VAE with LoRA to propose VAE-LoRA.

Conventional compression methods often result in substantial performance degradation within LLMs and struggle to restore model quality during fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we present Bayesian Knowledge Distillation (BayesKD), a novel distillation framework meticulously designed for compact LLMs in resource-constrained fine-tuning scenarios. Departing from conventional LLM distillation methods that introduce time-consuming paradigms and fail to generalize in compressed LLM fine-tuning scenarios, our BayesKD develops the Logits Dual-Scaling, Knowledge Alignment Module, and Bayesian Distillation Optimization. In particular, our Logits Dual-Scaling strategy adaptively aligns the strength of the teacher's knowledge transfer, while the Knowledge Alignment Module bridges the gap between the teacher and student models by projecting their knowledge representations into a shared interval. Additionally, we employ Logits-Aware Bayesian Optimization to swiftly identify optimal settings based on these strategies, thereby enhancing model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that BayesKD consistently outperforms baseline methods on various state-of-the-art LLMs, including LLaMA, Qwen2, Bloom, and Vicuna. Notably, our BayesKD achieves average accuracy gains of 2.99% and 4.05% over standard KD for the 8B parameter LLaMA and Qwen2 model. Codes are available in the supplementary materials",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs), necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly, computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLMs-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval routes—one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse retrieval",

    "abstract": "Most datasets for sentiment analysis lack context in which an opinion was expressed, often crucial for emotion understanding, and are mainly limited by a few emotion categories. Foundation large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 suffer from over-predicting emotions and are too resource-intensive. We design an LLM-based data synthesis pipeline and leverage a large model, Mistral-7b, for the generation of training examples for more accessible, lightweight BERT-type encoder models. We focus on enlarging the semantic diversity of examples and propose grounding the generation into a corpus of narratives to produce non-repetitive story-character-centered utterances with unique contexts over 28 emotion classes. By running 700K inferences in 450 GPU hours, we contribute with the dataset of 100K contextual and also 300K context-less examples to cover both scenarios. We use it for fine-tuning pre-trained encoders, which results in several Emo Pillars models. We show that Emo Pillars models are highly adaptive to new domains when tuned to specific tasks such as GoEmotions, ISEAR, IEMOCAP, and EmoContext, reaching the SOTA performance on the first three. We also validate our dataset, conducting statistical analysis and human evaluation, and confirm the success of our measures in utterance diversification (although less for the neutral class) and context personalization, while pointing out the need for improved handling of out-of-taxonomy labels within the pipeline",

    "title": "Multi-Prompting Decoder Helps Better Language Understanding",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Recent large Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) usually only provide users with the inference APIs, namely the emerging Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) setting. To adapt MaaS PLMs to downstream tasks without accessing their parameters and gradients, some existing methods focus on the output-side adaptation of PLMs, viewing the PLM as an encoder and then optimizing a task-specific decoder for decoding the output hidden states and class scores of the PLM. Despite the effectiveness of these methods, they only use a single prompt to query PLMs for decoding, leading to a heavy reliance on the quality of the adopted prompt. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-Prompting Decoder (MPD) framework for MaaS adaptation. The core idea is to query PLMs with multiple different prompts for each sample, thereby obtaining multiple output hidden states and class scores from PLMs for subsequent decoding. Such multi-prompting decoding paradigm can simultaneously mitigate reliance on the quality of a single prompt, alleviate the issue of data scarcity under the few-shot setting, and provide richer knowledge extracted from PLMs. Specifically, we propose two decoding strategies: multi-prompting decoding with optimal transport for hidden states and calibrated decoding for class scores. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language understanding datasets under the few-shot setting",

    "abstract": "Turn-taking is richly multimodal. Predictive turn-taking models (PTTMs) facilitate natural- istic human-robot interaction, yet most rely solely on speech. We introduce MM-VAP, a multimodal PTTM which combines speech with visual cues including facial expression, head pose and gaze. We find that it outperforms the state-of-the-art audio-only in videoconfer- encing interactions (84% vs. 79% hold/shift prediction accuracy). Unlike prior work which aggregates all holds and shifts, we group by duration of silence between turns. This reveals that through the inclusion of visual features, MM-VAP outperforms a state-of-the-art audio- only turn-taking model across all durations of speaker transitions. We conduct a detailed abla- tion study, which reveals that facial expression features contribute the most to model perfor- mance. Thus, our working hypothesis is that when interlocutors can see one another, visual cues are vital for turn-taking and must therefore be included for accurate turn-taking prediction. We additionally validate the suitability of au- tomatic speech alignment for PTTM training using telephone speech. This work represents the first comprehensive analysis of multimodal PTTMs. We discuss implications for future work and make all code publicly available",

Existing work has largely been confined to the task level, without considering that tasks are artificially defined and, to LLMs, merely consist of tokens and representations. To bridge this gap, we investigate zero-shot generalization from the perspective of the data itself. We first demonstrate that zero-shot generalization happens very early during instruction tuning, with loss serving as a stable indicator. Next, we investigate training data arrangement through similarity and granularity perspectives, confirming that the timing of exposure to certain training examples may greatly facilitate generalization on unseen tasks. Finally, we propose a more grounded training data arrangement framework, Test-centric Multi-turn Arrangement, and show its effectiveness in promoting continual learning and further loss reduction. For the first time, we show that zero-shot generalization during instruction tuning is a form of similarity-based generalization between training and test data at the instance level",

Finally, MFinMeeting includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer (QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of understanding.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Data Augmentation (DA) has emerged as a promising solution to address the scarcity of high-quality annotated data in low-resource relation extraction (LRE). Leveraging large language models (LLMs), DA has significantly improved the performance of RE models with considerably fewer parameters. However, existing DA methods struggle with diversity misalignments, as they neglect the diversity required by the model and generate homogeneous augmentations that do not cover the inter-sample and inter-relation variability, leading to suboptimal performance. Inspired by the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) framework, which provides a robust theoretical foundation for iterative decision-making under dynamic conditions, we propose an OODA-driven Diverse DA method (ODDA), guiding the data generation and selection process. DDA first observes the RE model's behavior to select effective demonstrations for LLMs. Next, it orients LLMs towards generating diverse data by replacing schema constraints with attribute constraints. Then ODDA decides on the final augmented dataset with overall diversity from a global search and finally acts to train the RE model. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that ODDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average F1 improvements of 3.1% across various LRE scenarios while maintaining enhanced model stability",

In light of the detected summarization issues, we propose different cost-effective mitigation strategies, based on Chain-of-Thought prompting, that involve the injection of knowledge extracted by external, lightweight models. To perform the VLLM evaluation, we design a new video summarization benchmark consisting of 100 videos with varying characteristics in terms of domain, duration, and spatio-temporal properties. Videos are manually annotated by three independent human experts with plain text, event-based, and spatio-temporal summaries.

However, these approaches suffer from either high computational complexity or coarse-grained representations. Additionally, a common problem shared by the previous works is their reliance on decoder-only Transformers, limiting their ability to incorporate contextual information after the target span. To address the above problems, we propose two techniques applicable to all model-internals-based methods. First, we aggregate token-wise evidence through set union operations, preserving the granularity of representations. Second, we enhance the attributor by integrating dependency parsing to enrich the semantic completeness of target spans. For practical implementation, our approach employs attention weights as the similarity metric. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms all prior works",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Safety, security, and compliance are essential requirements when aligning large language models (LLMs). However, many seemingly aligned LLMs are soon shown to be susceptible to jailbreak attacks. These attacks aim to circumvent the models' safety guardrails and security mechanisms by introducing jailbreak prompts into malicious queries. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces **Defensive Prompt Patch** (DPP), a novel prompt-based defense mechanism specifically designed to protect LLMs against such sophisticated jailbreak strategies. Unlike previous approaches, which have often compromised the utility of the model for the sake of safety, DPP is designed to achieve a minimal Attack Success Rate (ASR) while preserving the high utility of LLMs. Our method uses strategically designed suffix prompts that effectively thwart a wide range of standard and adaptive jailbreak techniques. Empirical results conducted on Llama-2-7B-Chat and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of DPP, showing significant reductions in ASR with negligible impact on utility. Our approach not only outperforms existing defense strategies in balancing safety and functionality, but also provides a scalable and robust solution to various LLM platforms",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Determining and ranking the most salient entities in a text is critical for user-facing systems, especially as users increasingly rely on models to interpret long documents they only partially read. Graded entity salience addresses this need by assigning entities scores that reflect their relative importance in a text. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: subjective judgments of salience, which allow for gradient scoring but lack consistency, and summarization-based methods, which define salience as mention-worthiness in a summary, promoting explainability but limiting outputs to binary labels (entities are either summary-worthy or not). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for graded entity salience that combines the strengths of both approaches. Using an English dataset spanning 12 spoken and written genres, we collect 5 summaries per document and calculate each entity's salience score based on its presence across these summaries. Our approach shows stronger correlation with scores based on human summaries and alignments, and outperforms existing techniques, including LLMs. We release our data and code at https://github.com/jl908069/gum_sum_salience to support further research on graded salient entity extraction",

We propose a new dataset of logical reasoningchains, in which the individual deduction steps have been manually annotated for soundness, and benchmark several methods on it.

    "abstract": "Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian, Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset, comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate, reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source. This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages, contributing to more equitable and accurate translation systems",

However, surveys often include numerous features that lead to high-dimensional inputs for machine learning models. This paper exploits a unique source of information in surveys for feature selection. We observe that feature names (i.e., survey questions) are often semantically indicative of what features are most useful. Using language models, we leverage semantic textual similarity (STS) scores between features and targets to select features. The performance of STS scores in directly ranking features as well as in the minimal-redundancy-maximal-relevance (mRMR) algorithm is evaluated using survey data collected as part of a clinical study on persistent post-surgical pain (PPSP) as well as an accessible dataset collected through the NIH All of Us program.

To bridge this gap, we present LongPiBench, a benchmark designed to assess positional bias involving multiple pieces of relevant information. It includes various tasks and input lengths. Thorough experiments are conducted with three commercial and six open-source models.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "We present a simple meta quantization approach that quantizes different layers of a large language model (LLM) at different bit levels, and is independent of the underlying quantization technique. Specifically, we quantize the most important layers to higher bit precision and less important layers to lower bits. We propose two effective strategies to measure the importance of layers within LLMs: the first measures the importance of a layer based on how different its output embeddings are from the input embeddings (higher is better); the second estimates the importance of a layer using the number of layer weights that are much larger than average (smaller is better). We show that quantizing different layers at varying bits as per our importance scores results in minimal performance drop with a far more compressed model. Finally, we present several practical key takeaways from our variable layer-wise quantization experiments: (a) LLM performance under variable quantization remains close to the original model until 25–50% of layers are moved in lower quantization using our proposed ordering but only until 5–10% if moved using no specific ordering; (b) Adding layer importance to inherently dynamic quantization techniques can further improve their performance, showing that our approach is complementary to other dynamic quantization methods; (c) Quantizing LLMs to lower bits performs substantially better than pruning unless extreme quantization (2-bit) is used; and (d) Layer-wise quantization to lower bits works better in the case of larger LLMs with more layers compared to smaller LLMs with fewer layers",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Do autoregressive Transformer language models require explicit positional encodings (PEs)? The answer is ‘no' provided they have more than one layer—they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without the need for explicit PEs. This follows from the fact that a cascade of (permutation invariant) set processors can collectively exhibit sequence-sensitive behavior in the autoregressive setting. This property has been known since early efforts (contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated, leading to recent rediscoveries. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2/3, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior work, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review the long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their inputs), as well as the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge",

To address this, we propose Confidence-Reward driven Preference Optimization (CRPO), a novel method that combines reward scores with model confidence to improve data selection for fine-tuning. CRPO selects challenging sentence pairs where the model is uncertain or underperforms, leading to more effective learning. While primarily designed for LLMs, CRPO also generalizes to encoder-decoder models like NLLB, demonstrating its versatility.

To address these limitations, we propose a framework motivated by the theory of ideological discourse analysis to analyze news articles related to real-world events. Our framework represents the news articles using a relational structure−talking points, which captures the interaction between entities, their roles, and media frames along with a topic of discussion. It then constructs a vocabulary of repeating themes−prominent talking points, that are used to generate ideology-specific viewpoints (or partisan perspectives). We evaluate our framework's ability to generate these perspectives through automated tasks−ideology and partisan classification tasks, supplemented by human validation. Additionally, we demonstrate straightforward applicability of our framework in creating event snapshots, a visual way of interpreting event discourse.

Previous work by retrieving a set of tokens iteratively with retrieved content prepending to the input poses a high runtime issue, which degrades the inference efficiency of the LLMs because they fail to use the Key-Value (KV) cache efficiently. We propose FlashBack, a modular RALM designed to improve the inference efficiency of RALM with appending context pattern while maintaining decent performance after fine-tuning by Low-Rank Adaption. FlashBack appends retrieved documents at the end of the context for efficiently utilizing the KV cache. We also introduce the Marking Token as two special prompt tokens for marking the appending context during fine-tuning. Our experiments show that FlashBack can improve language modeling performance in perplexity metric. We proved the Marking Token is a usable add-on when fine-tuning models on specific context patterns. By bypassing unnecessary re-computation, FlashBack achieves fast inference speed speed with long context input. The inference speed is up to 4× faster than the prepending counterpart on a 7B LLM (Llama 2) in the runtime test",

Due to resource limitations, SLMs struggle to accurately interpret natural language questions and may overlook critical constraints, leading to challenges such as generating SQL with incorrect logic or incomplete conditions. To address these issues, we propose PARSQL, a novel framework that leverages SQL parsing and reasoning. Specifically, we design PARSer, an SQL parser that extracts constraints from SQL to generate sub-SQLs for data augmentation and producing step-by-step SQL explanations (reason) via both rule-based and LLM-based methods. We define a novel text-to-reason task and incorporate it into multi-task learning, thereby enhancing text-to-SQL performance. Additionally, we employ an efficient SQL selection strategy that conducts direct similarity computation between the generated SQLs and their corresponding reasons to derive the final SQL for post-correction. Extensive experiments show that our PARSQL outperforms models with the same model size on the BIRD and Spider benchmarks. Notably, PARSQL-3B achieves 56.98% execution accuracy on BIRD, rivaling 7B models with significantly fewer parameters, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "A common technique for aligning large language models (LLMs) relies on acquiring human preferences by comparing multiple generations conditioned on a fixed context. This method, however, relies solely on pairwise comparisons, where the generations are evaluated within an identical context. While effective to such conditional preferences often fail to encompass the nuanced and multidimensional nature of human preferences. In this work, we revisit the traditional paradigm of preference acquisition and propose a new axis based on eliciting preferences jointly over the instruction-response pairs. Unlike prior preference optimizations, which are designed for conditional ranking protocols (e.g., DPO), we propose Joint Preference Optimization (JPO), a new preference optimization objective that upweights the joint probability of the chosen instruction-response pair over the rejected instruction-response pair. Interestingly, LLMs trained with joint instruction-response preference data using JPO outperform LLM trained with DPO by 5.2% and 3.3% win-rate for summarization and open-ended dialogue datasets, respectively. Our findings reveal that joint preferences over instruction and response pairs can significantly enhance the alignment of LLMs by tapping into a broader spectrum of human preference elicitation.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological, educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "When different groups' values differ, one approach to model alignment is to steer models at inference time towards each group's preferences. However, techniques like in-context learning only consider similarity when drawing few-shot examples and not cross-group differences in values. We propose SPICA, a framework that accounts for group-level differences during in-context example retrieval. SPICA introduces three designs: scenario banks, group-informed retrieval metrics, and in-context alignment prompts. From an evaluation of SPICA on an alignment task collecting inputs from four demographic groups (n = 544), our metrics retrieve in-context examples that more closely match observed preferences, with the best prompt configuration using multiple contrastive responses to demonstrate examples. In an end-to-end evaluation (n = 120), we observe that SPICA is higher rated than similarity-based retrieval, with groups seeing up to a +0.16 point improvement on a 5 point scale. Additionally, gains from SPICA were more uniform, with all groups benefiting from alignment rather than only some. Finally, we find that while a group-agnostic approach can align to aggregated values, it is not most suited for divergent groups",

    "abstract": "Language models can solve complex reasoning tasks better by learning to generate rationales for their predictions. Often these models know how to solve a task but their auto-regressive decoding nature leads to incorrect results if started incorrectly. We observe that smaller models in particular, when corrected, can solve a task that they would otherwise struggle with. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using a larger model to guide smaller models, which leads to significantly improved performance (up to +24 points on the GSM8K dataset by 7B models). To assist smaller models in initiating the starting step, we propose QuestCoT, where a smaller model first asks how to start before proceeding with a chain of reasoning. On various multistep mathematical reasoning datasets over multiple smaller models, we show that getting the start right can lead to significant performance gains across all models (gains of up to +6 points on GSM8K, +9 on SVAMP, +5 on ASDiv, and +7 on MultiArith)",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to identify directional causal relations between events, including the existence and direction of causality. Previous studies mainly adopt prompt learning paradigm to predict a causal answer word based on a Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for causality existence identification. However, the indecision in selecting answer words from some synonyms and the confusion of indicating opposite causal directions with the same answer word raise more challenges in directional causality identification. Inspired by the strong capabilities of pre-trained Generative Language Models (GLMs) in generating responses or statements, we propose to instruct a GLM to generate causality statements and identify directional event causality by evaluating the generated statements. Specifically, we propose an Instructive Generation and Statement Evaluation method to identify both the existence and direction of causality. We first fine-tune a GLM to instructively generate causality statements based on event description inputs. Then, we evaluate the rationality of the generated statements to determine the existence and direction of event causalities.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in solving mathematical problems, with code-based solutions proving particularly effective. However, the best practice to leverage coding instruction data to enhance mathematical reasoning remains underexplored. This study investigates three key questions: (1) How do different coding styles of mathematical code-based rationales impact LLMs' learning performance? (2) Can general-domain coding instructions improve performance? (3) How does integrating textual rationales with code-based ones during training enhance mathematical reasoning abilities? Our findings reveal that code-based rationales with concise comments, descriptive naming, and hardcoded solutions are beneficial, while improvements from general-domain coding instructions and textual rationales are relatively minor. Based on these insights, we propose CoinMath, a learning strategy designed to enhance mathematical reasoning by diversifying the coding styles of code-based rationales. CoinMath generates a variety of code-based rationales incorporating concise comments, descriptive naming conventions, and hardcoded solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that CoinMath significantly outperforms its baseline model, MAmmoTH, one of the SOTA math LLMs",

    "abstract": "In an age characterized by the proliferation of mis- and disinformation online, it is critical to empower readers to understand the content they are reading. Important efforts in this direction rely on manual or automatic fact-checking, which can be challenging for emerging claims with limited information. Such scenarios can be handled by assessing the reliability and the political bias of the source of the claim, i.e., characterizing entire news outlets rather than individual claims or articles. This is an important but understudied research direction. While prior work has looked into linguistic and social contexts, we do not analyze individual articles or information in social media. Instead, we propose a novel methodology that emulates the criteria that professional fact-checkers use to assess the factuality and political bias of an entire outlet. Specifically, we design a variety of prompts based on these criteria and elicit responses from large language models (LLMs), which we aggregate to make predictions. In addition to demonstrating sizable improvements over strong baselines via extensive experiments with multiple LLMs, we provide an in-depth error analysis of the effect of media popularity and region on model performance. Further, we conduct an ablation study to highlight the key components of our dataset that contribute to these improvements. To facilitate future research, we released our dataset and code",

Our proposed approach combines structured discourse information extraction with a classifier, FDSpotter, for factual consistency verification. We show that adversarial discourse relations pose challenges for language models, but fine-tuning on our annotated data, DiscInfer, achieves competitive performance.

Specifically, we first define interactive hallucination through stance transfer, then construct SHARP, a benchmark built by extracting relations from commonsense knowledge graphs and utilizing LLMs' inherent hallucination properties to simulate multi-role interactions. Extensive experiments confirm our paradigm's effectiveness and stability, examine the factors that influence these metrics, and challenge conventional hallucination mitigation solutions.

To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data pipeline that generates realistic user profiles and private documents, enabling the creation of PersonaBench—a benchmark for evaluating models' ability to understand personal information.

To address this, we introduce a counterfactual data augmentation approach inspired by Variation Theory, a theory of human concept learning that emphasizes the essential features of a concept by focusing on what stays the same and what changes. We use a neuro-symbolic pipeline to pinpoint key conceptual dimensions and use a large language model (LLM) to generate targeted variations along those dimensions. Through a text classification experiment, we show that our approach achieves significantly higher performance when there are fewer annotated data, showing its capability to address the cold start problem in AL.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in language modeling demonstrate the need for high-quality domain-specific training data, especially for tasks that require specialized knowledge. General-purpose models, while versatile, often lack the depth needed for expert-level tasks because of limited domain-specific information. Domain adaptation training can enhance these models, but it demands substantial, high-quality data. To address this, we propose ORBIT, a cost-efficient methodology for curating massive, high-quality domain-specific datasets from noisy web sources, tailored for training specialist large language models. Using astronomy as a primary case study, we refined the 1.3T-token FineWeb-Edu dataset into a high-quality, 10B-token subset focused on astronomy. Fine-tuning LLaMA-3-8B on a 1B-token astronomy subset improved performance on the MMLU astronomy benchmark from 69% to 76% and achieved top results on AstroBench, an astronomy-specific benchmark. Moreover, our model (Orbit-LLaMA) outperformed LLaMA-3-8B-base, with GPT-4o evaluations preferring it in 73% of cases across 1000 astronomy-specific questions. Additionally, we validated ORBIT's generalizability by applying it to law and medicine, achieving a significant improvement of data quality compared to an unfiltered baseline.

The varying degrees of effectiveness observed in these methods highlight both the complexity and importance of addressing this cognitive bias. We believe these effects are inherently rooted in LLMs, and a comprehensive solution that fully addresses SPE may be beyond the scope of this work. However, we have proposed practical strategies, such as using binary choices instead of multiple choices where feasible, limiting prompt length, and placing crucial information at the beginning of prompts. These suggestions are intended to help users, particularly those who may not be experts in the domain of LLMs, to better utilize these models.We agree with the suggestion that a deeper analysis of the relationship between task characteristics and SPE could enhance the manuscript. As it stands, our findings indicate that higher model accuracy tends to correlate with a reduction in SPE, which aligns with expectations—if a model achieves 100% accuracy, it is unlikely to be influenced by SPE. Beyond this, we did not observe any clear relationships, which suggests that SPE may be influenced by a combination of factors, including the specific task, the model used, and the nature of the prompts.

Numerous studies have attempted to apply pre-trained LLMs to single-cell data analysis within one tissue. However, when it comes to cross-tissue cell annotation, LLMs often suffer from unsatisfactory performance due to the lack of specialized biological knowledge regarding genes and tissues. In this paper, we introduce scRAG, a novel framework that incorporates advanced LLM-based RAG techniques into cross-tissue single-cell annotation. scRAG utilizes LLMs to retrieve structured triples from knowledge graphs and unstructured similar cell information from the reference cell database, and it generates candidate cell types. The framework further optimizes predictions by retrieving marker genes from both candidate cells and similar cells to refine its results. Extensive experiments on a cross-tissue dataset demonstrate that our scRAG framework outperforms various baselines, including generalist models, domain-specific methods, and trained classifiers.

We also provide a metric for evaluating target quality that correlates well with human judgment. Our experiments reveal that LLMs outperform TSE in target generation, both when the real target is explicitly and not explicitly mentioned in the text.

In this paper, we systematically investigate various approaches towards reliable LALMs, including training-free methods such as multi-modal chain-of-thought (MCoT), and training-based methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Besides, we identify the limitations of previous evaluation metrics and propose a new metric, the Reliability Gain Index (RGI), to assess the effectiveness of different reliable methods. Our findings suggest that both training-free and training-based methods enhance the reliability of LALMs to different extents. Moreover, we find that awareness of reliability is a \"meta ability\", which can be transferred across different audio modalities, although significant structural and content differences exist among sound, music, and speech",

    "abstract": "Current conversational recommendation systems focus predominantly on text. However, real-world recommendation settings are generally multimodal, causing a significant gap between existing research and practical applications. To address this issue, we propose Muse, the first multimodal conversational recommendation dataset. Muse comprises 83,148 utterances from 7,000 conversations centered around the Clothing domain. Each conversation contains comprehensive multimodal interactions, rich elements, and natural dialogues. Data in Muse are automatically synthesized by a multi-agent framework powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It innovatively derives user profiles from real-world scenarios rather than depending on manual design and history data for better scalability, and then it fulfills conversation simulation and optimization. Both human and LLM evaluations demonstrate the high quality of conversations in Muse. Additionally, fine-tuning experiments on three MLLMs demonstrate Muse's learnable patterns for recommendations and responses, confirming its value for multimodal conversational recommendation.

    "abstract": "The growth in prominence of large language models (LLMs) in everyday life can be largely attributed to their generative abilities, yet some of this is also owed to the risks and costs associated with their use. On one front is their tendency to hallucinate false or misleading information, limiting their reliability. On another is the increasing focus on the computational limitations associated with traditional self-attention based LLMs, which has brought about new alternatives, in particular recurrent models, meant to overcome them. Yet it remains uncommon to consider these two concerns simultaneously. Do changes in architecture exacerbate/alleviate existing concerns about hallucinations? Do they affect how and where they occur? Through an extensive evaluation, we study how these architecture-based inductive biases affect the propensity to hallucinate. While hallucination remains a general phenomenon not limited to specific architectures, the situations in which they occur and the ease with which specific types of hallucinations can be induced can significantly differ based on the model architecture. These findings highlight the need for better understanding both these problems in conjunction with each other, as well as consider how to design more universal techniques for handling hallucinations",

While recent LLMs are typically fine-tuned with tool usage examples during supervised fine-tuning (SFT), questions remain about their ability to develop robust tool-usage skills and can effectively generalize to unseen queries and tools. In this work, we present GenTool, a novel training framework that prepares LLMs for diverse generalization challenges in tool utilization. Our approach addresses two fundamental dimensions critical for real-world applications: Zero-to-One Generalization, enabling the model to address queries initially lacking a suitable tool by adopting and utilizing one when it becomes available, and Weak-to-Strong Generalization, allowing models to leverage enhanced versions of existing tools to solve queries. To achieve this, we develop synthetic training data simulating these two dimensions of tool usage and introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach: optimizing tool ranking, then refining tool selection. Through extensive experiments across four generalization scenarios, we demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the tool-usage capabilities of LLMs ranging from 1B to 8B parameters, achieving performance that surpasses GPT-4o. Furthermore, our analysis also provides valuable insights into the challenges LLMs encounter in tool generalization",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across a variety of complex tasks. One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source framework designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other model to generate patches for the identified files. To mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches and train the two models of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving competitive performance among open-source models with scores of 22.0% and 30.2%. Furthermore, SWE-Fixer reaches state-of-the-art performance (24.7% on Lite and 32.8% on Verified) with PASS_TO_PASS (P2P) filtering. Additionally, our approach requires only two model calls per instance, making it significantly more efficient than existing methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of SWE-Fixer in real-world code-fixing scenarios.We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer",

The automated generation of counterfactual examples remains a challenging task even for large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance on many tasks. In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming three state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals, which we hope will serve as an importantfinding for future research in this direction",

In this paper, we propose a novel three-stage fine-tuning method that enhances the ability of LLMs to detect and correct misleading information in the input, further improving response accuracy and reducing hallucinations. Specifically, the three stages include (1) training LLMs to identify misleading information, (2) training LLMs to correct the misleading information using built-in or external knowledge, and (3) training LLMs to generate accurate answers based on the corrected queries. To evaluate our method, we conducted experiments on three datasets for the hallucination detection task and the question answering (QA) task, as well as two datasets containing misleading information that we constructed. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy and factuality of LLM responses, while also enhancing the ability to detect hallucinations and reducing the generation of hallucinations in the output, particularly when the query contains misleading information",

We evaluate the effectiveness of IRR across various datasets, including both full fine-tuning and LoRA methods.

We conduct 14,400 agentic simulations across 12 advanced LLMs, with extensive experiments and analysis. Results reveal that LLM agents can autonomously engage in catastrophic behaviors and deception, without being deliberately induced.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant attention, which aims to achieve efficient fine-tuning of LLMs with fewer parameters. As a representative PEFT method, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces low-rank matrices to approximate the incremental tuning parameters and achieves impressive performance over multiple scenarios. After that, plenty of improvements have been proposed for further improvement. However, these methods either focus on single-task scenarios or separately train multiple LoRA modules for multi-task scenarios, limiting the efficiency and effectiveness of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. To better adapt to multi-task fine-tuning, in this paper, we propose a novel Mixture of Low-Rank Experts (MoRE) for multi-task PEFT. Specifically, instead of using an individual LoRA for each task, we align different ranks of LoRA module with different tasks, which we named low-rank experts. Moreover, we design a novel adaptive rank selector to select the appropriate expert for each task. By jointly training low-rank experts, MoRE can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of LoRA in multi-task scenarios. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over multiple multi-task benchmarks along with different LLMs to verify model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to traditional LoRA and its variants, MoRE significantly improves the performance of LLMs in multi-task scenarios and incurs no additional inference cost.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained increasing popularity as a promising framework for leveraging the strong language reasoning capabilities in the vision-language domain. Given a wide range of MLLMs, model merging potentially offers a cheap way to aggregate their diverse knowledge into a single MLLM. However, directly plug-in existing model merging approaches often leads to suboptimal performance due to (1) inclusion of harmful models that have over-confident predictions in the target task; (2) the lack of specialized designs for vision-language inputs. To tackle these pain points, we conduct pioneering investigations to dissect the merging procedures and propose an uncertainty-guided MLLM merging algorithm, i.e., UQ-Merge, which i) identifies beneficial candidates for merging, ii) determines the merging order and the number of helpful candidates, and iii) performs appropriate merging. Within our framework, we consider uncertainty quantification on both text and vision inputs to examine the MLLM prediction confidence, and then decide whether and when a MLLM needs to be included. It is worth mentioning that our vision-language uncertainty quantification does not require access to sample labels, making it more practical in various scenarios. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superior MLLM merging performance of UQ-Merge in both held-in and held-out vision-language benchmarks. For example, compared to existing state-of-the-art merging methods, UQ-Merge brings substantial performance improvements of up to 44.3% on average accuracy in 12 datasets.

However, their generated responses often suffer from hallucinations, hindering their widespread adoption in high stakes domains such as law, which can potentially mislead experts and propagate societal harms. To enhance trustworthiness in these systems, one promising approach is to attribute the answer to an actual source, thereby improving the factuality and verifiability of the response. In pursuit of advancing attributed legal question answering, we introduce AQuAECHR, a benchmark comprising information-seeking questions from ECHR jurisprudence along with attributions to relevant judgments. We present strategies to automatically curate this dataset from ECHR case law guides and utilize an LLM-based filtering pipeline to improve dataset quality, as validated by legal experts. Additionally, we assess several LLMs, including those trained on legal corpora, on this dataset to underscore significant challenges with the current models and strategies dealing with attributed QA, both quantitatively and qualitatively",

However, S2ST still faces two main challenges: 1) extracting linguistic features for various speech signals, called cross-modal (CM), and 2) learning alignment of difference languages in long sequences, called cross-lingual (CL). We propose the unit language to overcome the two modeling challenges. The unit language can be considered a text-like representation format, constructed using n-gram language modeling. We implement multi-task learning to utilize the unit language in guiding the speech modeling process. Our initial results reveal a conflict when applying source and target unit languages simultaneously. We propose task prompt modeling to mitigate this conflict.

    "abstract": "Most existing GUI agents typically depend on non-vision inputs like HTML source code or accessibility trees, limiting flexibility across diverse software environments and platforms. Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), though excel at using vision to ground real-world objects, often struggle with accurately localizing GUI elements – a critical requirement for effective GUI automation – due to the semantic gap between real-world objects and GUI elements. In this work, we introduce Ponder & Press, a divide-and-conquer framework for general computer control that uses only visual input. Our approach combines a general-purpose MLLM as an ‘interpreter', responsible for translating high-level user instructions into detailed action descriptions, with a GUI-specific MLLM as a ‘locator' that precisely locates GUI elements for action placement. By leveraging a purely visual input, our agent offers a versatile, human-like interaction paradigm applicable to various applications. Ponder & Press locator outperforms existing models by +22.5% on the ScreenSpot GUI grounding benchmark. More offline and interactive agent benchmarks across various GUI environments – including web pages, desktop software, and mobile UIs – demonstrate that the Ponder & Press framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the potential of visual GUI agents",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across various tasks, showcasing complex problem-solving abilities. Understanding and executing complex rules, along with multi-step planning, are fundamental to logical reasoning and critical for practical LLM agents and decision-making systems. However, evaluating LLMs as effective rule-based executors and planners remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce LogicGame, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the comprehensive rule understanding, execution, and planning capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional benchmarks, LogicGame provides diverse games that contain a series of rules with an initial state, requiring models to comprehend and apply predefined regulations to solve problems. We create simulated scenarios in which models execute or plan operations to achieve specific outcomes. These game scenarios are specifically designed to distinguish logical reasoning from mere knowledge by relying exclusively on predefined rules. This separation allows for a pure assessment of rule-based reasoning capabilities. The evaluation considers not only final outcomes but also intermediate steps, providing a comprehensive assessment of model performance. Moreover, these intermediate steps are deterministic and can be automatically verified. LogicGame defines game scenarios with varying difficulty levels, from simple rule applications to complex reasoning chains, in order to offer a precise evaluation of model performance on rule understanding and multi-step execution. Utilizing LogicGame, we test various LLMs and identify notable shortcomings in their rule-based logical reasoning abilities",

    "abstract": "The structural properties of naturally arising social graphs are extensively studied to understand their evolution. Prior approaches for modeling network dynamics typically rely on rule-based models, which lack realism and generalizability, or deep learning-based models, which require large-scale training datasets. As abstract graph representations of entity-wise interactions, social graphs present an opportunity to explore network evolution mechanisms through realistic simulations of human-item interactions. Leveraging the pre-trained social consensus knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs), we present GraphAgent-Generator (GAG), a novel simulation-based framework for dynamic, text-attributed social graph generation. GAG simulates the temporal node and edge generation processes for zero-shot social graph generation. The resulting graphs adhere to seven key macroscopic network properties, achieving an 11% improvement in microscopic graph structure metrics. Through the node classification benchmarking task, we validate that GAG effectively captures the intricate text-structure correlations in graph generation. Furthermore, GAG supports generating graphs with up to nearly 100,000 nodes or 10 million edges through large-scale LLM-based agent simulation with parallel acceleration, achieving a minimum speed-up of 90.4%.

This paper introduces AD-LLM, the first benchmark that evaluates how LLMs can help with NLP anomaly detection. We examine three key tasks: (i) zero-shot detection, using LLMs' pre-trained knowledge to perform AD without tasks-specific training; (ii) data augmentation, generating synthetic data and category descriptions to improve AD models; and (iii) model selection, using LLMs to suggest unsupervised AD models. Through experiments with different datasets, we find that LLMs can work well in zero-shot AD, that carefully designed augmentation methods are useful, and that explaining model selection for specific datasets remains challenging. Based on these results, we outline six future research directions on LLMs for AD",

Despite their efficiency, LLM-based agents can hardly fully understand each other, which frequently causes errors during the development process. Moreover, the accumulation of errors could easily lead to the failure of the whole project. In order to reduce such errors, we introduce an intention aligned multi-agent framework RTADev, which utilizes a self-correction mechanism to ensure that all agents work based on a consensus. RTADev mimics human teams where individuals are free to start meetings anytime for reaching agreement. Specifically, RTADev integrates an alignment checking phase and a conditional ad hoc group review phase, so that the errors can be effectively reduced with minimum agent communications. Our experiments on various software development tasks show that RTADev significantly improves the quality of generated software code in terms of executability, structural and functional completeness.

Prompt compression aims to reduce the inference cost by minimizing input tokens without compromising on the task performance.

To ensure low latency requirements, we leverage existing Transformer encoder-based token classification model while guiding the learning process with task-specific reward signals using lightweight REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the performance of our method on three diverse and challenging tasks including text summarization, question answering and code summarization.

    "abstract": "Creative story generation has long been a goal of NLP research. While existing methodologies have aimed to generate long and coherent stories, they fall significantly short of human capabilities in terms of diversity and character depth. To address this, we introduce a novel story generation framework called CCI (Character-centric Creative story generation via Imagination). CCI features two modules for creative story generation: IG (Image-Guided Imagination) and MW (Multi-Writer model). In the IG module, we utilize a text-to-image model to create visual representations of key story elements, such as characters, backgrounds, and main plots, in a more novel and concrete manner than text-only approaches. The MW module uses these story elements to generate multiple persona-description candidates and selects the best one to insert into the story, thereby enhancing the richness and depth of the narrative. We compared the stories generated by CCI and baseline models through statistical analysis, as well as human and LLM evaluations. The results showed that the IG and MW modules significantly improve various aspects of the stories' creativity. Furthermore, our framework enables interactive multi-modal story generation with users, opening up new possibilities for human-LLM integration in cultural development.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io/",

To address the limitation, we introduce a new unanswerable question dataset UAQFact, a bilingual dataset with auxiliary factual knowledge created from a Knowledge Graph. Based on UAQFact, we further define two new tasks to measure LLMs' ability to utilize internal and external factual knowledge, respectively. Our experimental results across multiple LLM series show that UAQFact presents significant challenges, as LLMs do not consistently perform well even when they have factual knowledge stored.

To achieve this, we construct a heterogeneous graph that simulates the transmission of non-verbal emotions alongside verbal influences. By applying message passing between nodes, the constructed graph effectively models both the implicit emotional dynamics and explicit verbal interactions.

Experiments on GSM8K and MATH and out-of-domain evaluation demonstrate that our enhanced model significantly boosts task-solving performance by filtering out invalid solutions or iterative refinement.

We formalize a framework for measuring entropy in a sequence-to-sequence task and find that the performance of popular model architectures scales with the entropy. Our work connects systematic generalization to information efficiency, and our results indicate that success at high entropy can be achieved even without built-in priors, and that success at low entropy can serve as a target for assessing progress towards robust systematic generalization",

    "title": "The Inverse Scaling Effect of Pre-Trained Language Model Surprisal Is Not Due to Data Leakage",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token n-gram overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on ‘leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora. Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage",

    "title": "Logical Consistency is Vital: Neural-Symbolic Information Retrieval for Negative-Constraint Queries",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Information retrieval plays a crucial role in resource localization. Current dense retrievers retrieve the relevant documents within a corpus via embedding similarities, which compute similarities between dense vectors mainly depending on word co-occurrence between queries and documents, but overlook the real query intents. Thus, they often retrieve numerous irrelevant documents. Particularly in the scenarios of complex queries such as negative-constraint queries, their retrieval performance could be catastrophic. To address the issue, we propose a neuro-symbolic information retrieval method, namely NS-IR, that leverages first-order logic (FOL) to optimize the embeddings of naive natural language by considering the logical consistency between queries and documents. Specifically, we introduce two novel techniques, logic alignment and connective constraint, to re-rank candidate documents, thereby enhancing retrieval relevance. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset NegConstraint including negative-constraint queries to evaluate our NS-IR's performance on such complex IR scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that NS-IR not only achieves superior zero-shot retrieval performance on web search and low-resource retrieval tasks, but also performs better on negative-constraint queries.

This paper aims to improve label detection that involves multi-round long dialogues by efficiently detecting OOD dialogues and images. We introduce a novel scoring framework named Dialogue Image Aligning and Enhancing Framework (DIAEF) that integrates the visual language models with the novel proposed scores that detect OOD in two key scenarios (1) mismatches between the dialogue and image input pair and (2) input pairs with previously unseen labels. Our experimental results, derived from various benchmarks, demonstrate that integrating image and multi-round dialogue OOD detection is more effective with previously unseen labels than using either modality independently. In the presence of mismatched pairs, our proposed score effectively identifies these mismatches and demonstrates strong robustness in long dialogues. This approach enhances domain-aware, adaptive conversational agents and establishes baselines for future studies",

    "abstract": "For document-level event argument extraction, existing role-based span selection strategies suffer from several limitations: (1) ignoring interrelations among arguments within an event instance; (2) relying on pre-trained language models to capture role semantics at either the event pattern or document, without leveraging pattern-instance associations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-round role representation learning strategy. First, we construct an event pattern-instance graph (EPIG) to comprehensively capture the role semantics embedded in various direct and indirect associations, including those among roles within event patterns, arguments within event instances, and the alignments between patterns and instances. Second, to enhance the learning of role node representation in the graph, we optimize the update mechanisms for both node and edge representations in the EPIG graph. By leveraging the graph attention network, we iteratively update the representations of role nodes and role edges. The role representations learned from the EPIG are then integrated into the original role representations, further enriching their semantic information. Finally, a role representation memory module and a multi-round learning strategy is proposed to retain and refine role representations learned from previously analyzed documents. This memory mechanism enhances the prediction performance in subsequent rounds of span selection. Extensive experiments on three datasets verify the effectiveness of the model",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of AI-based music generation tools is revolutionizing the music industry but also posing challenges to artists, copyright holders, and providers alike. This necessitates reliable methods for detecting such AI-generated content. However, existing detectors, relying on either audio or lyrics, face key practical limitations: audio-based detectors fail to generalize to new or unseen generators and are vulnerable to audio perturbations; lyrics-based methods require cleanly formatted and accurate lyrics, unavailable in practice. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel, practically grounded approach: a multimodal, modular late-fusion pipeline that combines automatically transcribed sung lyrics and speech features capturing lyrics related information within the audio. By relying on lyrical aspects directly from audio, our method enhances robustness, mitigates susceptibility to low-level artifacts, and enables practical applicability. Experiments show that our method, DE-detect, outperforms existing lyrics-based detectors while also being more robust to audio perturbations.

We observe that LVLMs disproportionately focus on a small subset of image tokens—termed blind tokens—which are typically irrelevant to the query (e.g., background or non-object regions). We hypothesize that such attention misalignment plays a key role in generating hallucinated responses. To mitigate this issue, we propose Attentional Vision Calibration (AvisC), a test-time approach that dynamically recalibrates the influence of blind tokens without modifying the underlying attention mechanism. AvisC first identifies blind tokens by analyzing layer-wise attention distributions over image tokens, then employs a contrastive decoding strategy to balance the influence of original and blind-token-biased logits. Experiments on standard benchmarks, including POPE, MME, and AMBER, demonstrate that AvisC effectively reduces hallucinations in LVLMs",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remains a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task—such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task—to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43",

To evaluate the effectiveness of PDF-derived data, we train Japanese LMMs and assess their performance on the Japanese LMM Benchmark. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements, with performance gains ranging from 2.1% to 13.8% on Heron-Bench. Further analysis highlights the impact of PDF-derived data on various factors, such as model size and language models, reinforcing its value as a multimodal resource for Japanese LMMs",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Continual pre-training has long been considered the default strategy for adapting models to non-English languages, but struggles with initializing new embeddings, particularly for non-Latin scripts. In this work, we propose EnerGIZAr, a novel methodology that improves continual pre-training by leveraging statistical word alignment techniques. Our approach utilizes GIZA++ to construct a subword-level alignment matrix between source (English) and target language tokens. This matrix enables informed initialization of target tokenizer embeddings, which provides a more effective starting point for adaptation. We evaluate EnerGIZAr against state-of-the-art initialization strategies such as OFA and FOCUS across four typologically diverse languages: Hindi, Basque, Arabic and Korean. Experimental results on key NLP tasks – including POS tagging, Sentiment Analysis, NLI, and NER – demonstrate that EnerGIZAr achieves superior monolingual performance while also out-performing all methods for cross-lingual transfer when tested on XNLI. With EnerGIZAr, we propose an intuitive, explainable as well as state-of-the-art initialisation technique for continual pre-training of English models",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced \"early dropout\" also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate to **drop dropout** during single-epoch pretraining",

    "title": "Robust and Minimally Invasive Watermarking for EaaS",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Embeddings as a Service (EaaS) is emerging as a crucial role in AI applications. Unfortunately, EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks, highlighting the urgent need for copyright protection. Although some preliminary works propose applying embedding watermarks to protect EaaS, recent research reveals that these watermarks can be easily removed. Hence, it is crucial to inject robust watermarks resistant to watermark removal attacks. Existing watermarking methods typically inject a target embedding into embeddings through linear interpolation when the text contains triggers. However, this mechanism results in each watermarked embedding having the same component, which makes the watermark easy to identify and eliminate. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel embedding-specific watermarking (ESpeW) mechanism to offer robust copyright protection for EaaS. Our approach involves injecting unique, yet readily identifiable watermarks into each embedding. Watermarks inserted by ESpeW are designed to maintain a significant distance from one another and to avoid sharing common components, thus making it significantly more challenging to remove the watermarks. Moreover, ESpeW is minimally invasive, as it reduces the impact on embeddings to less than 1%, setting a new milestone in watermarking for EaaS. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate that ESpeW can even watermark successfully against a highly aggressive removal strategy without sacrificing the quality of embeddings",

    "abstract": "Masked language modeling has become a widely adopted unsupervised technique to pre-train large language models (LLMs). However, the process of selecting tokens for masking is random, and the percentage of masked tokens is typically fixed for the entire training process. In this paper, we propose to adjust the masking ratio and to decide which tokens to mask based on a novel task-informed anti-curriculum learning scheme. First, we harness task-specific knowledge about useful and harmful tokens in order to determine which tokens to mask. Second, we propose a cyclic decaying masking ratio, which corresponds to an anti-curriculum schedule (from hard to easy). We exemplify our novel task-informed anti-curriculum by masking (TIACBM) approach across three diverse downstream tasks: sentiment analysis, text classification by topic, and authorship attribution. Our findings suggest that TIACBM enhances the ability of the model to focus on key task-relevant features, contributing to statistically significant performance gains across tasks.

    "abstract": "Reward modeling in large language models is known to be susceptible to reward hacking, causing models to latch onto superficial features such as the tendency to generate lists or unnecessarily long responses. In RLHF, and more generally during post-training, flawed reward signals often lead to outputs that optimize for these spurious correlates instead of genuine quality or correctness. We propose **Carmo (Context-Aware Reward Modeling)**, a novel approach that first generates dynamic, context-relevant criteria to ground the reward model prior to producing reward scores. Unlike prior methods that use static rubrics, Carmo leverages powerful LLMs to adaptively create evaluation criteria, e.g., logical consistency, clarity, and depth, tailored to the user query. Our theoretical analysis shows that such criteria generation can mitigate reward hacking. We further demonstrate how Carmo can be distilled into smaller models, thereby lowering the computational cost of alignment. We establish a new state-of-the-art performance on zero shot setting for generative models, with a 2.1% improvement on Reward Bench. Furthermore, alignment performed on the Carmo-curated preference dataset achieves **22.5% and 21.1% LC-WR (%) and WR (%) on Mistral-Base (7B)**.

Additionally, we propose historical text prompting to compress dialogue history, facilitating efficient multi-round interactions. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that SLAM-Omni outperforms prior models of similar scale, requiring only 15 hours of training on 4 GPUs with limited data. Notably, it is the first spoken dialogue system to achieve competitive performance with a single-stage training approach, eliminating the need for pre-training on TTS or ASR tasks.

Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to using textual input with large language models (LLMs).

In this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of several combinations of table representations and model types from two perspectives: question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across setups.

While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become uncooperative—yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time, while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for nursing communication training",

    "abstract": "To enhance the interpretability of multimodal unified representations, many studies have focused on discrete unified representations. These efforts typically start with contrastive learning and gradually extend to the disentanglement of modal information, achieving solid multimodal discrete unified representations. However, existing research often overlooks two critical issues: 1) The use of Euclidean distance for quantization in discrete representations often overlooks the important distinctions among different dimensions of features, resulting in redundant representations after quantization; 2) Different modalities have unique characteristics, and a uniform alignment approach does not fully exploit these traits. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Optimization of Codebook (TOC) and Fine and Coarse cross-modal Information Disentangling (FCID). These methods refine the unified discrete representations from pretraining and perform fine- and coarse-grained information disentanglement tailored to the specific characteristics of each modality, achieving significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.

Applying observational approaches familiar from corpus linguistics, we prompt a commonly used, opensource LLM to regenerate text from two domains of permissively licensed English text which are often contained in LLM training data—Wikipedia and news text. This regeneration paradigm allows us to investigate whether LLMs can faithfully match the original human text domains in a fairly semantically-controlled setting. We investigate varying levels of syntactic abstraction, from more simple properties like sentence length, and article readability, to more complex and higher order properties such as dependency tag distribution, parse depth, and parse complexity.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the GPT-4 and LLaMA families, have demonstrated considerable success across diverse tasks, including multiple-choice questions (MCQs). However, these models exhibit a positional bias, particularly an even worse \"anchored bias\" in the GPT-2 family, where they consistently favour the first choice ‘A' in MCQs during inference. This anchored bias challenges the integrity of GPT-2's decision-making process, as it skews performance based on the position rather than the content of the choices in MCQs. In this study, we utilise the mechanistic interpretability approach to identify the internal modules within GPT-2 models responsible for this bias. We focus on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers and attention heads, using the \"logit lens\" method to trace and modify the specific value vectors that contribute to the bias. By updating these vectors within MLP and recalibrating attention patterns to neutralise the preference for the first choice ‘A', we effectively mitigate the anchored bias. Our interventions not only mitigate the bias but also improve the overall MCQ prediction accuracy for the GPT-2 family across various datasets. This work represents the first comprehensive mechanistic analysis of anchored bias from the failing cases in MCQs within the GPT-2 models, introducing targeted, minimal-intervention strategies that significantly enhance GPT2 model robustness and accuracy in MCQs.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Generative Error Correction (GEC) has emerged as a powerful post-processing method to boost the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. In this paper, we first show that GEC models struggle to generalize beyond the specific types of errors encountered during training, limiting their ability to correct new, unseen errors at test time, particularly in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. This phenomenon amplifies with named entities (NEs), where, in addition to insufficient contextual information or knowledge about the NEs, novel NEs keep emerging. To address these issues, we propose DARAG (Data- and Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction), a novel approach designed to improve GEC for ASR in in-domain (ID) and OOD scenarios. First, we augment the GEC training dataset with synthetic data generated using foundational generative models, thereby simulating additional errors from which the model can learn from. For out-of-domain scenarios, we simulate test-time errors from new domains similarly and in an unsupervised fashion. Additionally, to better handle NEs, we introduce retrieval-augmented correction wherein we augment the model input with entities retrieved from a datastore of NEs. Our approach is simple, scalable, and both domain- and language-agnostic. We experiment on multiple datasets and settings, showing that DARAG outperforms all our baselines, achieving 8%–30% relative WER improvements in ID and 10%–33% improvements in OOD settings",

In this paper, we propose a novel disentanglement method that linearly decomposes SSL representations into speaker-specific and speaker-independent components, effectively generating speaker disentangled representations.

This paper addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive investigation of Multilingual Confidence estimation (MlingConf) on LLMs, focusing on both language-agnostic (LA) and language-specific (LS) tasks to explore the performance and language dominance effects of multilingual confidence estimations on different tasks. The benchmark comprises four meticulously checked and human-evaluated high-quality multilingual datasets for LA tasks and one for the LS task tailored to specific social, cultural, and geographical contexts of a language. Our experiments reveal that on LA tasks English exhibits notable linguistic dominance in confidence estimations than other languages, while on LS tasks, using question-related language to prompt LLMs demonstrates better linguistic dominance in multilingual confidence estimations. The phenomena inspire a simple yet effective native-tone prompting strategy by employing language-specific prompts for LS tasks, effectively improving LLMs' reliability and accuracy in LS scenarios",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities across various domains, with recent advancements in challenging reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, solving reasoning tasks often requires an LLM to generate long sequences, incurring O(N) time and memory complexities per token, where N is the current sequence length. To reduce complexities, existing sparsity-based algorithms propose to retain Key-Value (KV) vectors, the intermediate representations of only the most critical tokens. However, these algorithms struggle with the \"impossible trinity\" of accuracy, time, and memory. For example, the state-of-the-art algorithm, Quest, achieves high accuracy with O(L) time but O(N) memory (L is the cache budget, L ≪ N). To address the \"impossible trinity\", in this paper, we identify a new attention pattern during the decode stage of reasoning tasks, where milestone tokens (analogous to lemmas in mathematical proofs) emerge, are utilized, and then become unimportant afterward. Based on this pattern, we propose a new algorithm RaaS that identifies milestone tokens and retains their KV vectors until they are no longer needed, achieving high accuracy with O(L) time and O(L) memory complexities",

    "abstract": "Existing pruning methods for large language models (LLMs) focus on achieving high compression rates while maintaining model performance. Although these methods have demonstrated satisfactory performance in handling a single user's compression request, their processing time increases linearly with the number of requests, making them inefficient for real-world scenarios with multiple simultaneous requests. To address this limitation, we propose a Univeral Model for Customized Compression (UniCuCo) for LLMs, which introduces a StratNet that learns to map arbitrary requests to their optimal pruning strategy. The challenge in training StratNet lies in the high computational cost of evaluating pruning strategies and the non-differentiable nature of the pruning process, which hinders gradient backpropagation for StratNet updates. To overcome these challenges, we leverage a Gaussian process to approximate the evaluation process. Since the gradient of the Gaussian process is computable, we can use it to approximate the gradient of the non-differentiable pruning process, thereby enabling StratNet updates. Experimental results show that UniCuCo is 28 times faster than baselines in processing 64 requests, while maintaining comparable accuracy to baselines",

Previous efforts typically relied on an idealized assumption — patients can accurately report symptoms aligned with their actual health conditions.

To address this critical issue, we emphasize the importance of enabling MDSs to \"listen to patients\" by tackling two key challenges: how to detect misreport and mitigate misreport effectively. In this work, we propose PaMis, a novel framework that can detect patient misreports based on calculating the structural entropy of the dialogue entity graph, and mitigate them through generating controlled clarifying questions.

While applying these tasks is often straightforward, interpreting their results can be challenging. In particular, when a model underperforms, it is often unclear whether this results from a limitation in the cognitive ability being tested or a failure to understand the task itself. A recent study argues that GPT 3.5's declining performance on 2-back and 3-back tasks reflects a working memory capacity limit similar to humans (Gong et al., 2024). By analyzing a range of open-source language models of varying performance levels on these tasks, we show that the poor performance is due at least in part to a limitation in task comprehension and task set maintenance. We challenge the best-performing model with progressively harder versions of the task (up to 10-back) and experiment with alternative prompting strategies, before analyzing model attentions.

However, due to the feature divergence of an attribute (resp. object) when combined with different objects (resp. attributes), it is challenging to learn disentangled primitive features that are general across different compositions. To this end, we propose the solution of cross-composition feature disentanglement, which takes multiple primitive-sharing compositions as inputs and constrains the disentangled primitive features to be general across these compositions. More specifically, we leverage a compositional graph to define the overall primitive-sharing relationships between compositions, and build a task-specific architecture upon the recently successful large pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) CLIP, with dual cross-composition disentangling adapters (called L-Adapter and V-Adapter) inserted into CLIP's frozen text and image encoders, respectively.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "While long-context large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable document processing capabilities, their prohibitively high training costs often hinder customized applications. To mitigate this issue, we propose __Sequential Chunk-wise Optimization (SeCO)__, a memory-efficient training paradigm that partitions lengthy inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk independently constructs its computational graph and performs localized backpropagation, ensuring that only one chunk's forward activations are stored in memory. Building on SeCO, we further introduce __Sparse Chunk-wise Optimization (SpaCO)__, which reduces computational overhead by selectively propagating gradients to specific chunks and incorporates a carefully designed compensation factor to ensure unbiased gradient estimation. SpaCO decouples the computational cost of backpropagation from the context length, enabling training time to gradually converge to inference time as sequences become longer. Implemented as lightweight training wrappers, both SeCO and SpaCO offer substantial practical benefits. For example, when fine-tuning an 8B model with LoRA on a single RTX 3090 GPU, SeCO expands maximum sequence length from 1K to 16K tokens, while SpaCO demonstrates accelerated training speed—achieving up to 3× faster than SeCO under the same experimental setup. These innovations provide new insights into optimizing long-context models, making them more accessible for practical applications.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities across diverse tasks and languages. In this study, we focus on natural language understanding in three classical languages—Sanskrit, Ancient Greek and Latin—to investigate the factors affecting cross-lingual zero-shot generalization. First, we explore named entity recognition and machine translation into English. While LLMs perform equal to or better than fine-tuned baselines on out-of-domain data, smaller models often struggle, especially with niche or abstract entity types. In addition, we concentrate on Sanskrit by presenting a factoid question–answering (QA) dataset and show that incorporating context via retrieval-augmented generation approach significantly boosts performance. In contrast, we observe pronounced performance drops for smaller LLMs across these QA tasks. These results suggest model scale as an important factor influencing cross-lingual generalization. Assuming that models used such as GPT-4o and Llama-3.1 are not instruction fine-tuned on classical languages, our findings provide insights into how LLMs may generalize on these languages and their consequent utility in classical studies",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Current EEG/MEG-to-text decoding systems suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on teacher-forcing methods, which compromises robustness during inference, (2) sensitivity to session-specific noise, hindering generalization across subjects, and (3) misalignment between brain signals and linguistic representations due to pre-trained language model over-dominance. To overcome these challenges, we propose BrainECHO (Brain signal decoding via vEctor-quantized speCtrogram reconstruction for WHisper-enhanced text generatiOn), a multi-stage framework that employs decoupled representation learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both EEG and MEG datasets. Specifically, BrainECHO consists of three stages: (1) Discrete autoencoding, which transforms continuous Mel spectrograms into a finite set of high-quality discrete representations for subsequent stages. (2) Frozen alignment, where brain signal embeddings are mapped to corresponding Mel spectrogram embeddings in a frozen latent space, effectively filtering session-specific noise through vector-quantized reconstruction, yielding a 3.65% improvement in BLEU-4 score. (3) Constrained decoding fine-tuning, which leverages the pre-trained Whisper model for audio-to-text translation, balancing signal adaptation with knowledge preservation, and achieving 74%-89% decoding BLEU scores without excessive reliance on teacher forcing. BrainECHO demonstrates robustness across sentence, session, and subject-independent conditions, passing Gaussian noise tests and showcasing its potential for enhancing language-based brain-computer interfaces",

However, MCIT faces challenges in mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting (CF) and enhancing Knowledge Transfer (KT). Existing works combine Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) and LoRA to address these. However, using a fixed number of shared LoRA blocks across tasks can lead to the overwriting of acquired knowledge, making MLLMs harder to handle CF and KT. Therefore, we propose the **Prog**ressive **LoRA** framework (ProgLoRA), which contains a progressive LoRA pool and trains a new LoRA block for each incremental task to reduce knowledge interference. Specifically, ProgLoRA has two key mechanisms: task-aware allocation for effectively leveraging acquired knowledge at current task and task recall for realigning the model with learned tasks. Additionally, considering different application scenarios, we design a static ProgLoRA for the more idealized basic setting and a dynamic ProgLoRA for the more realistic challenging setting. Experiments on the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that ProgLoRA outperforms existing approaches",

    "abstract": "Recent generative large language models (LLMs) show remarkable performance in non-English languages, but when prompted in those languages they tend to express higher harmful social biases and toxicity levels. Prior work has shown that finetuning on specialized datasets can mitigate this behavior, and doing so in English can transfer to other languages. In this work, we investigate the impact of different finetuning methods on the model's bias and toxicity, but also on its ability to produce fluent and diverse text. We reduce biases by finetuning on curated non-harmful text, but find only direct preference optimization to be effective for mitigating toxicity. The mitigation caused by applying these methods in English also transfers to non-English languages. We find evidence that the extent to which transfer takes place can be predicted by the amount of data in a given language present in the model's pretraining data. However, this transfer of bias and toxicity mitigation often comes at the expense of decreased language generation ability in non-English languages, highlighting the importance of developing language-specific bias and toxicity mitigation methods",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the surge of large language models, there has been a push to formally characterize the symbolic abilities intrinsic to the transformer architecture. A programming language, called RASP, has been proposed, which can be directly compiled into transformer weights to implement these algorithms. However, the tasks that can be implemented in RASP are often uncommon to learn from natural unsupervised data, showing a mismatch between theoretical capabilities of the transformer architecture, and the practical learnability of these capabilities from unsupervised data. We propose tracr-injection, a method that allows us to distill algorithms written in RASP directly into a pre-trained language model. We showcase our method by injecting 3 different algorithms into a language model. We show how our method creates an interpretable subspace within the model's residual stream, which can be decoded into the variables present in the code of the RASP algorithm. Additionally, we found that the proposed method can improve out-of-distribution performance compared to our baseline, indicating that indeed a more symbolic mechanism is taking place in the inner workings of the model.

Automated prompt optimization techniques address this challenge but the major of them rely on randomly selected evaluation subsets, which fail to represent the full dataset, leading to unreliable evaluations and suboptimal prompts. Existing coreset selection methods, designed for LLM benchmarking, are unsuitable for prompt optimization due to challenges in clustering similar samples, high data collection costs, and the unavailability of performance data for new or private datasets. To overcome these issues, we propose IPOMP, an Iterative evaluation data selection approach for effective Prompt Optimization using real time Model Performance. IPOMP is a two-stage approach that selects representative and diverse samples using semantic clustering and boundary analysis, followed by iterative refinement with real-time model performance data to replace redundant samples. Evaluations on two datasets BIG-bench and LIAR, and two models GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o-mini, show that IPOMP improves effectiveness by at least 1.6% to 3.1%, and stability by at least 50% to 55.5% compared with the best baseline across the studied datasets and models, with minimal computational overhead below 1%. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that our real-time performance-guided refinement approach can be universally applied to enhance existing coreset selection methods",

    "abstract": "As large language models advance toward superhuman performance, ensuring their alignment with human values and abilities grows increasingly complex. Weak-to-strong generalization offers a promising approach by leveraging predictions from weaker models to guide stronger systems, but its effectiveness could be constrained by the inherent noise and inaccuracies in these weak predictions. To address this, we propose a theoretically grounded approach that replaces forward KL divergence—whose mass-covering behavior risks overfitting to imperfect weak signals—with reverse KL divergence. Reverse KL divergence's zero-forcing effect prioritizes high-confidence predictions, effectively mitigating the influence of unreliable weak supervision. Theoretically, we extend existing bounds and derive tighter lower bounds for both forward and reverse KL divergence. Notably, when a sufficiently pre-trained strong model is fine-tuned on the last linear layer, reverse KL guarantees that it outperforms its weak supervisor by the magnitude of their disagreement. Empirically, we demonstrate that reverse KL and reverse cross-entropy not only enable strong models to outperform those trained with forward KL and standard cross-entropy across most settings, but also exhibit greater robustness to noisy labels",

In comparison to existing methods, iReVa reveals better interpretability and a stronger capacity for carrying traceable edits.

In this work, we evaluate the resilience of state-of-the-art MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed adversarial attacks. We develop a pipeline that fine-tunes language models using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward human-written text (HWT), obtaining generations more challenging to detect by current models. Additionally, we analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and how detectors rely on \"linguistic shortcuts\" to detect texts. Our results show that detectors can be easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in detecting performances. This highlights the importance of improving detection methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) has brought a lot of attention to their safety alignment. However, existing methods have primarily focused on model undersafety, where the model responds to hazardous queries, while neglecting oversafety, where the model refuses to answer safe queries. In this paper, we introduce the concept of safety calibration, which systematically addresses both undersafety and oversafety. Specifically, we present VSCBench, a novel dataset of 3,600 image-text pairs that are visually or textually similar but differ in terms of safety, which is designed to evaluate safety calibration across image-centric and text-centric scenarios. Based on our benchmark, we evaluate safety calibration across eleven widely used VLMs. Our extensive experiments revealed major issues with both undersafety and oversafety. We further investigated four approaches to improve the model's safety calibration. We found that even though some methods effectively calibrated the models' safety problems, these methods also lead to the degradation of models' utility. This trade-off underscores the urgent need for advanced calibration methods, and our benchmark provides a valuable tool for evaluating future approaches",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness—the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT",

Despite growing attention to LLM factuality, the effect of response length on factuality remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate this relationship by first introducing an automatic and bi-level long-form factuality evaluation framework, which achieves high agreement with human annotations while being cost-effective. Using this framework, we conduct controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual precision, confirming the presence of length bias. To explain this phenomenon, we empirically examine three hypotheses: error propagation, long context, and facts exhaustion. Our results reveal that facts exhaustion, where the model gradually exhausts more reliable knowledge, is the primary cause of factual degradation, rather than the other two hypotheses",

Various datasets have been proposed to assess LLMs' social reasoning capabilities, but each is designed with a distinct focus, and none have explored how models' social reasoning capabilities evolve during model size scaling or reasoning tokens scaling. In light of this, we optimize the evaluation of LLMs' social reasoning from both data and model perspectives, constructing progressively difficult levels of social reasoning data and systematically exploring how LLMs' social reasoning capabilities evolve. Furthermore, through an in-depth analysis of DeepSeek-R1's reasoning trajectories, we identify notable cognitive \"Aha Moment\" and the reasons for its reasoning errors. Experiments reveal that long-thought logical capabilities and cognitive thinking are key to scaling LLMs' social reasoning capabilities.

In this paper, we study the task of KG-driven RAG and propose a novel Similar Graph Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimGRAG) method. It effectively addresses the challenge of aligning query texts and KG structures through a two-stage process: (1) query-to-pattern, which uses an LLM to transform queries into a desired graph pattern, and (2) pattern-to-subgraph, which quantifies the alignment between the pattern and candidate subgraphs using a graph semantic distance (GSD) metric. We also develop an optimized retrieval algorithm that efficiently identifies the top-k subgraphs within 1-second on a 10-million-scale KG.

With their expanded context windows, LCLMs can process entire knowledge bases and perform retrieval and reasoning directly – a capability we define as In-Context Retrieval and Reasoning (ICR^2). However, existing benchmarks like LOFT often overestimate LCLM performance by providing overly simplified contexts. To address this, we introduce ICR^2, a benchmark that evaluates LCLMs in more realistic scenarios by including confounding passages retrieved with strong retrievers. We then propose three methods to enhance LCLM performance: (1) retrieve-then-generate fine-tuning, (2) retrieval-attention-probing, which uses attention heads to filter and de-noise long contexts during decoding, and (3) joint retrieval head training alongside the generation head. Our evaluation of five well-known LCLMs on LOFT and ICR^2 demonstrates significant gains with our best approach applied to Mistral-7B: +17 and +15 points by Exact Match on LOFT, and +13 and +2 points on ICR^2, compared to vanilla RAG and supervised fine-tuning, respectively.

The common approach involves using a bi-encoder to compute the semantic similarity between a query and documents. However, the scalar similarity often fail to reflect enough information, hindering the interpretation of retrieval results. In addition, this process primarily focuses on global semantics, overlooking the finer-grained semantic relationships between the query and the document's content. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, Generation Augmented Retrieval (GeAR), which not only improves the global document-query similarity through contrastive learning, but also integrates well-designed fusion and decoding modules. This enables GeAR to generate relevant context within the documents based on a given query, facilitating learning to retrieve local fine-grained information.Furthermore, when used as a retriever, GeAR does not incur any additional computational cost over bi-encoders. GeAR exhibits competitive retrieval performance across diverse scenarios and tasks. Moreover, qualitative analysis and the results generated by GeAR provide novel insights into the interpretation of retrieval results.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of LLMs in multi-turn human-agent interactions presents significant challenges, particularly due to the complexity and variability of user behavior. In this paper, we introduce HammerBench, a novel benchmark framework for assessing LLMs' function-calling capabilities in real-world, multi-turn dialogues. HammerBench simulates diverse mobile assistant use cases, incorporating imperfect instructions, dynamic question-answer trajectories, intent and argument shifts, and the indirect use of external information through pronouns. To construct this benchmark, we curate a comprehensive dataset derived from popular mobile app functionalities and anonymized user logs, complemented by a cost-effective data generation pipeline leveraging open-source models. HammerBench is further augmented with fine-grained interaction snapshots and metrics, enabling detailed evaluation of function-calling performance across individual conversational turns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HammerBench by evaluating several leading LLMs and uncovering key performance trends. Our experiments reveal that different types of parameter name errors are a significant source of failure across different interaction scenarios, highlighting critical areas for further improvement in LLM robustness for mobile assistant applications",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning. Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task's language and format distributions for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines (MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable, learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically with automatic prompt optimizers",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models have achieved impressive performance across various natural language generation tasks. However, their lack of a reliable control mechanism limits their effectiveness in applications that require strict adherence to predefined taxonomies, syntactic structures, or domain-specific rules. Existing approaches, such as fine-tuning and prompting, remain insufficient to ensure compliance with these requirements, particularly in low-resource scenarios and structured text generation tasks.To address these limitations, we introduce GRAMMAR-LLM, a novel framework that integrates formal grammatical constraints into the LLM decoding process. GRAMMAR-LLM enforces syntactic correctness in linear time while maintaining expressiveness in grammar rule definition. To achieve this, we define a class of grammars, called LL(prefix), – which we show to be equivalent to LL(1) – specifically designed for their use with LLMs. These grammars are expressive enough to support common tasks such as hierarchical classification, vocabulary restriction, and structured parsing. We formally prove that LL(prefix) grammars can be transformed into LL(1) grammars in linear time, ensuring efficient processing via deterministic pushdown automata. We evaluate GRAMMAR-LLM across diverse NLP tasks, including hierarchical classification, sign language translation, and semantic parsing. Our experiments, conducted on models such as LLaMA 3 (for classification and translation) and AMRBART (for parsing), demonstrate that GRAMMAR-LLM consistently improves task performance across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned settings",

In response, we introduce MANBench (Multimodal Ability Norms Benchmark), a bilingual benchmark (English and Chinese) comprising 1,314 questions across nine tasks, spanning knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based domains. MANBench emphasizes intuitive reasoning, seamless cross-modal integration, and real-world complexity, providing a rigorous evaluation framework.Through extensive human experiments involving diverse participants, we compared human performance against state-of-the-art MLLMs. The results indicate that while MLLMs excel in tasks like Knowledge and Text-Image Understanding, they struggle with deeper cross-modal reasoning tasks such as Transmorphic Understanding, Image Consistency, and Multi-image Understanding. Moreover, both humans and MLLMs face challenges in highly complex tasks like Puzzles and Spatial Imagination.MANBench highlights the strengths and limitations of MLLMs, revealing that even advanced models fall short of achieving human-level performance across many domains. We hope MANBench will inspire efforts to bridge the gap between MLLMs and human multimodal capabilities. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/micdz/MANBench/",

(2022) showed that additionally training them on interleaved sequences of text and images can lead to the emergence of in-context learning capabilities. However, the dataset they used, M3W, is not public and is only in English. There have been attempts to reproduce their results but the released datasets are English-only. In contrast, current multilingual and multimodal datasets are either composed of caption-like only or medium-scale or fully private data. This limits mLLM research for the 7,000 other languages spoken in the world. We therefore introduce mOSCAR, to the best of our knowledge the first large-scale multilingual and multimodal document corpus crawled from the web. It covers 163 languages, 303M documents, 200B tokens and 1.15B images. We carefully conduct a set of filtering and evaluation steps to make sure mOSCAR is sufficiently safe, diverse and of good quality. We additionally train two types of multilingual model to prove the benefits of mOSCAR: (1) a model trained on a subset of mOSCAR and captioning data and (2) a model trained on captioning data only. The model additionally trained on mOSCAR shows a strong boost in few-shot learning performance across various multilingual image-text tasks and benchmarks, confirming previous findings for English-only mLLMs. The dataset will be made publicly accessible under the Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license",

To address these challenges, we propose DALR (Dual-level Alignment Learning for Multimodal Sentence Representation). For cross-modal alignment, we propose a consistency learning module that softens negative samples and utilizes semantic similarity from an auxiliary task to achieve fine-grained cross-modal alignment. Additionally, we contend that sentence relationships go beyond binary positive-negative labels, exhibiting a more intricate ranking structure. To better capture these relationships and enhance representation quality, we integrate ranking distillation with global intra-modal alignment learning.

    "abstract": "Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise in generating chart rendering code, editing charts via code presents a greater challenge. This task demands MLLMs to integrate chart understanding and reasoning capacities, which are labor-intensive. While many MLLMs claim such editing capabilities, current evaluations rely on limited case studies, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive evaluation framework.In this work, we propose ChartEdit, a new high-quality benchmark designed for chart editing tasks. This benchmark comprises 1,405 diverse editing instructions applied to 233 real-world charts, with each instruction-chart instance having been manually annotated and validated for accuracy. Utilizing ChartEdit, we evaluate the performance of 10 mainstream MLLMs across two types of experiments at both the code and chart levels.The results suggest that large-scale models can generate code to produce images that partially match the reference images.However, their ability to generate accurate edits according to the instructions remains limited. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) model achieves a score of only 59.96, highlighting significant challenges in precise modification. In contrast, small-scale models, including chart-domain models, struggle both with following editing instructions and generating overall chart images, underscoring the need for further development in this area.

    "abstract": "The safety alignment ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is prone to be degraded by the integration of the vision module compared to its LLM backbone. We investigate this phenomenon, dubbed as \"safety alignment degradation\" in this paper, and show that the challenge arises from the representation gap that emerges when introducing vision modality to VLMs. In particular, we show that the representations of multi-modal inputs shift away from that of text-only inputs which represent the distribution that the LLM backbone is optimized for. At the same time, the safety alignment capabilities, initially developed within the textual embedding space, do not successfully transfer to this new multi-modal representation space. To reduce safety alignment degradation, we introduce Cross-Modality Representation Manipulation (CMRM), an inference time representation intervention method for recovering the safety alignment ability that is inherent in the LLM backbone of VLMs, while simultaneously preserving the functional capabilities of VLMs. The empirical results show that our framework significantly recovers the alignment ability that is inherited from the LLM backbone with minimal impact on the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs even without additional training. Specifically, the unsafe rate of LLaVA-7B on multi-modal input can be reduced from 61.53% to as low as 3.15% with only inference-time intervention",

Inevitably, the retrieved passages based on similarity search may be irrelevant to the given question, and the aggregation of these passages can confuse the model to give a correct answer. To improve the performance of RALM in such conditions, we propose layer-knowledge guided attention for RALMs, which harnesses the layer-wise knowledge of LLMs to optimize per-layer attention on useful passages, making the model pay attention to the most relevant content and ignore irrelevant ones. Specifically, we first systematically study LLM's attention patterns and their relationship with the accuracy of RALM responses, where middle-focus attentions play a crucial role in selectively gathering relevant information. Based on this, a layer-wise passage estimator leverages the varied knowledge encoded across LLM layers to assess not only passage relevance scores but also associated confidences. Finally, a relevance-aware passage fusion enables selective attention to relevant passages, mitigating distractibility and positional bias of causal attention. Experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods on RALM benchmarks",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in various domains, the safety of LLMs is increasingly attracting attention to avoid their powerful capabilities being misused. Existing jailbreak methods create a forced instruction-following scenario, or search adversarial prompts with prefix or suffix tokens to achieve a specific representation manually or automatically. However, they suffer from low efficiency and explicit jailbreak patterns, far from the real deployment of mass attacks to LLMs. In this paper, we point out that simply rewriting the original instruction can achieve a jailbreak, and we find that this rewriting approach is learnable and transferable. We propose the **R**ewrite to **J**ailbreak (R2J) approach, a transferable black-box jailbreak method to attack LLMs by iteratively exploring the weakness of the LLMs and automatically improving the attacking strategy. The jailbreak is more efficient and hard to identify since no additional features are introduced. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of R2J, and we find that the jailbreak is also transferable to multiple datasets and various types of models with only a few queries.

We introduce the first text-based and multimodal LLMs capable of sign language processing called SignAlignLM, and propose new prompting and fine-tuning strategies incorporating sign linguistic rules and conventions. We show that LLMs can be generalized interfaces for both spoken and signed languages if trained with a multitasking paradigm. Our code and model checkpoints are open-source",

    "title": "NegVQA: Can Vision Language Models Understand Negation?",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future VLM development. Project page available at https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/",

    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising results on a range of reasoning benchmarks—particularly in formal logic, mathematical tasks, and Chain-of-Thought prompting—less is known about their capabilities in unconstrained natural language reasoning. Argumentative reasoning, a form of reasoning naturally expressed in language and central to everyday discourse, presents unique challenges for LLMs due to its reliance on context, implicit assumptions, and value judgments. This paper addresses a gap in the study of reasoning in LLMs by presenting the first large-scale evaluation of their unconstrained natural language reasoning capabilities based on natural language argumentation. The paper offers three contributions: (i) the formalisation of a new strategy designed to evaluate argumentative reasoning in LLMs: argument-component selection; (ii) the creation of the Argument Reasoning Tasks (ART) dataset, a new benchmark for argument-component selection based on argument structures for natural language reasoning; and (iii) an extensive experimental analysis involving four different models, demonstrating the limitations of LLMs on natural language reasoning tasks",

Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models.

Many supervised and zero-shot detectors have already been proposed, yet their effectiveness and precision remain disputed.

We systematically analyze the current research with respect to this misunderstanding, conduct an in-depth comparative analysis of the benchmarks, and validate our claim using state-of-the-art LLM detectors.Our contributions open the realm of authorship analysis technology for understanding and tackling the problem of LLM detection",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has been widely adopted to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning is inconsistent across tasks with different reasoning types. This work presents a novel perspective to understand CoT behavior through the lens of confirmation bias in cognitive psychology. Specifically, we examine how model internal beliefs, approximated by direct question-answering probabilities, affect both reasoning generation (Q → R) and reasoning-guided answer prediction (QR → A) in CoT. By decomposing CoT into a two-stage process, we conduct a thorough correlation analysis in model beliefs, rationale attributes, and stage-wise performance. Our results provide strong evidence of confirmation bias in LLMs, such that model beliefs not only skew the reasoning process but also influence how rationales are utilized for answer prediction. Furthermore, the interplay between task vulnerability to confirmation bias and the strength of beliefs also provides explanations for CoT effectiveness across reasoning tasks and models. Overall, this study provides a valuable insight for the needs of better prompting strategies that mitigate confirmation bias to enhance reasoning performance.

    "abstract": "Foundation models for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have shown promising capabilities in capturing gene expression patterns. However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory relationships dynamically, and (2) a novel edge perturbation strategy that perturb GRNs with biologically-informed co-expression links to augment graph neural network training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three representative downstream tasks across multiple model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRNFormer. It achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines: 3.6\\\\% increase in drug response prediction correlation, 9.6\\\\% improvement in single-cell drug classification AUC, and 1.1\\\\% average gain in gene perturbation prediction accuracy",

Detecting humblebragging is important for machines to better understand the nuances of human language, especially in tasks like sentiment analysis and intent recognition. However, this topic has not yet been studied in computational linguistics. For the first time, we introduce the task of automatically detecting humblebragging in text. We formalize the task by proposing a 4-tuple definition of humblebragging and evaluate machine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs) on this task, comparing their performance with humans. We also create and release a dataset called HB-24, containing 3,340 humblebrags generated using GPT-4o. Our experiments show that detecting humblebragging is non-trivial, even for humans.

To cover more reasoning types, we summarize various reasoning types from real-world questions. To reason on both tables and text, we require the questions to incorporate tables and text as much as possible. Based on SCITAT, we propose a baseline (CAR), which combines various reasoning methods to address different reasoning types and process tables and text at the same time.

To address these issues, we propose Entropy-based Exploration Depth Conduction (Entro-duction), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the exploration depth during multi-step reasoning by monitoring LLM's output entropy and variance entropy. We employ these two features to capture the model's uncertainty of the current step and the fluctuation of uncertainty across consecutive reasoning steps. Based on the observed entropy changes, the LLM selects whether to deepen, expand, or stop exploration according to the probability, which facilitates the trade-off between the reasoning accuracy and exploration effectiveness.

Building on this argument and drawing on relevant literature from linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics, we provide new definitions of stereotyping, demeaning, and erasure. We then use our framework to develop a granular taxonomy of illocutionary acts that cause representational harms, going beyond the high-level taxonomies presented in previous work. We also discuss the ways that our framework and taxonomy can support the development of valid measurement instruments. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework and taxonomy via a case study that engages with recent conceptual debates about what constitutes a representational harm and how such harms should be measured",

One major challenge in such evaluation is that LLMs may have developed shortcuts by encountering the head entity \"Scarlett Johansson\" and the answer entity \"United States\" in the same training sequences or merely guess the answer based on frequency-based priors. To prevent shortcuts, we exclude test queries where the head and answer entities might have co-appeared during training. Through careful selection of relations and facts and systematic removal of cases where models might guess answers or exploit partial matches, we construct an evaluation dataset SOCRATES (ShOrtCut-fRee lATent rEaSoning). We observe that LLMs demonstrate promising latent multi-hop reasoning abilities without exploiting shortcuts, but only for certain types of queries. For queries requiring latent recall of countries as the intermediate answer, the best models achieve 80% latent composability, but this drops to just 5% for the recall of years. Comparisons with Chain-of-Thought highlight a significant gap between the ability of models to reason latently versus explicitly. Analysis reveals that latent representations of the intermediate answer are constructed more often in queries with higher latent composability, and shows the emergence of latent multi-hop reasoning during pretraining",

    "abstract": "Climate change adaptation requires the understanding of disruptive weather impacts on society, where large language models (LLMs) might be applicable. However, their effectiveness is under-explored due to the difficulty of high-quality corpus collection and the lack of available benchmarks. The climate-related events stored in regional newspapers record how communities adapted and recovered from disasters. However, the processing of the original corpus is non-trivial. In this study, we first develop a disruptive weather impact dataset with a four-stage well-crafted construction pipeline. Then, we propose WXImpactBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the capacity of LLMs on disruptive weather impacts. The benchmark involves two evaluation tasks, multi-label classification and ranking-based question answering. Extensive experiments on evaluating a set of LLMs provide first-hand analysis of the challenges in developing disruptive weather impact understanding and climate change adaptation systems. The constructed dataset and the code for the evaluation framework are available to help society protect against vulnerabilities from disasters",

    "abstract": "Quantizing large language models (LLMs) is essential for reducing memory and computational costs in natural language processing. Existing methods combine quantization with parameter-efficient fine-tuning but often fail to meet practical performance requirements. This paper introduces MeMoTune, a novel fine-tuning framework for quantized LLMs. By employing a measure and moment approach within a low-rank approximation framework in probability measure space, MeMoTune optimizes the objective function for superior fine-tuning results. The update process is further refined through scaled gradient, enhancing convergence efficiency and noise robustness. Experiments on tasks like text generation, summarization, and understanding show MeMoTune significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, e.g. fine-tuning Llama2-13B on GSM8K improves accuracy by 5.5%, while fine-tuning DeBERTaV3-base on CoLA of GLUE increases Matthews correlation by 1.7%.

    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) have excelled in various broad domains. However, to ensure their safe and effective integration into real-world educational settings, they must demonstrate proficiency in specific, granular areas of knowledge. Existing cloze-style benchmarks, commonly used to evaluate LMs' knowledge, have three major limitations. They: 1) do not cover the educational domain; 2) typically focus on low-complexity, generic knowledge or broad domains, which do not adequately assess the models' knowledge in specific subjects; and 3) often rely on templates that can bias model predictions. Here, we introduce MALAMUTE, a multilingual, template-free, and highly granular probing dataset comprising expert-written, peer-reviewed probes from 71 university-level textbooks across three languages (English, Spanish, and Polish). MALAMUTE is the first education-based cloze-style dataset. It covers eight domains, each with up to 14 subdomains, further broken down into concepts and concept-based prompts, totaling 33,361 university curriculum concepts and 116,887 prompts. MALAMUTE's fine granularity, educational focus, and inclusion of both sentence-level and paragraph-level prompts make it an ideal tool for evaluating LMs' course-related knowledge. Our evaluation of masked and causal LMs on MALAMUTE shows that despite overall proficiency, they have significant gaps in knowledge when examined closely on specific subjects, hindering their safe use in classrooms and underscoring the need for further development",

However, a persistent challenge lies in the limited semantics derived from the raw data. To address this issue, researchers have explored enhancing textual ABSA with additional augmentations, they either craft audio, text and linguistic features based on the input, or rely on user-posted images. Yet these approaches have their limitations: the former three formations are heavily overlap with the original data, which undermines their ability to be supplementary while the user-posted images are extremely dependent on human annotation, which not only limits its application scope to just a handful of text-image datasets, but also propagates the errors derived from human mistakes to the entire downstream loop. In this study, we explore the way of generating the sentimental image that no one has ever ventured before. We propose a novel Sentimental Image Generation method that can precisely provide ancillary visual semantics to reinforce the textual extraction as shown in Figure 1.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in generating long-form content, they frequently present a hazard of producing factual inaccuracies or hallucinations. An effective strategy to mitigate this hazard is to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to detect hallucinations after the generation. The primary challenge resides in the comprehensive elicitation of the intrinsic knowledge acquired during their pre-training phase. However, existing methods that employ multi-step reasoning chains predominantly fall short of addressing this issue. Moreover, since existing methods for hallucination detection tend to decompose text into isolated statements, they are unable to understand the contextual semantic relations in long-form content. In this paper, we study a novel concept, self-elicitation, to leverage self-generated thoughts derived from prior statements as catalysts to elicit the expression of intrinsic knowledge and understand contextual semantics. We present a framework, SelfElicit, to integrate self-elicitation with graph structures to effectively organize the elicited knowledge and facilitate factual evaluations. Extensive experiments on five datasets in various domains demonstrate the effectiveness of self-elicitation and the superiority of our proposed method",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of LLMs has sparked extensive research into their factual knowledge. Current works find that LLMs fall short on questions around low-frequency entities. However, such proofs are unreliable since the questions can differ not only in entity frequency but also in difficulty themselves. So we introduce **ComparisonQA** benchmark, containing **283K** abstract questions, each instantiated by a pair of high-frequency and low-frequency entities. It ensures a controllable comparison to study the role of knowledge frequency in the performance of LLMs. Because the difference between such a pair is only the entity with different frequencies. In addition, we use both correctness and uncertainty to develop a two-round method to evaluate LLMs' knowledge robustness. It aims to avoid possible semantic shortcuts which is a serious problem of current QA study. Experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, exhibit particularly low robustness regarding low-frequency knowledge. Besides, we find that uncertainty can be used to effectively identify high-quality and shortcut-free questions while maintaining the data size. Based on this, we propose an automatic method to select such questions to form a subset called **ComparisonQA-Hard**, containing only hard low-frequency questions",

Secondly, we employ two different levels of sliding window-based balanced label strategies to stabilize the training process of the streaming segmentation model and enhance training convergence speed. Finally, by adding a one-dimensional bounding-box regression task for text sequences within the window, we restructure the training approach of STS tasks, shifting from sentence classification to sequence segmentation, thereby aligning the training objectives with the task objectives, which further enhanced the model's performance.

In high-stakes applications such as medical diagnosis, a stronger guarantee is often required: the predicted sets must provide consistent coverage per query (conditional coverage guarantee).

We evaluate the cross-lingual robustness of this RAG setting by formalizing several modes for multilingual retrieval. Our experiments on several LLMs show that incorporating perspectives from diverse languages can in fact improve robustness; retrieving multilingual documents best improves response consistency and decreases geopolitical bias over RAG with purely in-language documents. We also consider how RAG responses utilize presented documents, finding a much wider variance in the linguistic distribution of response citations, when querying in low-resource languages.

A primary challenge in studying multilingual scaling is the difficulty of analyzing individual language performance due to cross-lingual transfer. To tackle this, we shift the focus from individual languages to language families. We introduce and validate a hypothesis that the test cross-entropy loss for each language family is determined solely by its own sampling ratio, independent of other languages in the mixture. This insight simplifies the complexity of multilingual scaling and make the analysis scalable to an arbitrary number of languages. Building on this hypothesis, we derive a power-law relationship that links performance with dataset size, model size and sampling ratios. This relationship enables us to predict performance across various combinations of the above three quantities, and derive the optimal sampling ratios at different model scales. To demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed scaling law, we perform a large-scale empirical study, training more than 100 models on 23 languages spanning 5 language families. Our experiments show that the optimal sampling ratios derived from small models (85M parameters) generalize effectively to models that are several orders of magnitude larger (1.2B parameters), offering a resource-efficient approach for multilingual LM training at scale",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Dense retrievers are widely used in information retrieval and have also been successfully extended to other knowledge intensive areas such as language models, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Unfortunately, they have recently been shown to be vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks in which a malicious user injects a small fraction of adversarial passages into the retrieval corpus to trick the system into returning these passages among the top-ranked results for a broad set of user queries. Further study is needed to understand the extent to which these attacks could limit the deployment of dense retrievers in real-world applications. In this work, we propose Approximate Greedy Gradient Descent (AGGD), a new attack on dense retrieval systems based on the widely used HotFlip method for efficiently generating adversarial passages. We demonstrate that AGGD can select a higher quality set of token-level perturbations than HotFlip by replacing its random token sampling with a more structured search. Experimentally, we show that our method achieves a high attack success rate on several datasets and using several retrievers, and can generalize to unseen queries and new domains. Notably, our method is extremely effective in attacking the ANCE retrieval model, achieving attack success rates that are 15.24% and 17.44% higher on the NQ and MS MARCO datasets, respectively, compared to HotFlip. Additionally, we demonstrate AGGD's potential to replace HotFlip in other adversarial attacks, such as knowledge poisoning of RAG systems",

Although we focus on climate science to illustrate its effectiveness, our approach can potentially be adapted for other specialized domains. Existing methods often neglect curated taxonomies—hierarchies of verified entities and relationships—and LLMs frequently struggle to extract KGs in specialized domains. Our approach addresses these gaps by anchoring extraction to expert-curated taxonomies, aligning entities and relations with domain semantics, and validating LLM outputs using RAG against the domain taxonomy. Through a climate science case study using our annotated dataset of 25 publications (1,705 entity-publication links, 3,618 expert-validated relationships), we demonstrate that taxonomy-guided LLM prompting combined with RAG-based validation reduces hallucinations by 23.3% while improving F1 scores by 13.9% compared to baselines without the proposed techniques. Our contributions include: 1) a generalizable methodology for taxonomy-aligned KG construction; 2) a reproducible annotation pipeline, 3) the first benchmark dataset for climate science information retrieval; and 4) empirical insights into combining structured taxonomies with LLMs for specialized domains. The dataset, including expert annotations and taxonomy-aligned outputs, is publicly available at https://github.com/Jo-Pan/ClimateIE, and the accompanying framework can be accessed at https://github.com/Jo-Pan/TaxoDrivenKG",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning seeks to remove unimportant weights for inference speedup with minimal accuracy impact. However, existing methods often suffer from accuracy degradation without full-model sparsity-aware fine-tuning. This paper presents Wanda++, a novel pruning framework that outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by utilizing decoder-block-level regional gradients. Specifically, Wanda++ improves the pruning score with regional gradients for the first time and proposes an efficient regional optimization method to minimize pruning-induced output discrepancies between the dense and sparse decoder output. Notably, Wanda++ improves perplexity by up to 32% over Wanda in the language modeling task and generalizes effectively to downstream tasks. Moreover, despite updating weights with regional optimization, Wanda++ remains orthogonal to sparsity-aware fine-tuning, further reducing perplexity with LoRA in great extend. Our approach is lightweight, pruning a 7B LLaMA model in under 10 minutes on a single H100 GPU",

    "abstract": "Human trafficking (HT) remains a critical issue, with traffickers increasingly leveraging online escort advertisements to advertise victims anonymously. Existing detection methods, including text-based Authorship Attribution (AA), overlook the multimodal nature of these ads, which combine text and images. To bridge this gap, we introduce MATCHED, a multimodal AA dataset comprising 27,619 unique text descriptions and 55,115 unique images sourced from Backpage across seven U.S. cities in four geographic regions. This study extensively benchmarks text-only, vision-only, and multimodal baselines for vendor identification and verification tasks, employing multitask (joint) training objectives that achieve superior classification and retrieval performance on in-sample and out-of-data distribution datasets. The results demonstrate that while text remains the dominant modality, integrating visual features adds stylistic cues that enrich model performance. Moreover, text-image alignment strategies like CLIP and BLIP2 struggle due to low semantic overlap and vague connections between the modalities of escort ads, with end-to-end multimodal training proving more robust. Our findings emphasize the potential of multimodal AA to combat HT, providing Law Enforcement Agencies with robust tools to link advertisements and disrupt trafficking networks",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "High-quality paraphrases are easy to produce using instruction-tuned language models or specialized paraphrasing models. Although this capability has a variety of benign applications, paraphrasing attacks—paraphrases applied to machine-generated texts—are known to significantly degrade the performance of machine-text detectors. This motivates us to consider the novel problem of paraphrase inversion, where, given paraphrased text, the objective is to recover an approximation of the original text. The closer the approximation is to the original text, the better machine-text detectors will perform. We propose an approach which frames the problem as translation from paraphrased text back to the original text, which requires examples of texts and corresponding paraphrases to train the inversion model. Fortunately, such training data can easily be generated, given a corpus of original texts and one or more paraphrasing models. We find that language models such as GPT-4 and Llama-3 exhibit biases when paraphrasing which an inversion model can learn with a modest amount of data. Perhaps surprisingly, we also find that such models generalize well, including to paraphrase models unseen at training time. Finally, we show that when combined with a paraphrased-text detector, our inversion models provide an effective defense against paraphrasing attacks, and overall our approach yields an average improvement of +22% AUROC across seven machine-text detectors and three different domains",

    "abstract": "LLMs are increasingly developed through distributed supply chains, where model providers create base models that deployers customize with system prompts for task-specific applications and safety alignment. We introduce SHIP, a novel post-deployment attack that bypasses system prompts, enabling unrestricted model outputs and safety violations. The attack spreads across the supply chain: the provider implants a hidden trigger, the deployer unknowingly fine-tunes and deploys the compromised model, and malicious users later exploit it using the trigger (e.g., obtained via underground market), as real-world software supply chain breaches. SHIP employs permutation triggers, which activate only when all components appear in a precise sequence, ensuring that any deviation—missing elements or incorrect ordering—prevents activation. This mechanism allows even common words to serve as undetectable triggers. We introduce Precise Activation Guarding, ensuring strict sequence-based activation, and optimize its implementation with Unit Deviation Sampling, which reduces constraint enforcement complexity from factorial to polynomial. Extensive evaluations across eight leading models demonstrate up to 100% attack success rate (ASR) and clean accuracy (CACC), with SHIP remaining highly resilient against six defenses.

The PCFP addresses a fundamental question in morphological processing: how do speakers accurately generate inflected forms of words when presented with incomplete paradigms? This problem is particularly salient when modeling complex inflectional systems. We focus on Spanish verbal paradigms, where certain verbs follow an irregular L-shaped pattern, where the first-person singular present indicative stem matches the stem used throughout the present subjunctive mood. We formulate the problem as a morphological reinflection task. Specifically, we investigate the role of input frequency in the acquisition of regular versus irregular L-shaped patterns in transformer models. By systematically manipulating the input distributions and analyzing model behavior, we reveal four key findings: 1) Models perform better on L-shaped verbs compared to regular verbs, especially in uneven frequency conditions; 2) Robust primacy effects are observed, but no consistent recency effects; 3) Memorization becomes more prominent as the proportion of L-shaped verbs increases; 4) There is a tendency to regularize L-shaped verbs when their consonant alternation pairs are rare or absent in the training data",

Due to the simplicity of these problems, the model cannot encounter test problems that are fundamentally different from those it has seen during training.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address this limitation, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities. Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.

In this paper, we propose R3Mem, a memory network that optimizes both information Retention and Retrieval through Reversible context compression. Specifically, R3Mem employs virtual memory tokens to compress and encode infinitely long histories, further enhanced by a hierarchical compression strategy that refines information from document- to entity-level for improved assimilation across granularities. For retrieval, R3Mem employs a reversible architecture, reconstructing raw data by invoking the model backward with compressed information. Implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it can integrate seamlessly with any Transformer-based model. Experiments demonstrate that our memory design achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-context language modeling and retrieval-augmented generation tasks.

The dataset provides diverse privacy-oriented prompts that guide VLMs to perform targeted Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for precise localization of sensitive text, while the training strategy ensures effective adaptation of VLMs to privacy-preserving tasks.

This imbalance leads to **Tool Overuse**, where models unnecessarily rely on external tools for tasks solvable with parametric knowledge, increasing computational overhead. Inspired by human metacognition, we introduce **SMART** (Strategic Model-Aware Reasoning with Tools), a paradigm that enhances an agent's self-awareness to optimize task handling and reduce tool overuse. To support this paradigm, we introduce **SMART-ER**, a dataset spanning three domains, where reasoning alternates between parametric knowledge and tool-dependent steps, with each step enriched by rationales explaining when tools are necessary. Through supervised training, we develop **SMARTAgent**, a family of models that dynamically balance parametric knowledge and tool use. Evaluations show that SMARTAgent reduces tool use by 24% while improving performance by over 37%, enabling 7B-scale models to match its 70B counterpart and GPT-4. Additionally, SMARTAgent generalizes to out-of-distribution test data like GSM8K and MINTQA, maintaining accuracy with just one-fifth the tool calls.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Video generation has many unique challenges beyond those of image generation. The temporal dimension introduces extensive possible variations across frames, over which consistency and continuity may be violated. In this work, we evaluate the emergence of new concepts and relation transitions as time progresses in a video, which we refer to as Temporal Compositionality. We propose TC-Bench, a benchmark of meticulously crafted text prompts, ground truth videos, and new evaluation metrics. The prompts articulate the initial and final states of scenes, effectively reducing ambiguities for frame development. In addition, by collecting corresponding ground-truth videos, the benchmark can be used for text-to-video and image-to-video generation. We develop new metrics to measure the completeness of component transitions, which demonstrate significantly higher correlations with human judgments than existing metrics. Our experiments reveal that contemporary video generators are still weak in prompt understanding and achieve less than 20% of the compositional changes, highlighting enormous improvement space. Our analysis indicates that current video generation models struggle to interpret descriptions of compositional changes and synthesize various components across different time steps",

    "title": "DAM: Dynamic Attention Mask for Long-Context Large Language Model Inference Acceleration",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Long-context understanding is crucial for many NLP applications, yet transformers struggle with efficiency due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Sparse attention methods alleviate this cost but often impose static, predefined masks, failing to capture heterogeneous attention patterns. This results in suboptimal token interactions, limiting adaptability and retrieval accuracy in long-sequence tasks. This work introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that assigns adaptive masks at the attention-map level, preserving heterogeneous patterns across layers and heads. Unlike existing approaches, our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning and predefined mask structures while maintaining computational efficiency. By learning context-aware attention structures, it achieves high alignment with full-attention models, ensuring minimal performance degradation while reducing memory and compute overhead. This approach provides a scalable alternative to full attention, enabling the practical deployment of large-scale Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing retrieval performance.

    "abstract": "The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in \"aligning\" LLMs has raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting with user interactions. We develop a \"no-consensus\" benchmark by curating examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human non-agreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided",

In this study, we interview sixteen domain experts across two domains to understand their processes of document research, and compare it to the current state of NLP systems. We find that our participants processes are idiosyncratic, iterative, and rely extensively on the social context of a document in addition its content, and that approaches in NLP and adjacent fields that explicitly center the document as an object, rather than as merely a container for text, tend to better reflect our participants' priorities.

However, our study reveals a significant security vulnerability in batch prompting: malicious users can inject attack instructions into a batch, leading to unwanted interference across all queries, which can result in the inclusion of harmful content, such as phishing links, or the disruption of logical reasoning. In this paper, we construct BatchSafeBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 150 attack instructions of two types and 8k batch instances, to study the batch prompting vulnerability systematically. Our evaluation of both closed-source and open-weight LLMs demonstrates that all LLMs are susceptible to batch prompting attacks. We then explore multiple defending approaches. While the prompting-based defense shows limited effectiveness for smaller LLMs, the probing-based approach achieves about 95% accuracy in detecting attacks. Additionally, we perform a mechanistic analysis to understand the attack and identify attention heads that are responsible for it",

While most studies focus on evaluating the capabilities of state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision Language Models (VLMs) through task accuracy (e.g., visual question answering, grounding), our work explores the related but complementary aspect of consistency – the ability of a VLM to produce semantically similar or identical responses to semantically similar queries. We note that consistency is a fundamental prerequisite (necessary but not sufficient condition) for robustness and trust in VLMs. Armed with this perspective, we propose the MM-Rbenchmark, which allows us to analyze performance, in terms of consistency and accuracy, of SoTA VLMs on three tasks: Question Rephrasing, Image Restyling, and Context Reasoning. Our analysis reveals that consistency does not always align with accuracy, indicating that models with higher accuracy are not necessarily more consistent, and vice versa. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective mitigation strategy in the form of an adapter module trained to minimize inconsistency across prompts. With our proposed strategy, we are able to achieve absolute improvements of 5.7% and 12.5%, on average on widely used VLMs such as BLIP-2 and LLaVa 1.5M in terms of consistency over their existing counterparts",

We quantify the memory strength of LLMs by measuring the divergence in LLMs' responses to different paraphrases of the same question, which is not considered by previous works. We also generate evidence in various styles to examine LLMs' behavior. Our results show that for questions with high memory strength, LLMs are more likely to rely on internal memory. Furthermore, presenting paraphrased evidence significantly increases LLMs' receptiveness compared to simple repetition or adding details.

In the practical use of MLLMs, users have full control over the interaction process with the model, such as using their own collected photos and posing arbitrary open-ended questions. Traditional backdoor attacks that rely on adding external triggers are less applicable. To this end, we introduce a new shadow-activated backdoor attacking paradigm in this paper, wherein attacks implicitly inject malicious content into the responses of MLLMs when the responses explicitly relate to the shadowed object, i.e., without any triggers. To facilitate the shadow-activated backdoor attack, we present a novel framework named BadMLLM to achieve the desired behaviors by constructing a poisoned dataset using GPT-4 Vision and implementing an attention-regularized tuning strategy to address the semantic discontinuity between the original response and the inserted promotion. Extensive experimental results conducted on five MLLMs, three objects, and two types of promotion slogans have demonstrated impressive performance in achieving both efficacy and utility goals, thereby highlighting the significant potential risks concealed within MLLMs",

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, yet they often struggle with visual arithmetic, seemingly simple capabilities like object counting or length comparison, which are essential for relevant complex tasks like chart understanding and geometric reasoning. In this work, we first investigate the root causes of this deficiency through a suite of probing tasks focusing on basic visual arithmetic. Our analysis reveals that while pre-trained vision encoders typically capture sufficient information, the text decoder often fails to decode it correctly for arithmetic reasoning. To address this, we propose CogAlign, a novel post-training strategy inspired by Piaget's theory of cognitive development. CogAlign trains VLMs to recognize invariant properties under visual transformations. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the performance of three diverse VLMs on our proposed probing tasks. Furthermore, CogAlign enhances performance by an average of 4.6% on CHOCOLATE and 2.9% on MATH-VISION, outperforming or matching supervised fine-tuning methods while requiring only 60% less training data. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalizability of CogAlign in improving fundamental visual arithmetic capabilities and their transfer to downstream tasks",

There are two main reasons: (1) users are typically concerned with only the top-K results, making top-K ranking more important, and (2) tail items often lack precise feedback, making top-K ranking more reliable. Based on this, we propose K-order Ranking Preference Optimization (KPO) by extending the DPO's Plackett-Luce model to accommodate top-K rankings. Additionally, recognizing that the number of important items can vary across queries, we extend KPO to dynamically determine appropriate K for different samples and introduce a curriculum learning strategy to boost training efficiency.

While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning—a pattern that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them reduces attack success rates by up to 40%",

However, most prior work on program repair focuses on isolated elements, such as classes or functions, neglecting their interdependencies, which limits repair accuracy. We present SynFix, a RelationGraph-based approach that integrates LLMs with structural search and synchronization techniques for coordinated program repair across codebases. SynFix constructs a RelationGraph to capture relationships among classes, functions, variables, and their interactions (e.g., imports, inheritance, dependencies). Each RelationGraph node includes detailed code descriptions to help LLMs understand root causes and retrieve relevant contexts. By analyzing one-hop nodes in the RelationGraph, SynFixensures repairs account for dependent updates across components.

Evaluated on SWE-bench datasets, SynFix resolves 52.33% of issues in SWE-bench-lite (300 GitHub issues), 55.8% in SWE-bench-verified (500 issues), and 29.86% in SWE-bench-full (2,294 issues), outperforming baselines such as Swe-Agent, Agentless and AutoCodeRover.

    "abstract": "We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce the latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents—while preserving their contextual dependencies—enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.

Then, this teacher model guides the large-scale poisoned student model in unlearning the backdoor, leveraging PEFT. Theoretical analysis suggests that W2SDefense has the potential to enhance the student model's ability to unlearn backdoor features, preventing the activation of the backdoor.

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "The safe deployment of large language models (LLMs) necessitates comprehensive safety evaluations through red teaming. However, existing methods face challenges in managing semantic intricacies and optimizing the efficiency of the search process. To overcome these limitations, we propose Better Red Teaming (BRT)—an innovative framework that reconceptualizes test case generation as a strategic planning problem, leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). A notable advancement of our approach is the incorporation of LLMs as world models, enabling the prediction of state transitions and simulation of long-term outcomes throughout the search process. By jointly optimizing objectives related to conditional mutual information and diversity, we improve the world model's capacity to follow actions while maintaining output diversity. Extensive experiments conducted across a range of LLM architectures demonstrate that BRT achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates without sacrificing computational efficiency",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "The success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often relies on high-resolution schemes that preserve image details, while these approaches also generate an excess of visual tokens, leading to a substantial decrease in model efficiency. A typical VLM includes a visual encoder, a text encoder, and an LLM. Recent studies suggest pruning visual tokens based on visual and textual priors to accelerate VLMs without additional training costs. However, these methods often overlook prompt semantics or suffer from biased self-attention in the LLM. Inspired by the efficient mechanisms of the human brain for multimodal understanding, we introduce AdaV, a novel training-free visual token pruning method. By emulating the neural pathways that preprocess visual and auditory information before the reasoning stage, we shift text-guided visual attention redirection to the pre-LLM stage, which reduces biased token pruning and enhances model robustness with a limited visual token budget. A Self-adaptive Cross-modality Attention Redirection (SCAR) module is further proposed that effectively merges and redirects visual attention with text-to-image attention. Extensive experiments on seven challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our AdaV achieves SOTA performance in training-free VLM acceleration and can be plug-and-play on various VLMs. We plan to open-source the code upon publication",

Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted.

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth in the size and complexity of large language models (LLMs), the costs associated with their training and inference have escalated significantly. Research indicates that certain layers in LLMs harbor substantial redundancy, and pruning these layers has minimal impact on the overall performance. While various layer pruning methods have been developed based on this insight, they generally overlook the finer-grained redundancies within the layers themselves. In this paper, we delve deeper into the architecture of LLMs and demonstrate that finer-grained pruning can be achieved by targeting redundancies in multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks. We propose a novel, training-free structured pruning approach called BlockPruner. Unlike existing layer pruning methods, BlockPruner segments each Transformer layer into MHA and MLP blocks. It then assesses the importance of these blocks using perplexity measures and applies a heuristic search for iterative pruning. We applied BlockPruner to LLMs of various sizes and architectures and validated its performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. Experimental results show that BlockPruner achieves more granular and effective pruning compared to state-of-the-art baselines",

In this paper, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs' implicit bias towards certain demographics by attacking them from a psychometric perspective to elicit agreements to biased viewpoints. Inspired by psychometric principles in cognitive and social psychology, we propose three attack approaches, i.e., Disguise, Deception, and Teaching. Incorporating the corresponding attack instructions, we built two benchmarks: (1) a bilingual dataset with biased statements covering four bias types (2.7K instances) for extensive comparative analysis, and (2) BUMBLE, a larger benchmark spanning nine common bias types (12.7K instances) for comprehensive evaluation. Extensive evaluation of popular commercial and open-source LLMs shows that our methods can elicit LLMs' inner bias more effectively than competitive baselines. Our attack methodology and benchmarks offer an effective means of assessing the ethical risks of LLMs, driving progress toward greater accountability in their development",

We first introduce LongBench-Cite, an automated benchmark for assessing current LLMs' performance in long-context question answering with citations (LQAC), revealing considerable room for improvement. To this end, we propose CoF (Coarse to Fine), a novel pipeline that utilizes off-the-shelf LLMs to automatically construct long-context QA instances with precise sentence-level citations, and leverage this pipeline to construct LongCite-45k, a large-scale SFT dataset for LQAC. Finally, we train LongCite-8B and LongCite-9B using the constructed dataset, successfully enabling the generation of accurate responses and fine-grained citations in one pass. The evaluation results on LongBench-Cite show that our trained models achieve state-of-the-art citation quality, surpassing advanced proprietary models including GPT-4o.

This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments",

Only in particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes translation result while ensuring fast speed and as less LLM usage as possible is thereby required.

The root of this issue lies in the absence of fine-grained supervision during the optimization process. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sentence-level Preference Optimization (ASPO), which evaluates individual sentences for more precise preference optimization. By dynamically calculating adaptive rewards at the sentence level based on model predictions, ASPO enhances response content assessment without additional models or parameters. This significantly improves the alignment of multimodal features. Extensive experiments show that ASPO substantially enhances the overall performance of multimodal models",

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) has brought new opportunities to knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but also introduces challenges such as semantic misalignment and reasoning noise. Semantic parsing (SP), previously a mainstream approach for KGQA, enables precise graph pattern matching by mapping natural language queries to executable logical forms. However, it faces limitations in scalability and generalization, especially when dealing with complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.In this work, we propose a Fine-Grained Semantic Parsing (FGSP) framework for KGQA. Our framework constructs a fine-grained mapping library via phrase-level segmentation of historical question-logical form pairs, and performs online retrieval and fusion of relevant subgraph fragments to answer complex queries. This fine-grained, compositional approach ensures tighter semantic alignment between questions and knowledge graph structures, enhancing both interpretability and adaptability to diverse query types. Experimental results on two KGQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of FGSP, with a notable 18.5% relative F1 performance improvement over the SOTA on the complex multi-hop CWQ dataset.

While KGs provide structured, semantically rich representations well-suited for reasoning, most existing verification methods rely on unstructured text corpora, limiting their ability to effectively leverage KGs. Additionally, despite possessing strong reasoning abilities, modern LLMs struggle with multi-step modular pipelines and reasoning over KGs without adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose ClaimPKG, an end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates LLM reasoning with structured knowledge from KGs. Specifically, the main idea of ClaimPKG is to employ a lightweight, specialized LLM to represent the input claim as pseudo-subgraphs, guiding a dedicated subgraph retrieval module to identify relevant KG subgraphs. These retrieved subgraphs are then processed by a general-purpose LLM to produce the final verdict and justification. Extensive experiments on the FactKG dataset demonstrate that ClaimPKG achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines in this research field by 9%-12% accuracy points across multiple categories. Furthermore, ClaimPKG exhibits zero-shot generalizability to unstructured datasets such as HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively combining structured knowledge from KGs with LLM reasoning across various LLM backbones",

However, existing LoRA's shared parameter space paradigm introduces parameter interference, leading to a gap in generalization performance for specific tasks compared to full fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-separated low-rank adapter, called Subspace Low-Rank Adaptation (SuLoRA). The core idea of SuLoRA is to account for task differences by decomposing LoRA's parameter matrix into multiple independent subspaces and assigning them differentially to distinct tasks. This prevents interference across tasks and enhances the effectiveness of low-rank adaptation. Additionally, SuLoRA achieves higher rank expansion by freezing the A matrix, further improving generalization capability. We conduct extensive experiments on various NLP tasks, demonstrating that SuLoRA significantly outperforms LoRA in trainable parameter efficiency and overall model performance. Furthermore, we validate SuLoRA's effectiveness in domain generalization and multi-modal tasks, showcasing its strong generalization ability",

    "abstract": "Recent multimodal retrieval methods have endowed text-based retrievers with multimodal capabilities by utilizing pre-training strategies for visual-text alignment. They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our ablation studies and analyses explicitly verify the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the text-dominant issue.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is effective for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, RLHF's complex process limits its ability to continually learn human feedback, making it impractical for real-world applications where the deployed model continuously receives feedback from users. The non-RL-based method, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is not primitively favorable for Continual Learning (CL). We observe that when combined with Experiment Relay (ER) for CL, DPO tends to significantly widen the gap in the probability of human-preferred and dispreferred responses. Consequently, this diminishes the diversity in model generation, potentially leading to model collapse. To overcome the above challenges, we propose the Continual Optimal Policy Regularization (COPR), a novel non-RL offline method to convert the historical optimal policies into optimization constraints when continually learning new preferences. We first derive a moderate reward function from the pairwise ranking loss and then use the moderate reward to calculate a new sampling distribution to construct novel learning objectives and constraints. We also provide formal proof of the learnability of COPR. The experimental results show that COPR outperforms strong CL baselines on our proposed benchmark, in terms of reward-based, GPT-4 evaluations and human assessment",

    "abstract": "The alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for ensuring their safety and reliability in practical applications. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an efficient method that directly optimizes models using preference pairs, significantly reducing resource demands. However, the effectiveness of DPO heavily depends on the data quality, which is frequently compromised by noise. In this work, we propose 𝛾-PO, a dynamic target margin preference optimization algorithm that adjust reward margins at the pairwise level. By introducing instance-specific margin calibration, 𝛾-PO strategically prioritizes high-confidence pairs (those demonstrating higher reward margins) while suppressing potential noise from ambiguous pairs. Moreover, 𝛾-PO is a plug-and-play method, compatible with variants of DPO that rely on reward margin between preference pairs. Across benchmarks such as AlpacaEval2 and Arena-Hard, 𝛾-PO achieves an average 4.4% improvement over other baselines, setting new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, 𝛾-PO requires minimal code changes and has a negligible impact on training efficiency, making it a robust solution for enhancing LLMs alignment.

    "abstract": "This paper systematically addresses the challenge of rule retrieval, a crucial yet underexplored area. Vanilla retrieval methods using sparse or dense retrievers to directly search for relevant rules to support downstream reasoning, often suffer from low accuracy. This is primarily due to a significant semantic gap between the instantiated facts in the queries and the abstract representations of the rules. Such misalignment results in suboptimal retrieval quality, which in turn negatively impacts reasoning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Self-Induction Augmented Retrieval (SIAR), a novel approach that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to induce potential inferential rules that might offer benefits for reasoning by abstracting the underlying knowledge and logical structure in queries. These induced rules are then used for query augmentation to improve retrieval effectiveness. Additionally, we introduce Rule Relevance ReEstimate (R3), a method that re-estimates the relevance of retrieved rules by assessing whether the abstract knowledge they contain can be instantiated to align with the facts in the queries and the helpfulness for reasoning.

    "abstract": "Natural language interaction has long served as the primary medium through which humans exchange ideas. A key enabler of this communication is the human capacity for Theory of Mind (ToM)—the ability to infer and align with the mental states of others. ToM is usually modeled as components of desires, beliefs, and intentions. Research in linguistics and psychology has shown that people oftentimes reveal their ToM through pragmatic aspects of language. Considering the advancements in natural language generation and perception that Large Language Models (LLMs) have made in recent years, a critical question arises in relation to ToM: can LLM-powered agents develop similar abilities for inferring mental states during natural language communication? This study investigates the extent to which open-source LLaMA models can represent and retain ToM-related constructs, and whether these internal representations contribute to a coherent mental state modeling in a given conversation. Additionally, we explore the potential for manipulating ToM-related information to generate more aligned responses. Empirical evaluations of LLaMA-3 models (3B and 8B) demonstrate that ToM-informed alignment improves response quality, achieving win rates of 63% and 67%, respectively. These findings suggest that integrating ToM principles can enhance alignment in LLM-based conversational agents.

Although it helps address the limitations of large language models (LLMs) with fixed input length constraints, the recursive merging process can amplify LLM hallucinations, increasing the risk of factual inaccuracies. In this paper, we seek to mitigate hallucinations by enriching hierarchical merging with context from the source document. Specifically, we propose different approaches to contextual augmentation ranging from *replacing* intermediate summaries with relevant input context, to *refining* them while using the context as supporting evidence, and *aligning* them implicitly (via citations) to the input. Experimental results on datasets representing legal and narrative domains show that contextual augmentation consistently outperforms zero-shot and hierarchical merging baselines for the Llama 3.1 model family. Our analysis further reveals that refinement methods tend to perform best when paired with extractive summarization for identifying relevant input",

    "title": "Self-Reasoning Language Models: Unfold Hidden Reasoning Chains with Few Reasoning Catalyst",
    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Inference-time scaling has attracted much attention which significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning tasks by increasing the length of Chain-of-Thought. These longer intermediate reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In this work, we introduce Self-Reasoning Language Model (SRLM), where the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM not only enhances the model's initial performance but also ensures more stable and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM achieves an average absolute improvement of more than +2.5 points across five reasoning tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH on two backbone models. Moreover, it brings more improvements with more times of sampling during inference, such as absolute +7.89 average improvement with 64 sampling times, revealing the in-depth, diverse and creative reasoning paths in SRLM against the strong baseline",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "The filter bubble is a notorious issue in Recommender Systems (RSs), characterized by users being confined to a limited corpus of information or content that strengthens and amplifies their pre-established preferences and beliefs. Most existing methods primarily aim to analyze filter bubbles in the relatively static recommendation environment. Nevertheless, the filter bubble phenomenon continues to exacerbate as users interact with the system over time. To address these issues, we propose a novel paradigm, Hypergraph-Aware Multi-Grained Preference Learning to Burst Filter Bubbles in Conversational Recommendation System (HyperCRS), aiming to burst filter bubbles by learning multi-grained user preferences during the dynamic user-system interactions via natural language conversations. HyperCRS develops Multi-Grained Hypergraph (user-, item-, and attribute-grained) to explore diverse relations and capture high-order connectivity. It employs Hypergraph-Empowered Policy Learning, which includes Multi-Grained Preference Modeling to model user preferences and Preference-based Decision Making to disrupt filter bubbles during user interactions. Extensive results on four publicly CRS-based datasets show that HyperCRS achieves new state-of-the-art performance, and the superior of bursting filter bubbles in the CRS",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential for offensive language detection, yet their ability to handle annotation disagreement remains underexplored. Disagreement samples, which arise from subjective interpretations, pose a unique challenge due to their ambiguous nature. Understanding how LLMs process these cases, particularly their confidence levels, can offer insight into their alignment with human annotators. This study systematically evaluates the performance of multiple LLMs in detecting offensive language at varying levels of annotation agreement. We analyze binary classification accuracy, examine the relationship between model confidence and human disagreement, and explore how disagreement samples influence model decision-making during few-shot learning and instruction fine-tuning. Our findings reveal that LLMs struggle with low-agreement samples, often exhibiting overconfidence in these ambiguous cases. However, utilizing disagreement samples in training improves both detection accuracy and model alignment with human judgment. These insights provide a foundation for enhancing LLM-based offensive language detection in real-world moderation tasks",

    "abstract": "Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enhance language models by integrating external multilingual information to produce context-aware responses. However, mRAG systems struggle with retrieving relevant information due to linguistic variations between queries and documents, generating inconsistent responses when multilingual sources conflict. In this work, we systematically investigate language preferences in both retrieval and generation of mRAG through a series of experiments. Our analysis indicates that retrievers tend to prefer high-resource and query languages, yet this preference does not consistently improve generation performance. Moreover, we observe that generators prefer the query language or Latin scripts, leading to inconsistent outputs. To overcome these issues, we propose Dual Knowledge Multilingual RAG (DKM-RAG), a simple yet effective framework that fuses translated multilingual passages with complementary model knowledge. Empirical results demonstrate that DKM-RAG mitigates language preference in generation and enhances performance across diverse linguistic settings.

Motivated by the remarkable success of the Feynman Technique in efficient human learning, we introduce Self-Tuning, a learning framework aimed at improving an LLM's ability to effectively acquire new knowledge from unseen raw documents through self-teaching. Specifically, we develop a Self-Teaching strategy that augments the documents with a set of knowledge-intensive tasks created in a self-supervised manner, focusing on three crucial aspects: memorization, comprehension, and self-reflection.

Unfortunately, LLMs face significant security and ethical risks. Although techniques such as safety alignment are developed for defense, prior researches reveal the possibility of bypassing such defenses through well-designed jailbreak attacks. In this paper, we propose QueryAttack, a novel framework to examine the generalizability of safety alignment. By treating LLMs as knowledge databases, we translate malicious queries in natural language into structured non-natural query language to bypass the safety alignment mechanisms of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream LLMs, and the results show that QueryAttack not only can achieve high attack success rates (ASRs), but also can jailbreak various defense methods. Furthermore, we tailor a defense method against QueryAttack, which can reduce ASR by up to 64% on GPT-4-1106. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/QueryAttack-334B",

Many recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of LLMs on simple arithmetic tasks (e.g., a+b, a× b), but how LLMs solve mixed arithmetic tasks still remains unexplored. This gap highlights the limitation of these findings in reflecting real-world scenarios. In this work, we take a step further to explore how LLMs compute mixed arithmetic expressions. We find that LLMs follow a similar workflow to mixed arithmetic calculations: first parsing the complete expression, then using attention heads to aggregate information to the last token position for result generation, without step-by-step reasoning at the token dimension. However, **for some specific expressions, the model generates the final result depends on the generation of intermediate results at the last token position, which is similar to human thinking.** Furthermore, we propose a **C**ausal **E**ffect **D**riven **F**ine-tuning method (CEDF) to adaptively enhance the identified key components used to execute mixed arithmetic calculations to improve LLMs reasoning ability",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "User profile embedded in the prompt template of personalized recommendation agents play a crucial role in shaping their decision-making process. High-quality user profiles are essential for aligning agent behavior with real user interests. Typically, these profiles are constructed by leveraging LLMs for user profile modeling (LLM-UM). However, this process faces several challenges: (1) LLMs struggle with long user behaviors due to context length limitations and performance degradation. (2) Existing methods often extract only partial segments from full historical behavior sequence, inevitably discarding diverse user interests embedded in the omitted content, leading to incomplete modeling and suboptimal profiling. (3) User profiling is often tightly coupled with the inference context, requiring online processing, which introduces significant latency overhead. In this paper, we propose PersonaX, an agent-agnostic LLM-UM framework to address these challenges. It augments downstream recommendation agents to achieve better recommendation performance and inference efficiency. PersonaX (a) segments complete historical behaviors into clustered groups, (b) selects multiple sub-behavior sequences (SBS) with a balance of prototypicality and diversity to form a high-quality core set, (c) performs offline multi-persona profiling to capture diverse user interests and generate fine-grained, cached textual personas, and (d) decouples user profiling from online inference, enabling profile retrieval instead of real-time generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness: using only 30–50% of behavioral data (sequence length 480), PersonaX enhances AgentCF by 3–11% and Agent4Rec by 10–50%. As a scalable and model-agnostic LLM-UM solution, PersonaX sets a new benchmark in scalable user modeling. The code is available at URL",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in alleviating hallucinations for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing automated evaluation metrics cannot fairly evaluate the outputs generated by RAG models during training and evaluation. LLM-based judgment models provide the potential to produce high-quality judgments, but they are highly sensitive to evaluation prompts, leading to inconsistencies when judging the output of RAG models. This paper introduces the Judge-Consistency (ConsJudge) method, which aims to enhance LLMs to generate more accurate evaluations for RAG models. Specifically, ConsJudge prompts LLMs to generate different judgments based on various combinations of judgment dimensions, utilizes the judge-consistency to evaluate these judgments, and selects the chosen and rejected judgments for DPO training. Our experiments show that ConsJudge can effectively provide more accurate judgments for optimizing RAG models across various RAG models and datasets. Further analysis reveals that judgments generated by ConsJudge have a high agreement with the superior LLM. All codes are available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ConsJudge",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly propelled the development of Conversational Recommendation Agents (CRAs). However, these agents often generate short-sighted responses that fail to sustain user guidance and meet expectations. Although preference optimization has proven effective in aligning LLMs with user expectations, it remains costly and performs poorly in multi-turn dialogue. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel multi-turn preference optimization (MTPO) paradigm **ECPO**, which leverages Expectation Confirmation Theory to explicitly model the evolution of user satisfaction throughout multi-turn dialogues, uncovering the underlying causes of dissatisfaction. These causes can be utilized to support targeted optimization of unsatisfactory responses, thereby achieving turn-level preference optimization. ECPO eliminates the significant sampling overhead of existing MTPO methods while ensuring the optimization process drives meaningful improvements. To support ECPO, we also introduce an LLM-based user simulator, **AILO**, to simulate user feedback and expectation confirmation during conversational recommendations. Experimental results show that ECPO significantly enhances CRA's interaction capabilities, offering notable improvements in both efficiency and effectiveness over existing MTPO methods",

    "volume": "findings",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches",

CipherBank comprises 2,358 meticulously crafted problems, covering 262 unique plaintexts across 5 domains and 14 subdomains, with a focus on privacy-sensitive and real-world scenarios that necessitate encryption. From a cryptographic perspective, CipherBank incorporates 3 major categories of encryption methods, spanning 9 distinct algorithms, ranging from classical ciphers to custom cryptographic techniques. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on CipherBank, e.g., GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and cutting-edge reasoning-focused models such as o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Our results reveal significant gaps in reasoning abilities not only between general-purpose chat LLMs and reasoning-focused LLMs but also in the performance of current reasoning-focused models when applied to classical cryptographic decryption tasks, highlighting the challenges these models face in understanding and manipulating encrypted data.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) risk retaining unauthorized or sensitive information from their training data, which raises privacy concerns. LLM unlearning seeks to mitigate these risks by selectively removing specified data while maintaining overall model performance. However, most existing work focuses on methods to achieve effective forgetting and does not provide a detailed analysis of the retain set, the portion of training data that is not targeted for removal. In this paper, we investigate the effects of unlearning on various subsets of the retain set through a case study on entity unlearning. We introduce the Syntactically Similar Neighbor Set, a group of queries that share similar syntactic structures with the data targeted for removal, and show that this subset suffers the greatest performance drop during unlearning. Moreover, when used for regularization, this set not only preserves performance on syntactically similar queries but also delivers comparable or improved results across other data subsets. Our results highlight that syntactic similarity is a critical factor, potentially more so than domain or entity relationships, in achieving effective and practical LLM unlearning",

To investigate RPAs' performance when faced with different types of conflicting requests, we develop an evaluation benchmark that includes contextual knowledge conflicting requests, parametric knowledge conflicting requests, and non-conflicting requests to assess RPAs' ability to identify conflicts and refuse to answer appropriately without over-refusing. Through extensive evaluation, we find that most RPAs behave significant performance gaps toward different conflict requests. To elucidate the reasons, we conduct an in-depth representation-level analysis of RPAs under various conflict scenarios. Our findings reveal the existence of rejection regions and direct response regions within the model's forwarding representation, and thus influence the RPA's final response behavior. Therefore, we introduce a lightweight representation editing approach that conveniently shifts conflicting requests to the rejection region, thereby enhancing the model's refusal accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we introduce LR2Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the Long-chain Reflective Reasoning capabilities of LLMs. LR2Bench comprises 850 samples across six Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) where reflective reasoning is crucial for deriving solutions that meet all given constraints. Each type of task focuses on distinct constraint patterns, such as knowledge-based, logical, and spatial constraints, providing a comprehensive evaluation of diverse problem-solving scenarios. We conduct extensive evaluation on both conventional models and o1-like models. Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced reasoning-specific models, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1-preview, struggle with tasks in LR2Bench, achieving an average Exact Match score of only 20.0% and 23.6%, respectively.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of text-attributed graph clustering, which aims to cluster each node into different groups using both textual attributes and structural information. Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to solve this problem, their performance is usually limited when uncertain nodes are near the cluster boundaries due to label scarcity. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance text-attributed graph clustering and develop a novel approach named Multi-agent Collaboration with Ranking Guidance (MARK). The core of our MARK is to generate reliable guidance using the collaboration of three LLM-based agents as ranking-based supervision signals. In particular, we first conduct the coarse graph clustering, and utilize a concept agent to induce the semantics of each cluster. Then, we infer the robustness under perturbations to identify uncertain nodes and use a generation agent to produce synthetic text that closely aligns with their topology. An inference agent is adopted to provide the ranking semantics for each uncertain node in comparison to its synthetic counterpart. The consistent feedback between uncertain and synthetic texts is identified as reliable guidance for fine-tuning the clustering model within a ranking-based supervision objective. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed MARK compared with competing baselines",

We construct LecSumm to verify whether language models truly capture human writing preferences, in which we recruit 200 college students to write summaries for lecture notes on ten different machine-learning topics and analyze writing preferences in real-world human summaries through the dimensions of length, content depth, tone & style, and summary format. We define the method of capturing human writing preferences by language models as finetuning pre-trained models with data and designing prompts to optimize the output of large language models. The results of translating the analyzed human writing preferences into prompts and conducting experiments show that both models still fail to capture human writing preferences effectively.

    "abstract": "Long-context language models (LCLMs) can process long context, but still exhibit position bias, also known as \"lost in the middle\", which indicates placing key information in the middle of the context will significantly affect performance. To mitigating this, we first explore the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. Then we identify that, in addition to position embeddings, positional information in hidden states also contributes to position bias, and it manifests itself in specific channels of hidden states, called positional hidden states. Based on these, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling positional hidden states. Experiments on NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval and LongBench, using various models including RoPE models, context window-extended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

    "abstract": "Applying Large Language Models (LLM) to solve math problems is one of the hottest research topics at present. Traditional Chain-of-Thought-based methods typically generate the reasoning path in a chain structure, leading to unnecessary interference caused by non-zero self-attention among weakly related reasoning steps. Such a setting also differs from humans' typical graph-structured reasoning habit (with an inter-step relationship graph in mind). To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel decoding method for Transformer-based LLM, named Self-attention-based Graph-of-Thought (SaGoT). SaGoT constructs a thought graph simultaneously as an LLM inference (based on a newly defined inter-step self-attention indicator), and generates reasoning steps with a novel graph-structured self-attention mechanism. It is a significant contribution for SaGoT to enable an LLM's graph-like reasoning ability by modifying its inner working operations, compared to SOTA prompting methods that are ex-post, rely on huge LLMs and redundant reasoning step generation to form a graph (inefficient & non-human-like). In addition, SaGoT is a training-free technique that can be seamlessly incorporated into pre-trained Transformer-based LLMs. Our experimental results have shown that SaGoT could significantly enhance mathematical reasoning accuracy without the reliance on huge computationally over-expensive LLMs. It also avoids SOTA methods' performance degradation issues when the LLM is too small to comprehend complex prompts. Moreover, SaGoT integrates intrinsic interpretability into the LLM's reasoning procedure, intuitively assisting humans in understanding how an LLM views the relationships among its reasoning steps, and why the LLM succeeds or fails",

To complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by planning.

However, this forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task goal in one step. Specifically, we design a backward reasoning based agent (BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust, consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state.

    "abstract": "Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating draft tokens for target model verification. Current approaches for obtaining draft tokens rely on lightweight draft models or additional model structures to generate draft tokens and retrieve context from databases. Due to the draft model's small size and limited training data, model-based speculative decoding frequently becomes less effective in out-of-domain scenarios. Additionally, the time cost of the drafting phase results in a low upper limit on acceptance length during the verification step, limiting overall efficiency. This paper proposes RASD (Retrieval-Augmented Speculative Decoding), which adopts retrieval methods to enhance model-based speculative decoding. We introduce tree pruning and tree fusion to achieve this. Specifically, we develop a pruning method based on the draft model's probability distribution to construct the optimal retrieval tree. Second, we employ the longest prefix matching algorithm to merge the tree generated by the draft model with the retrieval tree, resulting in a unified tree for verification. Experimental results demonstrate that RASD achieves state-of-the-art inference acceleration across tasks such as DocQA, Summary, Code, and In-Domain QA.

    "abstract": "To mitigate the hallucination and knowledge deficiency in large language models (LLMs), Knowledge Graph (KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promising potential by utilizing KGs as an external resource to enhance LLM reasoning.However, existing KG-RAG approaches struggle with a trade-off between flexibility and retrieval quality. Modular methods prioritize flexibility by avoiding the use of KG-fine-tuned models during retrieval, leading to fixed retrieval strategies and suboptimal retrieval quality. Conversely, coupled methods embed KG information within models to improve retrieval quality but at the expense of flexibility.In this paper, we propose a novel flexible modular KG-RAG framework, termed FRAG, which synergizes the advantages of both approaches. FRAG estimates the hop range of reasoning paths based solely on the query and classifies it as either simple or complex.To match the complexity of the query, tailored pipelines are applied to ensure efficient and accurate reasoning path retrieval, thus fostering the final reasoning process. By using the query text instead of the KG to infer the structural information of reasoning paths and employing adaptable retrieval strategies, FRAG improves retrieval quality while maintaining flexibility. Moreover, FRAG does not require extra LLM fine-tuning or calls, significantly boosting efficiency and conserving resources. Extensive experiments show that FRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency and low resource consumption.

We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence. The dataset and code are released at https://github.com/JackChen-seu/Reefknot",
