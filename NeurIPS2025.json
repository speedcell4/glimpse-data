    "title": "Generalized Linear Mode Connectivity for Transformers",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Understanding the geometry of neural network loss landscapes is a central question in deep learning, with implications for generalization and optimization. A striking phenomenon is $\\textit{linear mode connectivity}$ (LMC), where independently trained models can be connected by low- or zero-barrier paths, despite appearing to lie in separate loss basins. However, this is often obscured by symmetries in parameter space—such as neuron permutations—which make functionally equivalent models appear dissimilar. Prior work has predominantly focused on neuron reordering through permutations, but such approaches are limited in scope and fail to capture the richer symmetries exhibited by modern architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that captures four symmetry classes—permutations, semi-permutations, orthogonal transformations, and general invertible maps—broadening the set of valid reparameterizations and subsuming many previous approaches as special cases. Crucially, this generalization enables, for the first time, the discovery of low- and zero-barrier linear interpolation paths between independently trained Vision Transformers and GPT-2 models. Furthermore, our framework extends beyond pairwise alignment, to multi-model and width-heterogeneous settings, enabling alignment across architectures of different sizes. These results reveal deeper structure in the loss landscape and underscore the importance of symmetry-aware analysis for understanding model space geometry",

    "title": "Deep Compositional Phase Diffusion for Long Motion Sequence Generation",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips, resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used for node classification, yet their opaque decision-making limits trust and adoption. While local explanations offer insights into individual predictions, global explanation methods—those that characterize an entire class—remain underdeveloped. Existing global explainers rely on motif discovery in small graphs, an approach that breaks down in large, real-world settings where subgraph repetition is rare, node attributes are high-dimensional, and predictions arise from complex structure-attribute interactions. We propose GnnXemplar, a novel global explainer inspired from Exemplar Theory from cognitive science. GnnXemplar identifies representative nodes in the GNN embedding space—exemplars—and explains predictions using natural language rules derived from their neighborhoods. Exemplar selection is framed as a coverage maximization problem over reverse $k$-nearest neighbors, for which we provide an efficient greedy approximation. To derive interpretable rules, we employ a self-refining prompt strategy using large language models (LLMs). Experiments across diverse benchmarks show that GnnXemplar significantly outperforms existing methods in fidelity, scalability, and human interpretability, as validated by a user study with 60 participants",

    "abstract": "Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential across graph learning tasks but face significant challenges in knowledge updating and reasoning faithfulness. To address these issues, we introduce the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigm for GFMs, which leverages graph knowledge retrieval.

The task-aware retriever implements adaptive retrieval strategies for node, edge, and graph-level tasks to surface structurally and semantically relevant evidence. The graph fusion enhancement module fuses retrieved graph features with query features and augments the topology with sparse adjacency links that preserve structural and semantic proximity, yielding a fused graph for GFM inference.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We sharply characterize the optimal first-order query complexity of agnostic active learning for all concept classes, and propose a new general active learning algorithm which achieves it. Remarkably, the optimal query complexity admits a leading term which is always strictly smaller than the sample complexity of passive supervised learning (by a factor proportional to the best-in-class error rate). This was not previously known to be possible in the agnostic setting. For comparison, in all previous general analyses, the leading term exhibits an additional factor, such as the disagreement coefficient or related complexity measure, and therefore only provides improvements over passive learning in restricted cases. The present work completely removes such factors from the leading term, implying that $\\textit{every}$ concept class benefits from active learning in the non-realizable case.

Our study addresses this gap by providing the first polynomial-time learnability results (specifically strong, agnostic PAC learning) for single-layer Transformers with linear attention. We show that learning the optimal multi head linear attention can be recast as finding the optimal kernel predictor in a suitably defined RKHS. Moving to generalization, we construct an algorithm that, given a dataset, checks in polynomial time whether the set of best fit multi head linear attention networks on this data all perform an identical computation--a powerful notion for out of distribution generalization. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on several canonical tasks: learning random linear attention networks, key--value associations, and learning to execute finite automata.

We provide a comprehensive characterization of these robustness properties, including formal guarantees under reward and transition uncertainty, as well as settings where the method performs poorly. Much of our analysis contrasts state entropy with the widely used policy entropy regularization, highlighting their different benefits.

    "abstract": "Modern deep generative models can now produce high-quality synthetic samples that are often indistinguishable from real training data. A growing body of research aims to understand why recent methods, such as diffusion and flow matching techniques, generalize so effectively. Among the proposed explanations are the inductive biases of deep learning architectures and the stochastic nature of the conditional flow matching loss. In this work, we rule out the noisy nature of the loss as a key factor driving generalization in flow matching. First, we empirically show that in high-dimensional settings, the stochastic and closed-form versions of the flow matching loss yield nearly equivalent losses. Then, using state-of-the-art flow matching models on standard image datasets, we demonstrate that both variants achieve comparable statistical performance, with the surprising observation that using the closed-form can even improve performance",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\\tau_\\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\\tau_\\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit",

    "title": "Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Computational methods for learning to sample from the Boltzmann distribution—where the target distribution is known only up to an unnormalized energy function—have advanced significantly recently. Due to the lack of explicit target samples, however, prior diffusion-based methods, known as _diffusion samplers_, often require importance-weighted estimation or complicated learning processes. Both trade off scalability with extensive evaluations of the energy and model, thereby limiting their practical usage. In this work, we propose **Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Sampler (ASBS)**, a new diffusion sampler that employs simple and scalable matching-based objectives yet without the need to estimate target samples during training. ASBS is grounded on a mathematical model—the Schrödinger Bridge—which enhances sampling efficiency via kinetic-optimal transportation. Through a new lens of stochastic optimal control theory, we demonstrate how SB-based diffusion samplers can be learned at scale via Adjoint Matching and prove convergence to the global solution. Notably, ASBS generalizes the recent Adjoint Sampling (Havens et al., 2025) to arbitrary source distributions by relaxing the so-called memoryless condition that largely restricts the design space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ASBS on sampling from classical energy functions, amortized conformer generation, and molecular Boltzmann distributions.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

    "abstract": "We study the online calibration of multi-dimensional forecasts over an arbitrary convex set $\\mathcal{P} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ relative to an arbitrary norm $\\Vert\\cdot\\Vert$. We connect this with the problem of external regret minimization for online linear optimization, showing that if it is possible to guarantee $O(\\sqrt{\\rho T})$ worst-case regret after $T$ rounds when actions are drawn from $\\mathcal{P}$ and losses are drawn from the dual $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_*$ unit norm ball, then it is also possible to obtain $\\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \\exp(O(\\rho /\\epsilon^2))$ rounds. When $\\mathcal{P}$ is the $d$-dimensional simplex and $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$ is the $\\ell_1$-norm, the existence of $O(\\sqrt{T\\log d})$ algorithms for learning with experts implies that it is possible to obtain $\\epsilon$-calibrated forecasts after $T = \\exp(O(\\log{d}/\\epsilon^2)) = d^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$ rounds, recovering a recent result of Peng 2025. Interestingly, our algorithm obtains this guarantee without requiring access to any online linear optimization subroutine or knowledge of the optimal rate $\\rho$ -- in fact, our algorithm is identical for every setting of $\\mathcal{P}$ and $\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert$. Instead, we show that the optimal regularizer for the above OLO problem can be used to upper bound the above calibration error by a swap regret, which we then minimize by running the recent TreeSwap algorithm with Follow-The-Leader as a subroutine. The resulting algorithm is highly efficient and plays a distribution over simple averages of past observations in each round. Finally, we prove that any online calibration algorithm that guarantees $\\epsilon T$ $\\ell_1$-calibration error over the $d$-dimensional simplex requires $T \\geq \\exp(\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon))$ (assuming $d \\geq \\mathrm{poly}(1/\\epsilon)$).

Beyond robust performance, this choice affords new theoretical insights, highlights the \"secret sauce\" on top of signed momentum, and grants a precise statistical interpretation: we show that Adam in this setting implements a natural online algorithm for estimating the mean and variance of gradients—one that arises from a mean-field Gaussian variational inference perspective",

    "abstract": "Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for characterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems. The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in statistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap\" structure of statistical models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds---another foundational framework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI) models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry. In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the derivation of several known SQ lower bounds—such as for the NGCA model (Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024)—but also yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and convex truncation (De et al., 2023)",

    "title": "MaxSup: Overcoming Representation Collapse in Label Smoothing",

    "abstract": "Label Smoothing (LS) is widely adopted to reduce overconfidence in neural network predictions and improve generalization. Despite these benefits, recent studies reveal two critical issues with LS. First, LS induces overconfidence in misclassified samples. Second, it compacts feature representations into overly tight clusters, diluting intra-class diversity, although the precise cause of this phenomenon remained elusive. In this paper, we analytically decompose the LS-induced loss, exposing two key terms: (i) a regularization term that dampens overconfidence only when the prediction is correct, and (ii) an error-amplification term that arises under misclassifications. This latter term compels the network to reinforce incorrect predictions with undue certainty, exacerbating representation collapse. To address these shortcomings, we propose Max Suppression (MaxSup), which applies uniform regularization to both correct and incorrect predictions by penalizing the top-1 logit rather than the ground-truth logit. Through extensive feature-space analyses, we show that MaxSup restores intra-class variation and sharpens inter-class boundaries. Experiments on large-scale image classification and multiple downstream tasks confirm that MaxSup is a more robust alternative to LS.Code and reproducibility scripts are available at https://github.com/ZhouYuxuanYX/Maximum-Suppression-Regularization",

Our results reveal an intricate interplay between activation degrees and layer widths in achieving identifiability. As special cases, we show that architectures with non-increasing layer widths are generically identifiable under mild conditions, while encoder-decoder networks are identifiable when the decoder widths do not grow too rapidly compared to the activation degrees. Our proofs are constructive and center on a connection between deep PNNs and low-rank tensor decompositions, and Kruskal-type uniqueness theorems. We also settle an open conjecture on the dimension of PNN's neurovarieties, and provide new bounds on the activation degrees required for it to reach the expected dimension",

    "title": "Understanding and Mitigating Numerical Sources of Nondeterminism in LLM Inference",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have demonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise that benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that the reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system configuration, such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version, can introduce significant differences in the generated responses. This issue is especially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in early tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting accuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9\\% variation in accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences in GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this variability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under limited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic investigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM inference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware, software, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs diverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision—while critical for reproducibility—is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by this, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that stores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32, balancing memory efficiency with numerical stability.

    "title": "PRIMT: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Multimodal Feedback and Trajectory Synthesis from Foundation Models",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for teaching robots complex behaviors without reward engineering. However, its effectiveness is often limited by two critical challenges: the reliance on extensive human input and the inherent difficulties in resolving query ambiguity and credit assignment during reward learning. In this paper, we introduce PRIMT, a PbRL framework designed to overcome these challenges by leveraging foundation models (FMs) for multimodal synthetic feedback and trajectory synthesis. Unlike prior approaches that rely on single-modality FM evaluations, PRIMT employs a hierarchical neuro-symbolic fusion strategy, integrating the complementary strengths of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) in evaluating robot behaviors for more reliable and comprehensive feedback. PRIMT also incorporates foresight trajectory generation to warm-start the trajectory buffer with bootstrapped samples, reducing early-stage query ambiguity, and hindsight trajectory augmentation for counterfactual reasoning with a causal auxiliary loss to improve credit assignment. We evaluate PRIMT on 2 locomotion and 6 manipulation tasks on various benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance over FM-based and scripted baselines. Website at https://primt25.github.io/",

    "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) aim to decompose the activation space of large language models (LLMs) into human-interpretable latent directions or features. As we increase the number of features in the SAE, hierarchical features tend to split into finer features (\"math\" may split into \"algebra\", \"geometry\", etc.), a phenomenon referred to as feature splitting. However, we show that sparse decomposition and splitting of hierarchical features is not robust. Specifically, we show that seemingly monosemantic features fail to fire where they should, and instead get \"absorbed\" into their children features. We coin this phenomenon feature absorption, and show that it is caused by optimizing for sparsity in SAEs whenever the underlying features form a hierarchy. We introduce a metric to detect absorption in SAEs, and validate our findings empirically on hundreds of LLM SAEs. Our investigation suggests that varying SAE sizes or sparsity is insufficient to solve this issue. We discuss the implications of feature absorption in SAEs and some potential approaches to solve the fundamental theoretical issues before SAEs can be used for interpreting LLMs robustly and at scale",

    "abstract": "As the economic and environmental costs of training and deploying large vision or language models increase dramatically, analog in-memory computing (AIMC) emerges as a promising energy-efficient solution. However, the training perspective, especially its training dynamic, is underexplored. In AIMC hardware, the trainable weights are represented by the conductance of resistive elements and updated using consecutive electrical pulses. While the conductance changes by a constant in response to each pulse, in reality, the change is scaled by asymmetric and non-linear response functions, leading to a non-ideal training dynamic. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for gradient-based training on AIMC hardware with non-ideal response functions. We demonstrate that asymmetric response functions negatively impact Analog SGD by imposing an implicit penalty on the objective. To overcome the issue, we propose residual learning algorithm, which provably converges exactly to a critical point by solving a bilevel optimization problem. We show that the proposed method can be extended to deal with other hardware imperfections like limited response granularity. As far as we know, it is the first paper to investigate the impact of a class of generic non-ideal response functions. The conclusion is supported by simulations validating our theoretical insights",

More precisely, we consider signed graphs, where the edge signs indicate positive and negative interactions of node pairs, and our goal is to infer opinion intervals that are consistent with the edge signs. We introduce an optimization problem that models this question, and we give strong hardness results and a polynomial-time approximation scheme by utilizing connections to interval graphs and the Correlation Clustering problem. We further provide scalable heuristics and show that in experiments they yield more expressive solutions than Correlation Clustering baselines.

    "abstract": "Progress in offline reinforcement learning (RL) has been impeded by ambiguous problem definitions and entangled algorithmic designs, resulting in inconsistent implementations, insufficient ablations, and unfair evaluations. Although offline RL explicitly avoids environment interaction, prior methods frequently employ extensive, undocumented online evaluation for hyperparameter tuning, complicating method comparisons. Moreover, existing reference implementations differ significantly in boilerplate code, obscuring their core algorithmic contributions. We address these challenges by first introducing a rigorous taxonomy and a transparent evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies online tuning budgets. To resolve opaque algorithmic design, we provide clean, minimalistic, single-file implementations of various model-free and model-based offline RL methods, significantly enhancing clarity and achieving substantial speed-ups. Leveraging these streamlined implementations, we propose Unifloral, a unified algorithm that encapsulates diverse prior approaches and enables development within a single, comprehensive hyperparameter space. Using Unifloral with our rigorous evaluation protocol, we develop two novel algorithms - TD3-AWR (model-free) and MoBRAC (model-based) - which substantially outperform established baselines.

    "title": "Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast, captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\\| (A + E)_p - A_p \\|$, where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up to a factor of $\\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals, including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under diverse perturbation regimes",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated remarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces computational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation quality. We introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an architectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each layer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. By analyzing the distinct dynamics induced by this modification, we reveal a unique property we coin as *auto-compression*—the ability of a network to organically compress information during training with gradient descent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression, information is dynamically \"pushed\" into early layers during training, enhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in deeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise training patterns found only in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during training based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced noise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in low-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that generalize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to 18\\% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80\\% architectural compression while maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT architectures. These findings establish ACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that automatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while learning robust representations suitable for noisy real-world tasks and continual learning scenarios",

Inspired by our empirical observation, we argue that unimodal adaptation and cross-modal adaptation are two essential parts for the effective fine-tuning of MLLMs. From this perspective, we propose Multimodal Low-rank Adaptation (MokA), a multimodal-aware efficient fine-tuning strategy that takes multimodal characteristics into consideration. It compresses unimodal information by modality-specific parameters while explicitly enhancing cross-modal interaction, ensuring both unimodal and cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments cover three representative multimodal scenarios (audio-visual-text, visual-text, and speech-text), and multiple LLM backbones (LLaMA2, Qwen2, Qwen2.5-VL, etc). Consistent improvements indicate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method. Ablation studies and efficiency evaluation are also conducted to fully asses our method. Overall, we think MokA provides a more targeted solution for efficient adaptation of MLLMs, paving the way for further exploration",

However, we observe that the commonly used auxiliary load balancing loss often leads to expert overlap and overly uniform routing, which hinders expert specialization and degrades overall performance during post-training. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective solution that introduces two complementary objectives: (1) an orthogonality loss to encourage experts to process distinct types of tokens, and (2) a variance loss to encourage more discriminative routing decisions. Gradient-level analysis demonstrates that these objectives are compatible with the existing auxiliary loss and contribute to optimizing the training process. Experimental results over various model architectures and across multiple benchmarks show that our method significantly enhances expert specialization. Notably, our method improves classic MoE baselines with auxiliary loss by up to 23.79\\%, while also maintaining load balancing in downstream tasks, without any architectural modifications or additional components.

    "abstract": "Despite their recent progress, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle in knowledge-intensive tasks due to the limited and outdated parametric knowledge acquired during training. Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation addresses this issue by retrieving contextual knowledge from external databases, thereby enhancing MLLMs with expanded knowledge sources. However, existing MLLMs often fail to fully leverage the retrieved contextual knowledge for response generation. We examine representative MLLMs and identify two major causes, namely, attention bias toward different tokens and knowledge conflicts between parametric and contextual knowledge. To this end, we design Adaptive Logits Fusion and Attention Reallocation (ALFAR), a training-free and plug-and-play approach that improves MLLM responses by maximizing the utility of the retrieved knowledge. Specifically, ALFAR tackles the challenges from two perspectives. First, it alleviates attention bias by adaptively shifting attention from visual tokens to relevant context tokens according to query-context relevance. Second, it decouples and weights parametric and contextual knowledge at output logits, mitigating conflicts between the two types of knowledge. As a plug-and-play method, ALFAR achieves superior performance across diverse datasets without requiring additional training or external tools. Extensive experiments over multiple MLLMs and benchmarks show that ALFAR consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins.

Although traditional T3SR methods have made significant progress in capturing fine-grained associations, they implicitly assume that query descriptions are information-complete. In practical deployments, however, limited by the capabilities of users and models, it is difficult or even impossible to directly obtain a perfect textual query suiting the entire scene and model, thereby leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Interactive Text-3D Scene Retrieval Method (IDeal), which promotes the enhancement of the alignment between texts and 3D scenes through continuous interaction. To achieve this, we present an Interactive Retrieval Refinement framework (IRR), which employs a questioner to pose contextually relevant questions to an answerer in successive rounds that either promote detailed probing or encourage exploratory divergence within scenes. Upon the iterative responses received from the answerer, IRR adopts a retriever to perform both feature-level and semantic-level information fusion, facilitating scene-level interaction and understanding for more precise re-rankings. To bridge the domain gap between queries and interactive texts, we propose an Interaction Adaptation Tuning strategy (IAT).

To solve this issue, we deduce a concise JMMD based on the Representer theorem that avoids the tensor-product operator and obtains two essential findings. First, we reveal the uniformity of JMMD by proving that previous marginal, class conditional, and weighted class conditional probability distribution distances are three special cases of JMMD with different label reproducing kernels. Second, inspired by graph embedding, we observe that the similarity weights, which strengthen the intra-class compactness in the graph of Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), take opposite signs in the graph of JMMD, revealing why JMMD degrades the feature discrimination. This motivates us to propose a novel loss JMMD-HSIC by jointly considering JMMD and HSIC to promote discrimination of JMMD.

    "abstract": "We contribute towards resolving the open question of how many hidden layers are required in ReLU networks for exactly representing all continuous and piecewise linear functions on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. While the question has been resolved in special cases, the best known lower bound in general is still 2. We focus on neural networks that are compatible with certain polyhedral complexes, more precisely with the braid fan. For such neural networks, we prove a non-constant lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log\\log d)$ hidden layers required to exactly represent the maximum of $d$ numbers. Additionally, we provide a combinatorial proof that neural networks satisfying this assumption require three hidden layers to compute the maximum of 5 numbers; this had only been verified with an excessive computation so far. Finally, we show that a natural generalization of the best known upper bound to maxout networks is not tight, by demonstrating that a rank-3 maxout layer followed by a rank-2 maxout layer is sufficient to represent the maximum of 7 numbers",

Furthermore, we use our bounds to investigate the problem of data \"memorization\" raised in those works, and which asserts that there are learning problem instances for which any learning algorithm that has good prediction there exist distributions under which the algorithm must \"memorize'' a big fraction of the training dataset. We show that for every learning algorithm, there exists an auxiliary algorithm that does not memorize and which yields comparable generalization error for any data distribution.

    "abstract": "Online reinforcement learning (RL) excels in complex, safety-critical domains but suffers from sample inefficiency, training instability, and limited interpretability. Data attribution provides a principled way to trace model behavior back to training samples, yet existing methods assume fixed datasets, which is violated in online RL where each experience both updates the policy and shapes future data collection. In this paper, we initiate the study of data attribution for online RL, focusing on the widely used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We start by establishing a *local* attribution framework, interpreting model checkpoints with respect to the records in the recent training buffer. We design two target functions, capturing agent action and cumulative return respectively, and measure each record's contribution through gradient similarity between its training loss and these targets. We demonstrate the power of this framework through three concrete applications: diagnosis of learning, temporal analysis of behavior formation, and targeted intervention during training. Leveraging this framework, we further propose an algorithm, iterative influence-based filtering (IIF), for online RL training that iteratively performs experience filtering to refine policy updates. Across standard RL benchmarks (classic control, navigation, locomotion) to RLHF for large language models, IIF reduces sample complexity, speeds up training, and achieves higher returns. Together, these results open a new direction for making online RL more interpretable, efficient, and effective",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Computation in recurrent networks of neurons has been hypothesized to occur at the level of low-dimensional latent dynamics, both in artificial systems and in the brain. This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and spontaneous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging its warm-up period. We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning, we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a $\\times2.1$ improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques, including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most –200 points under the same conditions.

    "abstract": "Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class-wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task knowledge in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task-aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods",

We bridge these gaps by introducing a novel Encoder-Attender-Decoder (EAD) framework to systematically explore the space of task-optimized temporal neural networks trained on realistic tactile input sequences from a customized rodent whisker-array simulator. We identify convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNNs) as superior encoders to purely feedforward and state-space architectures for tactile categorization. Crucially, these ConvRNN-encoder-based EAD models achieve neural representations closely matching rodent somatosensory cortex, saturating the explainable neural variability and revealing a clear linear relationship between supervised categorization performance and neural alignment. Furthermore, contrastive self-supervised ConvRNN-encoder-based EADs, trained with tactile-specific augmentations, match supervised neural fits, serving as an ethologically-relevant, label-free proxy. For neuroscience, our findings highlight nonlinear recurrent processing as important for general-purpose tactile representations in somatosensory cortex, providing the first quantitative characterization of the underlying inductive biases in this system.

However, these additional components—combined with complex inference pipelines and heterogeneous workloads—introduce significant inference overhead. Therefore, efficiently serving MLLMs remains a major challenge. Current tightly coupled serving architectures struggle to distinguish between mixed request types or adapt parallelism strategies to different inference stages, leading to increased time-to-first-token (TTFT) and poor resource utilization. To address this, we introduce Elastic Multimodal Parallelism (EMP), a new serving paradigm that elastically adapts to resource heterogeneity across request types and inference stages. Building upon EMP, we develop ElasticMM, an MLLM serving system that (1) separates requests into independent modality groups with dynamic resource allocation via a modality-aware load balancer; (2) decouples inference stages and enables parallelism adjustment and adaptive scaling via elastic partition scheduling; and (3) improves inference efficiency through unified multimodal prefix caching and non-blocking encoding. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that ElasticMM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) serving systems, reducing TTFT by up to 4.2$\\times$ and achieving 3.2–4.5$\\times$ higher throughput while meeting service-level objectives (SLOs)",

    "abstract": "Gating mechanisms have been widely utilized, from early models like LSTMs and Highway Networks to recent state space models, linear attention, and also softmax attention. Yet, existing literature rarely examines the specific effects of gating. In this work, we conduct comprehensive experiments to systematically investigate gating-augmented softmax attention variants. Specifically, we perform a comprehensive comparison over 30 variants of 15B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models and 1.7B dense models trained on a 3.5 trillion token dataset. Our central finding is that a simple modification—applying a head-specific sigmoid gate after the Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA)—consistently improves performance. This modification also enhances training stability, tolerates larger learning rates, and improves scaling properties. By comparing various gating positions and computational variants, we attribute this effectiveness to two key factors: (1) introducing non-linearity upon the low-rank mapping in the softmax attention, and (2) applying query-dependent sparse gating scores to modulate the SDPA output. Notably, we find this sparse gating mechanism mitigates `massive activation`, `attention sink` and enhances long-context extrapolation performance. We also release related codes (https://github.com/qiuzh20/gated_attention}) and models (https://huggingface.co/QwQZh/gated_attention) to facilitate future research.

    "abstract": "The success of today's large language models (LLMs) depends on the observation that larger models perform better. However, the origin of this neural scaling law, that loss decreases as a power law with model size, remains unclear. We propose that representation superposition, meaning that LLMs represent more features than they have dimensions, can be a key contributor to loss and cause neural scaling. Based on Anthropic's toy model, we use weight decay to control the degree of superposition, allowing us to systematically study how loss scales with model size. When superposition is weak, the loss follows a power law only if data feature frequencies are power-law distributed. In contrast, under strong superposition, the loss generically scales inversely with model dimension across a broad class of frequency distributions, due to geometric overlaps between representation vectors. We confirmed that open-sourced LLMs operate in the strong superposition regime and have loss scaling inversely with model dimension, and that the Chinchilla scaling laws are also consistent with this behavior. Our results identify representation superposition as a central driver of neural scaling laws, providing insights into questions like when neural scaling laws can be improved and when they will break down",

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

This observation challenges classical views of non-convex optimization and has implications for model ensembling, generalization, and our understanding of neural loss geometry. Inspired by recent studies on LMC in standard neural networks, we systematically investigate this phenomenon within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures—a class of models known for their scalability and computational efficiency, which combine traditional neural networks—referred to as experts—through a learnable gating mechanism. We begin by conducting a comprehensive analysis of both dense and sparse gating regimes, demonstrating that the symmetries inherent to MoE architectures are fully characterized by permutations acting on both the expert components and the gating function. Building on these foundational findings, we propose a matching algorithm that enables alignment between independently trained MoEs, thereby facilitating the discovery of LMC. Finally, we empirically validate the presence of LMC using our proposed algorithm across diverse MoE configurations—including dense, sparse, and shared-expert variants—under a wide range of model settings and datasets of varying scales and modalities.

However, these models still encounter the following challenges when applied to real-world 3D navigation: 1) Insufficient understanding of 3D geometry and spatial semantics; 2) Limited capacity for large-scale exploration and long-term environmental memory; 3) Poor adaptability to dynamic and changing environments.To address these limitations, we propose Dynam3D, a dynamic layered 3D representation model that leverages language-aligned, generalizable, and hierarchical 3D representations as visual input to train 3D-VLM in navigation action prediction. Given posed RGB-D images, our Dynam3D projects 2D CLIP features into 3D space and constructs multi-level 3D patch-instance-zone representations for 3D geometric and semantic understanding with a dynamic and layer-wise update strategy. Our Dynam3D is capable of online encoding and localization of 3D instances, and dynamically updates them in changing environments to provide large-scale exploration and long-term memory capabilities for navigation. By leveraging large-scale 3D-language pretraining and task-specific adaptation, our Dynam3D sets new state-of-the-art performance on VLN benchmarks including R2R-CE, REVERIE-CE and NavRAG-CE under monocular settings. Furthermore, experiments for pre-exploration, lifelong memory, and real-world robot validate the effectiveness of practical deployment",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Equivariant neural networks are designed to respect symmetries through their architecture, boosting generalization and sample efficiency when those symmetries are present in the data distribution. Real-world data, however, often departs from perfect symmetry because of noise, structural variation, measurement bias, or other symmetry-breaking effects. Strictly equivariant models may struggle to fit the data, while unconstrained models lack a principled way to leverage partial symmetries. Even when the data is fully symmetric, enforcing equivariance can hurt training by limiting the model to a restricted region of the parameter space. Guided by homotopy principles, where an optimization problem is solved by gradually transforming a simpler problem into a complex one, we introduce Adaptive Constrained Equivariance (ACE), a constrained optimization approach that starts with a flexible, non-equivariant model and gradually reduces its deviation from equivariance. This gradual tightening smooths training early on and settles the model at a data-driven equilibrium, balancing between equivariance and non-equivariance. Across multiple architectures and tasks, our method consistently improves performance metrics, sample efficiency, and robustness to input perturbations compared with strictly equivariant models and heuristic equivariance relaxations",

SAGE initially leverages Large Language Models to construct a State-Action Graph, which is then multimodally refined using Vision-Language Models. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms baselines, generalizes effectively to unseen objects and actions in open-world settings.

    "title": "Does Reinforcement Learning Really Incentivize Reasoning Capacity in LLMs Beyond the Base Model?",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly in mathematics and programming tasks. It is widely believed that, similar to how traditional RL helps agents to explore and learn new strategies, RLVR enables LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities that exceed the capacity of the corresponding base models. In this study, we take a critical look at \\textit{the current state of RLVR} by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across diverse model families, RL algorithms, and math/coding/visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@\\textit{k} at large \\textit{k} values as the evaluation metric. While RLVR improves sampling efficiency towards the correct path, we surprisingly find that current training does \\emph{not} elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. We observe that while RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at smaller values of $k$ (\\eg, $k$=1), base models achieve higher pass@$k$ score when $k$ is large. Moreover, we observe that the reasoning capability boundary of LLMs often narrows as RLVR training progresses. Further coverage and perplexity analysis shows that the reasoning paths generated by RLVR models are already included in the base models' sampling distribution, suggesting that their reasoning abilities originate from and are \\textit{bounded} by the base model. From this perspective, treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in fully leveraging the potential of the base model. In contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Taken together, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not fully realized the potential of RL to elicit genuinely novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This underscores the need for improved RL paradigms—such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction—to unlock this potential",

They typically require extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as \\blg, which can optimize visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic space. \\alg employs learnable matrices with M\\\"{o}bius multiplication operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible yet efficient parametrization strategy.

We introduce SAVVY-Bench, the first benchmark for 3D spatial reasoning in dynamic scenes with synchronized spatial audio. SAVVY-Bench is comprised of thousands of carefully curated question–answer pairs probing both directional and distance relationships involving static and moving objects, and requires fine-grained temporal grounding, consistent 3D localization, and multi-modal annotation. To tackle this challenge, we propose SAVVY, a novel training-free reasoning pipeline that consists of two stages: (i) Egocentric Spatial Tracks Estimation, which leverages AV-LLMs as well as other audio-visual methods to track the trajectories of key objects related to the query using both visual and spatial audio cues, and (ii) Dynamic Global Map Construction, which aggregates multi-modal queried object trajectories and converts them into a unified global dynamic map. Using the constructed map, a final QA answer is obtained through a coordinate transformation that aligns the global map with the queried viewpoint.

    "abstract": "Designing model architectures requires decisions such as selecting operators (e.g., attention, convolution) and configurations (e.g., depth, width). However, evaluating the impact of these decisions on model quality requires costly pretraining, limiting architectural investigation. Inspired by how new software is built on existing code, we ask: can new architecture designs be studied using pretrained models? To this end, we present *grafting*, a simple approach for editing pretrained diffusion transformers (DiTs) to materialize new architectures under small compute budgets. Informed by our analysis of activation behavior and attention locality, we construct a testbed based on the DiT-XL/2 design to study the impact of grafting on model quality. Using this testbed, we develop a family of hybrid designs via grafting: replacing softmax attention with gated convolution, local attention, and linear attention, and replacing MLPs with variable expansion ratio and convolutional variants. Notably, many hybrid designs achieve good quality (FID: 2.38–2.64 vs. 2.27 for DiT-XL/2) using $<2$% pretraining compute. We then graft a text-to-image model (PixArt-$\\Sigma$), achieving a 1.43$\\times$ speedup with less than a 2% drop in GenEval score. Finally, we present a case study that restructures DiT-XL/2 by converting every pair of sequential transformer blocks into parallel blocks via grafting. This reduces model depth by 2$\\times$ and yields better quality (FID: 2.77) than other models of comparable depth. Together, we show that new diffusion model designs can be explored by grafting pretrained DiTs, with edits ranging from operator replacement to architecture restructuring.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning (MML) is significantly constrained by modality imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in practice. While existing approaches primarily focus on balancing the learning of different modalities to address this issue, they fundamentally overlook the inherent disproportion in model classification ability, which serves as the primary cause of this phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification ability of weak and strong modalities by incorporating the principle of boosting. Concretely, we first propose a sustained boosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the classification and residual errors. Subsequently, we introduce an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to dynamically facilitate the classification performance of the weak modality. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of the cross-modal gap function, ensuring the effectiveness of the proposed boosting scheme. To this end, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be balanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue.

    "abstract": "Vehicle GPS trajectories provide valuable movement information that supports various downstream tasks and applications. A desirable trajectory learning model should be able to transfer across regions and tasks without retraining, avoiding the need to maintain multiple specialized models and subpar performance with limited training data. However, each region has its unique spatial features and contexts, which are reflected in vehicle movement patterns and are difficult to generalize. Additionally, transferring across different tasks faces technical challenges due to the varying input-output structures required for each task. Existing efforts towards transferability primarily involve learning embedding vectors for trajectories, which perform poorly in region transfer and require retraining of prediction modules for task transfer. To address these challenges, we propose $\\textit{TransferTraj}$, a vehicle GPS trajectory learning model that excels in both region and task transferability. For region transferability, we introduce RTTE as the main learnable module within TransferTraj. It integrates spatial, temporal, POI, and road network modalities of trajectories to effectively manage variations in spatial context distribution across regions. It also introduces a TRIE module for incorporating relative information of spatial features and a spatial context MoE module for handling movement patterns in diverse contexts. For task transferability, we propose a task-transferable input-output scheme that unifies the input-output structure of different tasks into the masking and recovery of modalities and trajectory points. This approach allows TransferTraj to be pre-trained once and transferred to different tasks without retraining. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world vehicle trajectory datasets under various transfer settings, including task transfer, zero-shot region transfer, and few-shot region transfer.

While deep learning has made rapid advances in sparse-data reconstruction, existing methods generally omit optimization of sensor placements, leaving the mutual enhancement between reconstruction and placement on the shelf. To change this suboptimal practice, we propose PhySense, a synergistic two-stage framework that learns to jointly reconstruct physical fields and to optimize sensor placements, both aiming for accurate physics sensing. The first stage involves a flow-based generative model enhanced by cross-attention to adaptively fuse sparse observations. Leveraging the reconstruction feedback, the second stage performs sensor placement via projected gradient descent to satisfy spatial constraints. We further prove that the learning objectives of the two stages are consistent with classical variance-minimization principles, providing theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks, especially a 3D geometry dataset, indicate PhySense achieves state-of-the-art physics sensing accuracy and discovers informative sensor placements previously unconsidered.

However, whether logarithmic regret holds beyond small learning rates remains unclear. In this work, we take a step towards characterizing the regret *regimes* of SGB as a function of its learning rate. For two--armed bandits, we identify a sharp threshold, scaling with the sub-optimality gap $\\Delta$, below which SGB achieves *logarithmic* regret on all instances, and above which it can incur *polynomial* regret on some instances. This result highlights the necessity of knowing (or estimating) $\\Delta$ to ensure logarithmic regret with a constant learning rate. For general $K$-armed bandits, we further show the learning rate must scale inversely with $K$ to avoid polynomial regret. We introduce novel techniques to derive regret upper bounds for SGB, laying the groundwork for future advances in the theory of gradient-based bandit algorithms",

While techniques exist for such modification, they often require training data, are computationally expensive, or are architecture-specific. To address this, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global reconstruction error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term *Subset Fidelity*. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components via their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we use to propose **ModHiFi**, an algorithm for model modification that requires no training data or loss function access. **ModHiFi-P**, for structured pruning, achieves an 11% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. **ModHiFi-U**, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the structure of linear operators introduced in Hernandez et al. [2023] that decode specific relational facts in transformer language models. We extend their single-relation findings to a collection of relations and systematically chart their organization. We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific",

However, due to its iterative refinement process, the inference is often bottlenecked by slow and static sampling speed. To overcome this problem, we introduce `KL-Adaptive Stability Sampling' (KLASS), a fast yet effective sampling method that exploits token-level KL divergence to identify stable, high-confidence predictions. By unmasking multiple tokens in each iteration without any additional model training, our approach speeds up generation significantly while maintaining sample quality. On reasoning benchmarks, KLASS achieves up to $2.78\\times$ wall-clock speedups while improving performance over standard greedy decoding, attaining state-of-the-art results among diffusion-based samplers.

However, most existing model merging methods focus primarily on exploring the parameter space, merging models with identical architectures. Despite its potential, merging in the architecture space remains in its early stages due to the vast search space and challenges related to layer compatibility. This paper designs a hierarchical model merging framework named HM3, formulating a bilevel multi-objective model merging problem across both parameter and architecture spaces. At the parameter level, HM3 integrates existing merging methods to quickly identify optimal parameters. Based on these, an actor-critic strategy with efficient policy discretization is employed at the architecture level to explore inference paths with Markov property in the layer-granularity search space for reconstructing these optimal models. By training reusable policy and value networks, HM3 learns Pareto optimal models to provide customized solutions for various tasks.

    "title": "Structured Sparse Transition Matrices to Enable State Tracking in State-Space Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize structured transition matrices which enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity, as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA). While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity, they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost, even for moderate state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with provably optimal state size and depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, \\emph{PD-SSM}, parametrizes the transition matrix as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal matrix ($D$). As a result, the computational cost of parallel scans scales linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout of size $N ×N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On multivariate time-series classification, it outperforms neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded into sets of variable-length English sentences.

    "abstract": "Leveraging attention sparsity to accelerate long-context large language models (LLMs) has been of great importance recently. However, most existing sparse attention algorithms use a fixed budget of how many tokens to use in their computations. This simple static decision raises critical issues in real-world deployment because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios, where the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency can vary greatly. In this paper, we reveal a key insight that leveraging the idea of top-$p$ sampling (a.k.a., nucleus sampling) in sparse attention could enable efficient and adaptive budget decisions. Based on this, we propose Twilight, a framework that enhances any existing sparse attention algorithm with adaptive budget decision capabilities without sacrificing accuracy.

    "title": "An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs)—sources of treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome. However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based estimators, we introduce the concept of *IV-like (IVL)* regression for mitigating confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real data experiments to support our case",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Scientific discovery across diverse fields increasingly grapples with datasets exhibiting pathological long-tailed distributions: a few common phenomena overshadow a multitude of rare yet scientifically critical instances. Unlike standard benchmarks, these scientific datasets often feature extreme imbalance coupled with a modest number of classes and limited overall sample volume, rendering existing long-tailed recognition (LTR) techniques ineffective. Such methods, biased by majority classes or prone to overfitting on scarce tail data, frequently fail to identify the very instances—novel materials, rare disease biomarkers, faint astronomical signals—that drive scientific breakthroughs. This paper introduces a novel, end-to-end framework explicitly designed to address pathological long-tailed recognition in scientific contexts. Our approach synergizes a Balanced Supervised Contrastive Learning (B-SCL) mechanism, which enhances the representation of tail classes by dynamically re-weighting their contributions, with a Smooth Objective Regularization (SOR) strategy that manages the inherent tension between tail-class focus and overall classification performance. We introduce and analyze the real-world ZincFluor chemical dataset ($\\mathcal{T}=137.54$) and synthetic benchmarks with controllable extreme imbalances (CIFAR-LT variants). Extensive evaluations demonstrate our method's superior ability to decipher these extremes. Notably, on ZincFluor, our approach achieves a Tail Top-2 accuracy of $66.84\\%$, significantly outperforming existing techniques. On CIFAR-10-LT with an imbalance ratio of $1000$ ($\\mathcal{T}=100$), our method achieves a tail-class accuracy of $38.99\\%$, substantially leading the next best.

As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state–action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-72B achieves an average success rate of 45.0% on OSWorld‑Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of causal structure learning from a combination of observational and interventional data generated by a linear non-Gaussian structural equation model that might contain cycles. Recent results show that using mere observational data identifies the causal graph only up to a permutation-equivalence class. We obtain a combinatorial characterization of this class by showing that each equivalence class corresponds to a perfect matching in a bipartite graph. This bipartite representation allows us to analyze how interventions modify or constrain the matchings. Specifically, we show that each atomic intervention reveals one edge of the true matching and eliminates all incompatible causal graphs. Consequently, we formalize the optimal experiment design task as an adaptive stochastic optimization problem over the set of equivalence classes with a natural reward function that quantifies how many graphs are eliminated from the equivalence class by an intervention. We show that this reward function is adaptive submodular and provide a greedy policy with a provable near-optimal performance guarantee. A key technical challenge is to efficiently estimate the reward function without having to explicitly enumerate all the graphs in the equivalence class. We propose a sampling-based estimator using random matchings and analyze its bias and concentration behavior. Our simulation results show that performing a small number of interventions guided by our stochastic optimization framework recovers the true underlying causal structure",

Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we then show that nonlinear preconditioning—including gradient clipping—preserves the saddle point avoidance property of classical gradient descent. Crucially, the assumptions required for this analysis are actually satisfied in these applications, unlike in classical results that rely on restrictive Lipschitz smoothness conditions.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long chain-of-thought(CoT) ability in large language models(LLMs) typically requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few layers, greatly govern the long-form reasoning attributes, e.g. output length and self-reflection. Through simply amplifying these activations and adding ``wait'' tokens, the long CoT ability can be invoked without training, leading to significantly increased self-reflection rate and accuracy. In addition, we also find that the activation changes follow predictable trajectories, i.e. a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay. Based on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation control technique. It utilizes a few contrastive examples to identify the relevant activations, and then incorporates simple analytic functions to adjust their values at inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of our methods in efficiently eliciting the long CoT ability of LLMs and improving the performance. Besides, we further propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that trains only the last-layer activation amplification module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming LoRA on reasoning benchmarks with much fewer parameters.

In order to reduce the effect of data sparsity, researchers proposed contrastive learning methods to extract self-supervised signals from raw data. Contrastive learning methods address this problem by graph augmentation and maximizing the consistency of node representations between different augmented graphs. However, these methods tends to unintentionally distance the target node from its path nodes on the interaction path, thus limiting its effectiveness. In this regard, we propose a solution that uses paths as samples in the contrastive loss function. In order to obtain the path samples, we design a path sampling method. In addition to the contrast of the relationship between the target node and the nodes within the path (intra-path contrast), we also designed a method of contrasting the relationship between the paths (inter-path contrast) to better pull the target node and its path nodes closer to each other. We use Simplifying and Powering Graph Convolution Network (LightGCN) as the basis and combine with a new path-enhanced graph approach proposed for graph augmentation. It effectively improves the performance of recommendation models.

Despite the importance of speed and cost-effectiveness, prior works have utilized MLLMs as reward models, which poses significant constraints for real-world deployment. To address this, in this work, we propose the first process reward model (PRM) called Web-Shepherd which could assess web navigation trajectories in a step-level.

    "abstract": "Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) can perform multi-hop reasoning implicitly---producing correct answers without explicitly verbalizing intermediate steps---but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by training transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our analysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization, followed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution generalization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but accelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level exposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we introduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies semantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based representational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with the cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn provides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across training, linking representational structure to reasoning capability. These findings provide new insights into the interpretability of implicit multi-hop reasoning in LLMs, helping to clarify how complex reasoning processes unfold internally and offering pathways to enhance the transparency of such models",

This, in turn, increases the statistical cost, as reflected in known MOL bounds that depend on the complexity of $\\mathcal{G}$. We show that this cost is unavoidable for some losses, even in an idealized semi-supervised setting, where the learner has access to the Bayes-optimal solutions for the individual tasks as well as the marginal distributions over the covariates. On the other hand, for objectives defined with Bregman losses, we prove that the complexity of $\\mathcal{G}$ may come into play only in terms of unlabeled data. Concretely, we establish sample complexity upper bounds, showing precisely when and how unlabeled data can significantly alleviate the need for labeled data. This is achieved by a simple pseudo-labeling algorithm",

    "abstract": "The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, particularly following the release of DeepSeek-R1, which has inspired a surge of research into data quality and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite the pivotal role diversity plays in RL, its influence on LLM reasoning remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work presents a systematic investigation into the impact of diversity in RL-based training for LLM reasoning, and proposes a novel diversity-aware policy optimization method. Across evaluations on 12 LLMs, we observe a strong positive correlation between the solution diversity and potential@k (a novel metric quantifying an LLM's reasoning potential) in high-performing models. This finding motivates our method to explicitly promote diversity during RL training. Specifically, we design a token-level diversity and reformulate it into a practical objective, then we selectively apply it to positive samples. Integrated into the R1-zero training framework, our method achieves a 3.5\\% average improvement across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks, while generating more diverse and robust solutions",

This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios.

Although deep learning-based approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the prevailing \"long-sequence information gain hypothesis\" exhibits inherent limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations) during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning while significantly improving model performance.

    "abstract": "Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce. Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization. The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across four challenging tasks.

Subsequently, guided by the high-level image and text representations in the latent space of the pre-trained VLMs, the corrupted natural features are restored while inheriting the superior generalization capability.

We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality.

Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning algorithms commonly sample multiple ($n>1$) solution attempts for each problem and reward them independently. This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes individual sample performance over the diversity and collective utility of a set of samples. Such algorithms under-utilize the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-$k$ Policy Optimization (PKPO), a multivariate transformation on batches of rewards which leads to direct optimization of \\passk\\ performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that feature a large maximum reward when considered jointly. Our primary contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for the pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show that optimizing with these estimators reduces to reinforcement learning with (batches of) rewards that have been jointly transformed by a function that is stable and efficient to compute. While previous efforts propose transformations for $k=n$, our transformations are the first to enable robust optimization of the pass@k for any arbitrary $k \\leq n$. Rather than simply trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing $k$ during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 performance alongside significant pass@k gains. We validate our transformations on illustrative toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source models Gemma and Llama . We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target $k$. Furthermore, higher $k$ values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing $k$ boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k. Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely by improving exploration through the prioritization of joint utility over the utility of individual samples",

However, existing methods often rely on predefined templates for logical reasoning data generation, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios. To address the limitation, we propose **LogicTree**, a novel framework for efficiently synthesizing multi-step logical reasoning dataset that excels in both complexity and instantiation. By iteratively searching for applicable logic rules based on structural pattern matching to perform backward deduction, **LogicTree** constructs multi-step logic trees that capture complex reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we employ a two-stage LLM-based approach to instantiate various real-world scenarios for each logic tree, generating consistent real-world reasoning processes that carry contextual significance. This helps LLMs develop generalizable logical reasoning abilities across diverse scenarios rather than merely memorizing templates.

In this work, we challenge the dominance of AR-based approaches by introducing FUDOKI, a unified multimodal model purely based on discrete flow matching, as an alternative to conventional AR paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths with kinetic optimal velocities, our framework goes beyond the previous masking-based corruption process, enabling iterative refinement with self-correction capability and richer bidirectional context integration during generation. To mitigate the high cost of training from scratch, we initialize FUDOKI from pre-trained AR-based MLLMs and adaptively transition to the discrete flow matching paradigm. Experimental results show that FUDOKI achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art AR-based MLLMs across both visual understanding and image generation tasks, highlighting its potential as a foundation for next-generation unified multimodal models.

    "abstract": "Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates than existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. A key challenge is generalization to rare pathologies or different populations, noted in multiple studies, with fine-tuning on target populations suggested for improvement. However, current approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and under-resourced areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID) for high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates output quality with a compressibility-based approach while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show CUPID achieves similar quality to established PD-DL training that requires k-space data while outperforming compressed sensing (CS) and diffusion-based generative methods. We further demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide broader access to fast MRI for remote and rural populations in an attempt to reduce the obstacles associated with this expensive imaging modality.

    "abstract": "Vision-language-action (VLA) models provide a powerful approach to training control policies for physical systems, such as robots, by combining end-to-end learning with transfer of semantic knowledge from web-scale vision-language model (VLM) training. However, the constraints of real-time control are often at odds with the design of VLMs: the most powerful VLMs have tens or hundreds of billions of parameters, presenting an obstacle to real-time inference, and operate on discrete tokens rather than the continuous-valued outputs that are required for controlling robots. To address this challenge, recent VLA models have used specialized modules for efficient continuous control, such as action experts or continuous output heads, which typically require adding new untrained parameters to the pretrained VLM backbone. While these modules improve real-time and control capabilities, it remains an open question whether they preserve or degrade the semantic knowledge contained in the pretrained VLM, and what effect they have on the VLA training dynamics. In this paper, we study this question in the context of VLAs that include a continuous diffusion or flow matching action expert, showing that naively including such experts significantly harms both training speed and knowledge transfer. We provide an extensive analysis of various design choices, their impact on performance and knowledge transfer, and propose a technique for insulating the VLM backbone during VLA training that mitigates this issue.

Traditional supervised approaches often necessitate complete point clouds for training supervision, which are not readily accessible in real-world applications. Recent studies have attempted to mitigate this dependency by employing self-supervise mechanisms. However, these approaches frequently yield suboptimal results due to the absence of complete structure in the point cloud data during training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an effective framework to complete the point cloud under the guidance of self learned complete structure. A key contribution of our work is the development of a novel self-supervised complete structure reconstruction module, which can learn the complete structure explicitly from incomplete point clouds and thus eliminate the reliance on training data from complete point clouds. Additionally, we introduce a contrastive learning approach at both the cluster- and instance-level to extract shape features guided by the complete structure and to capture style features, respectively. This dual-level learning design ensures that the generated point clouds are both shape-completed and detail-preserving.

For instance, metrics like PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality), STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility), and MOS (Mean Opinion Score) each capture different aspects of speech quality. However, these metrics often have different scales, assumptions, and dependencies, making joint estimation non-trivial. To address these issues, we introduce ARECHO (Autoregressive Evaluation via Chain-based Hypothesis Optimization), a chain-based, versatile evaluation system for speech assessment grounded in autoregressive dependency modeling. ARECHO is distinguished by three key innovations: (1) a comprehensive speech information tokenization pipeline; (2) a dynamic classifier chain that explicitly captures inter-metric dependencies; and (3) a two-step confidence-oriented decoding algorithm that enhances inference reliability. Experiments demonstrate that ARECHO significantly outperforms the baseline framework across diverse evaluation scenarios, including enhanced speech analysis, speech generation evaluation, and noisy speech evaluation. Furthermore, its dynamic dependency modeling improves interpretability by capturing inter-metric relationships. Across tasks, ARECHO offers reference-free evaluation using its dynamic classifier chain to support subset queries (single or multiple metrics) and reduces error propagation via confidence-oriented decoding",

    "title": "Projective Equivariant Networks via Second-order Fundamental Differential Invariants",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Equivariant networks enhance model efficiency and generalization by embedding symmetry priors into their architectures. However, most existing methods, primarily based on group convolutions and steerable convolutions, face significant limitations when dealing with complex transformation groups, particularly the projective group, which plays a crucial role in vision. In this work, we tackle the challenge by constructing projective equivariant networks based on differential invariants. Using the moving frame method with a carefully selected cross section tailored for multi-dimensional functions, we derive a complete and concise set of second-order fundamental differential invariants of the projective group. We provide a rigorous analysis of the properties and transformation relationships of their underlying components, yielding a further simplified and unified set of fundamental differential invariants, which facilitates both theoretical analysis and practical applications. Building on this foundation, we develop the first deep projective equivariant networks, PDINet, which achieve full projective equivariance without discretizing or sampling the group. Empirical results on the projectively transformed STL-10 and Imagenette datasets show that PDINet achieves improvements of 11.39\\% and 5.66\\% in accuracy over the respective standard baselines under out-of-distribution settings, demonstrating its strong generalization to complex geometric transformations",

    "abstract": "Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks",

    "title": "Blameless Users in a Clean Room: Defining Copyright Protection for Generative Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Are there any conditions under which a generative model's outputs are guaranteed not to infringe the copyrights of its training data? This is the question of \"provable copyright protection\" first posed by Vyas, Kakade, and Barak [ICML 2023]. They define _near access-freeness (NAF)_ and propose it as sufficient for protection. This paper revisits the question and establishes new foundations for provable copyright protection---foundations that are firmer both technically and legally. First, we show that NAF alone does not prevent infringement. In fact, NAF models can enable verbatim copying, a blatant failure of copy protection that we dub being _tainted_. Then, we introduce our _blameless copy protection framework_ for defining meaningful guarantees, and instantiate it with _clean-room copy protection_. Clean-room copy protection allows a user to control their risk of copying by behaving in a way that is unlikely to copy in a counterfactual \"clean-room setting.\" Finally, we formalize a common intuition about differential privacy and copyright by proving that DP implies clean-room copy protection when the dataset is _golden_, a copyright deduplication requirement",

    "title": "Adaptive 3D Reconstruction via Diffusion Priors and Forward Curvature-Matching Likelihood Updates",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Reconstructing high-quality point clouds from images remains challenging in computer vision. Existing generative models, particularly diffusion models, based approaches that directly learn the posterior may suffer from inflexibility—they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution—all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

    "title": "From Shortcut to Induction Head: How Data Diversity Shapes Algorithm Selection in Transformers",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Transformers can implement both generalizable algorithms (e.g., induction heads) and simple positional shortcuts (e.g., memorizing fixed output positions). In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low \"max-sum\" ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors",

We investigate evolutionary algorithms for synthesizing nontrivial interestingness measures. In particular, we introduce an LLM-based evolutionary algorithm that features function abstraction, leading to notable improvements in discovering elementary number theory and finite fields over hard-coded baselines.
