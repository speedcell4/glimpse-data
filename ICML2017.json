    "title": "Uncovering Causality from Multivariate Hawkes Integrated Cumulants",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We design a new nonparametric method that allows one to estimate the matrix of integrated kernels of a multivariate Hawkes process. This matrix not only encodes the mutual influences of each node of the process, but also disentangles the causality relationships between them. Our approach is the first that leads to an estimation of this matrix without any parametric modeling and estimation of the kernels themselves. A consequence is that it can give an estimation of causality relationships between nodes (or users), based on their activity timestamps (on a social network for instance), without knowing or estimating the shape of the activities lifetime. For that purpose, we introduce a moment matching method that fits the second-order and the third-order integrated cumulants of the process. A theoretical analysis allows to prove that this new estimation technique is consistent. Moreover, we show on numerical experiments that our approach is indeed very robust to the shape of the kernels, and gives appealing results on the MemeTracker database and on financial order book data",

    "title": "Constrained Policy Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For many applications of reinforcement learning it can be more convenient to specify both a reward function and constraints, rather than trying to design behavior through the reward function. For example, systems that physically interact with or around humans should satisfy safety constraints. Recent advances in policy search algorithms (Mnih et al., 2016, Schulman et al., 2015, Lillicrap et al., 2016, Levine et al., 2016) have enabled new capabilities in high-dimensional control, but do not consider the constrained setting. We propose Constrained Policy Optimization (CPO), the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for constrained reinforcement learning with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. Our method allows us to train neural network policies for high-dimensional control while making guarantees about policy behavior all throughout training. Our guarantees are based on a new theoretical result, which is of independent interest: we prove a bound relating the expected returns of two policies to an average divergence between them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on simulated robot locomotion tasks where the agent must satisfy constraints motivated by safety",

The proposed information-theoretic update of the search distribution results in a Bayesian interpretation of local stochastic search: the search distribution encodes prior knowledge on the optimum's location and is weighted at each iteration by the likelihood of this location's optimality.

To allow for accurate prognosis of deteriorating patients, we develop a novel continuous-time probabilistic model for a monitored patient's temporal sequence of physiological data. Our model captures \"informatively sampled\" patient episodes: the clinicians' decisions on when to observe a hospitalized patient's vital signs and lab tests over time are represented by a marked Hawkes process, with intensity parameters that are modulated by the patient's latent clinical states, and with observable physiological data (mark process) modeled as a switching multi-task Gaussian process. In addition, our model captures \"informatively censored\" patient episodes by representing the patient's latent clinical states as an absorbing semi-Markov jump process. The model parameters are learned from offline patient episodes in the electronic health records via an EM-based algorithm.

The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures",

Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor–critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals.

    "title": "Oracle Complexity of Second-Order Methods for Finite-Sum Problems",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Finite-sum optimization problems are ubiquitous in machine learning, and are commonly solved using first-order methods which rely on gradient computations. Recently, there has been growing interest in second-order methods, which rely on both gradients and Hessians. In principle, second-order methods can require much fewer iterations than first-order methods, and hold the promise for more efficient algorithms. Although computing and manipulating Hessians is prohibitive for high-dimensional problems in general, the Hessians of individual functions in finite-sum problems can often be efficiently computed, e.g. because they possess a low-rank structure. Can second-order information indeed be used to solve such problems more efficiently? In this paper, we provide evidence that the answer – perhaps surprisingly – is negative, at least in terms of worst-case guarantees. However, we also discuss what additional assumptions and algorithmic approaches might potentially circumvent this negative result",

In sequential decision making, softmax is often used in settings where it is necessary to maximize utility but also to hedge against problems that arise from putting all of one's weight behind a single maximum utility decision. The Boltzmann softmax operator is the most commonly used softmax operator in this setting, but we show that this operator is prone to misbehavior. In this work, we study a differentiable softmax operator that, among other properties, is a non-expansion ensuring a convergent behavior in learning and planning.

We propose a structure estimation method that maximizes the l1-regularized marginal pseudolikelihood of the observed data. Our analysis shows that the amount of unlabeled data required to identify the true structure scales sublinearly in the number of possible dependencies for a broad class of models. Simulations show that our method is 100x faster than a maximum likelihood approach and selects 1/4 as many extraneous dependencies.

The standard remedy is to use the k-Means|| algorithm which reduces the number of sequential rounds and is thus suitable for a distributed setting. In this paper, we provide a novel analysis of the k-Means|| algorithm that bounds the expected solution quality for any number of rounds and oversampling factors greater than k, the two parameters one needs to choose in practice. In particular, we show that k-Means|| provides provably good clusterings even for a small, constant number of iterations. This theoretical finding explains the common observation that k-Means|| performs extremely well in practice even if the number of rounds is low. We further provide a hard instance that shows that an additive error term as encountered in our analysis is inevitable if less than k-1 rounds are employed",

The paper shows that that gradient descent converges to a Nash equilibrium in safe games. The main contribution is to define strongly-typed agents and show they are guaranteed to interact safely, thereby providing sufficient conditions to guarantee safe interactions.

Although, the problem has largely been overcome via carefully constructed initializations and batch normalization, architectures incorporating skip-connections such as highway and resnets perform much better than standard feedforward architectures despite well-chosen initialization and batch normalization. In this paper, we identify the shattered gradients problem. Specifically, we show that the correlation between gradients in standard feedforward networks decays exponentially with depth resulting in gradients that resemble white noise whereas, in contrast, the gradients in architectures with skip-connections are far more resistant to shattering, decaying sublinearly. Detailed empirical evidence is presented in support of the analysis, on both fully-connected networks and convnets.

    "abstract": "We consider structure discovery of undirected graphical models from observational data. Inferring likely structures from few examples is a complex task often requiring the formulation of priors and sophisticated inference procedures. Popular methods rely on estimating a penalized maximum likelihood of the precision matrix. However, in these approaches structure recovery is an indirect consequence of the data-fit term, the penalty can be difficult to adapt for domain-specific knowledge, and the inference is computationally demanding. By contrast, it may be easier to generate training samples of data that arise from graphs with the desired structure properties. We propose here to leverage this latter source of information as training data to learn a function, parametrized by a neural network, that maps empirical covariance matrices to estimated graph structures. Learning this function brings two benefits: it implicitly models the desired structure or sparsity properties to form suitable priors, and it can be tailored to the specific problem of edge structure discovery, rather than maximizing data likelihood. Applying this framework, we find our learnable graph-discovery method trained on synthetic data generalizes well: identifying relevant edges in both synthetic and real data, completely unknown at training time. We find that on genetics, brain imaging, and simulation data we obtain performance generally superior to analytical methods",

We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in approximate reinforcement learning.

A naive learning algorithm that uses the noisy sufficient statistics \"as is\" outperforms general-purpose differentially private learning algorithms. However, it has three limitations: it ignores knowledge about the data generating process, rests on uncertain theoretical foundations, and exhibits certain pathologies.

We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by a combination of the (generalized) curvature $\\alpha$ and the submodularity ratio $\\gamma$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1- e^{-\\gamma\\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization.

Rather than attempting to redesign or approximate existing networks, we propose two schemes that adaptively utilize networks. We first pose an adaptive network evaluation scheme, where we learn a system to adaptively choose the components of a deep network to be evaluated for each example. By allowing examples correctly classified using early layers of the system to exit, we avoid the computational time associated with full evaluation of the network. We extend this to learn a network selection system that adaptively selects the network to be evaluated for each example. We show that computational time can be dramatically reduced by exploiting the fact that many examples can be correctly classified using relatively efficient networks and that complex, computationally costly networks are only necessary for a small fraction of examples. We pose a global objective for learning an adaptive early exit or network selection policy and solve it by reducing the policy learning problem to a layer-by-layer weighted binary classification problem. Empirically, these approaches yield dramatic reductions in computational cost, with up to a 2.8x speedup on state-of-the-art networks from the ImageNet image recognition challenge with minimal ($<1\\%$) loss of top5 accuracy",

We prove that when using CFR in zero-sum games, adding BRP will asymptotically prune any action that is not part of a best response to some Nash equilibrium. This leads to provably faster convergence and lower space requirements. Experiments show that BRP results in a factor of 7 reduction in space, and the reduction factor increases with game size",

The key question is then under what conditions can one prove that optimization will succeed. Here we provide a strong result of this kind.

For this architecture we show that learning is NP-complete in the general case, but that when the input distribution is Gaussian, gradient descent converges to the global optimum in polynomial time.

First-order KOCO methods such as functional gradient descent require only $O(t)$ time and space per iteration, and, when the only information on the losses is their convexity, achieve a minimax optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Nonetheless, many common losses in kernel problems, such as squared loss, logistic loss, and squared hinge loss posses stronger curvature that can be exploited. In this case, second-order KOCO methods achieve $O(\\log(\\mathrm{Det}(K)))$ regret, which we show scales as $O(deff \\log T)$, where $deff$ is the effective dimension of the problem and is usually much smaller than $O(\\sqrt{T})$.

In this paper, we introduce kernel online Newton step (KONS), a new second-order KOCO method that also achieves $O(deff\\log T)$ regret.

To incorporate PDs in a learning pipeline, several kernels have been proposed for PDs with a strong emphasis on the stability of the RKHS distance w.r.t. perturbations of the PDs.

Given multiple experts' inputs, most existing approaches can only discover one clustering structure. However, data is multi-faced by nature and can be clustered in different ways (also known as views). In an exploratory analysis problem where ground truth is not known, different experts may have diverse views on how to cluster data. In this paper, we address the problem on how to automatically discover multiple ways to cluster data given potentially diverse inputs from multiple uncertain experts. We propose a novel Bayesian probabilistic model that automatically learns the multiple expert views and the clustering structure associated with each view. The benefits of learning the experts' views include 1) enabling the discovery of multiple diverse clustering structures, and 2) improving the quality of clustering solution in each view by assigning higher weights to experts with higher confidence. In our approach, the expert views, multiple clustering structures and expert confidences are jointly learned via variational inference.

First, we introduce a novel asymptotically unbiased Granger causality estimator with corresponding test statistics and confidence intervals to allow, for the first time, uncertainty characterization in high-dimensional Granger causal inference.

However, many evidences have corroborated that heuristic nonconvex approaches also have good empirical computational performance and convergence to the global optima, although there is a lack of theoretical justification. Such a gap between theory and practice motivates us to study a nonconvex formulation for multiview representation learning, which can be efficiently solved by a simple stochastic gradient descent method. By analyzing the dynamics of the algorithm based on diffusion processes, we establish a global rate of convergence to the global optima. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory",

    "abstract": "While crowdsourcing has been a cost and time efficient method to label massive samples, one critical issue is quality control, for which the key challenge is to infer the ground truth from noisy or even adversarial data by various users. A large class of crowdsourcing problems, such as those involving age, grade, level, or stage, have an ordinal structure in their labels. Based on a technique of sampling estimated label from the posterior distribution, we define a novel separating width among the labeled observations to characterize the quality of sampled labels, and develop an efficient algorithm to optimize it through solving multiple linear decision boundaries and adjusting prior distributions. Our algorithm is empirically evaluated on several real world datasets, and demonstrates its supremacy over state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of Robust Matrix Completion (RMC) where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix by observing a small number of its entries out of which a few can be arbitrarily corrupted. We propose a simple projected gradient descent-based method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations while tolerating a nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods",

    "abstract": "Convolution is a critical component in modern deep neural networks, thus several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is simple but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect methods have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based convolution, or Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods have high memory overhead, which creates performance degradation and offers a poor trade-off between performance and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process. MEC lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact way (i.e., much less memory overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications in parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory footprint improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our experimental results show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms, compared with other indirect convolution algorithms",

However, in real-world control problems, the actions one can take are bounded by physical constraints, which introduces a bias when the standard Gaussian distribution is used as the stochastic policy. In this work, we propose to use the Beta distribution as an alternative and analyze the bias and variance of the policy gradients of both policies. We show that the Beta policy is bias-free and provides significantly faster convergence and higher scores over the Gaussian policy when both are used with trust region policy optimization (TRPO) and actor critic with experience replay (ACER), the state-of-the-art on- and off-policy stochastic methods respectively, on OpenAI Gym's and MuJoCo's continuous control environments",

The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art regarding accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples.

    "abstract": "We propose in this paper a differentiable learning loss between time series, building upon the celebrated dynamic time warping (DTW) discrepancy. Unlike the Euclidean distance, DTW can compare time series of variable size and is robust to shifts or dilatations across the time dimension. To compute DTW, one typically solves a minimal-cost alignment problem between two time series using dynamic programming. Our work takes advantage of a smoothed formulation of DTW, called soft-DTW, that computes the soft-minimum of all alignment costs. We show in this paper that soft-DTW is a differentiable loss function, and that both its value and gradient can be computed with quadratic time/space complexity (DTW has quadratic time but linear space complexity). We show that this regularization is particularly well suited to average and cluster time series under the DTW geometry, a task for which our proposal significantly outperforms existing baselines (Petitjean et al., 2011). Next, we propose to tune the parameters of a machine that outputs time series by minimizing its fit with ground-truth labels in a soft-DTW sense.

    "abstract": "When training neural networks, the use of Synthetic Gradients (SG) allows layers or modules to be trained without update locking – without waiting for a true error gradient to be backpropagated – resulting in Decoupled Neural Interfaces (DNIs). This unlocked ability of being able to update parts of a neural network asynchronously and with only local information was demonstrated to work empirically in Jaderberg et al (2016). However, there has been very little demonstration of what changes DNIs and SGs impose from a functional, representational, and learning dynamics point of view. In this paper, we study DNIs through the use of synthetic gradients on feed-forward networks to better understand their behaviour and elucidate their effect on optimisation. We show that the incorporation of SGs does not affect the representational strength of the learning system for a neural network, and prove the convergence of the learning system for linear and deep linear models. On practical problems we investigate the mechanism by which synthetic gradient estimators approximate the true loss, and, surprisingly, how that leads to drastically different layer-wise representations. Finally, we also expose the relationship of using synthetic gradients to other error approximation techniques and find a unifying language for discussion and comparison",

Temporal latent state models are therefore attractive, and so we adopt the continuous time hidden Markov model (CT-HMM) due to its ability to describe irregular arrival times of event data. Standard CT-HMMs, however, are not specialized for predicting the time to a future event, the key variable for mHealth interventions. Also, standard emission models lack a sufficiently rich structure to describe multimodal data and incorporate domain knowledge. We present iSurvive, an extension of classical survival analysis to a CT-HMM. We present a parameter learning method for GLM emissions and survival model fitting, and present promising results on both synthetic data and an mHealth drug use dataset",

Our approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR systems by a large margin on in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also performs well on out-of-domain handwritten data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The problem of automatically generating a computer program from some specification has been studied since the early days of AI. Recently, two competing approaches for `automatic program learning' have received significant attention: (1) `neural program synthesis', where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) `neural program induction', where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation. Here, for the first time, we directly compare both approaches on a large-scale, real-world learning task and we additionally contrast to rule-based program synthesis, which uses hand-crafted semantics to guide the program generation. Our neural models use a modified attention RNN to allow encoding of variable-sized sets of I/O pairs, which achieve 92\\% accuracy on a real-world test set, compared to the 34\\% accuracy of the previous best neural synthesis approach. The synthesis model also outperforms a comparable induction model on this task, but we more importantly demonstrate that the strength of each approach is highly dependent on the evaluation metric and end-user application. Finally, we show that we can train our neural models to remain very robust to the type of noise expected in real-world data (e.g., typos), while a highly-engineered rule-based system fails entirely",

Recent work in theoretical computer science has shown that, in appropriate distributional models, it is possible to robustly estimate the mean and covariance with polynomial time algorithms that can tolerate a constant fraction of corruptions, independent of the dimension. However, the sample and time complexity of these algorithms is prohibitively large for high-dimensional applications. In this work, we address both of these issues by establishing sample complexity bounds that are optimal, up to logarithmic factors, as well as giving various refinements that allow the algorithms to tolerate a much larger fraction of corruptions. Finally, we show on both synthetic and real data that our algorithms have state-of-the-art performance and suddenly make high-dimensional robust estimation a realistic possibility",

In this paper, we develop Probabilistic Path HMC (PPHMC) as a first step to sampling distributions on spaces with intricate combinatorial structure. We define PPHMC on orthant complexes, show that the resulting Markov chain is ergodic, and provide a promising implementation for the case of phylogenetic trees in open-source software.

    "abstract": "Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, allowing them to be deployed in practice. However, explaining why this is the case is still an open area of research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g.\\ Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al.\\ (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Or, depending on the definition of flatness, it is the same for any given minimum. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties",

In contrast to most existing methods, we explicitly model the process of turning a full ranking into an incomplete one, which we call the coarsening process. To this end, we propose the concept of rank-dependent coarsening, which assumes that incomplete rankings are produced by projecting a full ranking to a random subset of ranks. For a concrete instantiation of our model, in which full rankings are drawn from a Plackett-Luce distribution and observations take the form of pairwise preferences, we study the performance of various rank aggregation methods. In addition to predictive accuracy in the finite sample setting, we address the theoretical question of consistency, by which we mean the ability to recover a target ranking when the sample size goes to infinity, despite a potential bias in the observations caused by the (unknown) coarsening",

We use an instantiation of the CFR framework to develop algorithms for solving behaviorally-constrained (and, as a special case, perturbed in the Selten sense) extensive-form games, which allows us to compute approximate Nash equilibrium refinements. Nash equilibrium refinements are motivated by a major deficiency in Nash equilibrium: it provides virtually no guarantees on how it will play in parts of the game tree that are reached with zero probability. Refinements can mend this issue, but have not been adopted in practice, mostly due to a lack of scalable algorithms.

However, existing multi-agent RL methods typically scale poorly in the problem size. Therefore, a key challenge is to translate the success of deep learning on single-agent RL to the multi-agent setting. A major stumbling block is that independent Q-learning, the most popular multi-agent RL method, introduces nonstationarity that makes it incompatible with the experience replay memory on which deep Q-learning relies. This paper proposes two methods that address this problem: 1) using a multi-agent variant of importance sampling to naturally decay obsolete data and 2) conditioning each agent's value function on a fingerprint that disambiguates the age of the data sampled from the replay memory. Results on a challenging decentralised variant of StarCraft unit micromanagement confirm that these methods enable the successful combination of experience replay with multi-agent RL",

    "abstract": "The Multi-Armed Bandit problem with Unobserved Confounders (MABUC) considers decision-making settings where unmeasured variables can influence both the agent's decisions and received rewards (Bareinboim et al., 2015). Recent findings showed that unobserved confounders (UCs) pose a unique challenge to algorithms based on standard randomization (i.e., experimental data); if UCs are naively averaged out, these algorithms behave sub-optimally, possibly incurring infinite regret. In this paper, we show how counterfactual-based decision-making circumvents these problems and leads to a coherent fusion of observational and experimental data. We then demonstrate this new strategy in an enhanced Thompson Sampling bandit player, and support our findings' efficacy with extensive simulations",

Our formulation of the reverse-mode procedure is linked to previous work by Maclaurin et al (2015) but does not require reversible dynamics. Additionally, we explore the use of constraints on the hyperparameters. The forward-mode procedure is suitable for real-time hyperparameter updates, which may significantly speedup hyperparameter optimization on large datasets.

The Gaussian process is directly connected to a black-box classifier that predicts whether a patient will become septic, chosen in our case to be a recurrent neural network to account for the extreme variability in the length of patient encounters. We show how to scale the computations associated with the Gaussian process in a manner so that the entire system can be discriminatively trained end-to-end using backpropagation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Even though active learning forms an important pillar of machine learning, deep learning tools are not prevalent within it. Deep learning poses several difficulties when used in an active learning setting. First, active learning (AL) methods generally rely on being able to learn and update models from small amounts of data. Recent advances in deep learning, on the other hand, are notorious for their dependence on large amounts of data. Second, many AL acquisition functions rely on model uncertainty, yet deep learning methods rarely represent such model uncertainty. In this paper we combine recent advances in Bayesian deep learning into the active learning framework in a practical way. We develop an active learning framework for high dimensional data, a task which has been extremely challenging so far, with very sparse existing literature. Taking advantage of specialised models such as Bayesian convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate our active learning techniques with image data, obtaining a significant improvement on existing active learning approaches. We demonstrate this on both the MNIST dataset, as well as for skin cancer diagnosis from lesion images (ISIC2016 task)",

GGSL also improves on the existing local-to-global learning approaches by removing the need for conflict-resolving AND-rules, and achieves better learning accuracy.

On the negative side, we show that in contrast to results obtained for distributed estimation under convexity assumptions, for the PCA objective, simply averaging the local ERM solutions cannot guarantee error that is consistent with the centralized ERM. We show that this unfortunate phenomena can be remedied by performing a simple correction step which correlates between the individual solutions, and provides an estimator that is consistent with the centralized ERM for sufficiently-large n. We also introduce an iterative distributed algorithm that is applicable in any regime of n, which is based on distributed matrix-vector products.

Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems.

We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches which in turn translates to faster convergence when dealing with costly-to-evaluate functions, such as summary extraction in our experiments",

We present a new framework for this scenario that we call Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) and that allows to find the optimum of a latent function that can only be queried through pairwise comparisons, so-called duels. PBO extend the applicability of standard BO ideas and generalizes previous discrete dueling approaches by modeling the probability of the the winner of each duel by means of Gaussian process model with a Bernoulli likelihood. The latent preference function is used to define a family of acquisition functions that extend usual policies used in BO.

We develop a theory of weak convergence for KSDs based on Stein's method, demonstrate that commonly used KSDs fail to detect non-convergence even for Gaussian targets, and show that kernels with slowly decaying tails provably determine convergence for a large class of target distributions. The resulting convergence-determining KSDs are suitable for comparing biased, exact, and deterministic sample sequences and simpler to compute and parallelize than alternative Stein discrepancies.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actor-critic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces DeepBach, a graphical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach's strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use",

    "title": "Consistent On-Line Off-Policy Evaluation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The problem of on-line off-policy evaluation (OPE) has been actively studied in the last decade due to its importance both as a stand-alone problem and as a module in a policy improvement scheme. However, most Temporal Difference (TD) based solutions ignore the discrepancy between the stationary distribution of the behavior and target policies and its effect on the convergence limit when function approximation is applied. In this paper we propose the Consistent Off-Policy Temporal Difference (COP-TD($\\lambda$, $\\beta$)) algorithm that addresses this issue and reduces this bias at some computational expense. We show that COP-TD($\\lambda$, $\\beta$) can be designed to converge to the same value that would have been obtained by using on-policy TD($\\lambda$) with the target policy. Subsequently, the proposed scheme leads to a related and promising heuristic we call log-COP-TD($\\lambda$, $\\beta$). Both algorithms have favorable empirical results to the current state of the art on-line OPE algorithms. Finally, our formulation sheds some new light on the recently proposed Emphatic TD learning",

In this paper, we develop fast algorithms to find the most likely configuration (MAP) of large-scale DPPs, which is NP-hard in general. Due to the submodular nature of the MAP objective, greedy algorithms have been used with empirical success. Greedy implementations require computation of log-determinants, matrix inverses or solving linear systems at each iteration. We present faster implementations of the greedy algorithms by utilizing the orthogonal benefits of two log-determinant approximation schemes: (a) first-order expansions to the matrix log-determinant function and (b) high-order expansions to the scalar log function with stochastic trace estimators. In our experiments, our algorithms are orders of magnitude faster than their competitors, while sacrificing marginal accuracy",

We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy — the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error.

Our main result shows that for maximizing a monotone submodular function under a cardinality constraint, iteratively selecting an element whose marginal contribution is approximately maximal in expectation is a sufficient condition to obtain the optimal approximation guarantee with exponentially high probability, assuming the cardinality is sufficiently large. One consequence of our result is that the linear-time STOCHASTIC-GREEDY algorithm recently proposed in (Mirzasoleiman et al.,2015) achieves the optimal running time while maintaining an optimal approximation guarantee. We also show that high probability guarantees cannot be obtained for stochastic greedy algorithms under matroid constraints, and prove an approximation guarantee which holds in expectation.

Specifically, the kernelized factorization technique is introduced to approximate the tensor data in kernel space such that the complex nonlinear relationships within tensor data can be explored. Further, dual structural preserving kernels are devised to learn the nonlinear boundary between tensor data. As a result of joint optimization, the kernels obtained in KSTM exhibit better generalization power to discriminative analysis.

This problem arises when users respond only occasionally to a recommendation with a positive rating, and never with a negative one. We study the impact of the probability of a user responding to a recommendation, $p_f$, on the sample complexity, and ask whether receiving positive and negative ratings, instead of positive ratings only, improves the sample complexity. Both questions arise in the design of recommender systems. We introduce a simple probabilistic user model, and analyze the performance of an online user-based CF algorithm. We prove that after an initial cold start phase, where recommendations are invested in exploring the user's preferences, this algorithm makes—up to a fraction of the recommendations required for updating the user's preferences—perfect recommendations. The number of ratings required for the cold start phase is nearly proportional to $1/p_f$, and that for updating the user's preferences is essentially independent of $p_f$. As a consequence we find that, receiving positive and negative ratings instead of only positive ones improves the number of ratings required for initial exploration by a factor of $1/p_f$, which can be significant",

We present a construction that is simple and exact, yet has the same computational complexity that standard convolutions enjoy. It consists of a constant image warp followed by a simple convolution, which are standard blocks in deep learning toolboxes. With a carefully crafted warp, the resulting architecture can be made equivariant to a wide range of two-parameter spatial transformations.

High-throughput virtual screening via computer cluster simulations can speed up the discovery process by collecting very large amounts of data in parallel, e.g., up to hundreds or thousands of parallel measurements. Bayesian optimization (BO) can produce additional acceleration by sequentially identifying the most useful simulations or experiments to be performed next. However, current BO methods cannot scale to the large numbers of parallel measurements and the massive libraries of molecules currently used in high-throughput screening. Here, we propose a scalable solution based on a parallel and distributed implementation of Thompson sampling (PDTS). We show that, in small scale problems, PDTS performs similarly as parallel expected improvement (EI), a batch version of the most widely used BO heuristic. Additionally, in settings where parallel EI does not scale, PDTS outperforms other scalable baselines such as a greedy search, $\\epsilon$-greedy approaches and a random search method.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning discrete representations of data is a central machine learning task because of the compactness of the representations and ease of interpretation. The task includes clustering and hash learning as special cases. Deep neural networks are promising to be used because they can model the non-linearity of data and scale to large datasets. However, their model complexity is huge, and therefore, we need to carefully regularize the networks in order to learn useful representations that exhibit intended invariance for applications of interest. To this end, we propose a method called Information Maximizing Self-Augmented Training (IMSAT). In IMSAT, we use data augmentation to impose the invariance on discrete representations. More specifically, we encourage the predicted representations of augmented data points to be close to those of the original data points in an end-to-end fashion. At the same time, we maximize the information-theoretic dependency between data and their predicted discrete representations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that IMSAT produces state-of-the-art results for both clustering and unsupervised hash learning",

    "abstract": "Modeling temporal sequences plays a fundamental role in various modern applications and has drawn more and more attentions in the machine learning community. Among those efforts on improving the capability to represent temporal data, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has achieved great success in many areas. Although the LSTM can capture long-range dependency in the time domain, it does not explicitly model the pattern occurrences in the frequency domain that plays an important role in tracking and predicting data points over various time cycles. We propose the State-Frequency Memory (SFM), a novel recurrent architecture that allows to separate dynamic patterns across different frequency components and their impacts on modeling the temporal contexts of input sequences. By jointly decomposing memorized dynamics into state-frequency components, the SFM is able to offer a fine-grained analysis of temporal sequences by capturing the dependency of uncovered patterns in both time and frequency domains. Evaluations on several temporal modeling tasks demonstrate the SFM can yield competitive performances, in particular as compared with the state-of-the-art LSTM models",

Our framework handles both (1) and (2) via a clean, unified model, which enjoys full local conjugacy via data augmentation, and facilitates efficient inference via closed form Gibbs sampling. Moreover, inference cost scales in the number of edges which is attractive for massive but sparse networks. Our framework is also easily extendable to model weighted networks with count-valued edges.

With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces short sentences with desired attributes of sentiment and tenses.

Often, real data tensors are not only low dimensional, but also smooth, meaning that the adjacent elements are similar or continuously changing, which typically appear as spatial or temporal data. To incorporate the smoothness property, we propose the smoothed Tucker decomposition (STD). STD leverages the smoothness by the sum of a few basis functions, which reduces the number of parameters. The objective function is formulated as a convex problem and, to solve that, an algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is derived. We theoretically show that, under the smoothness assumption, STD achieves a better error bound. The theoretical result and performances of STD are numerically verified",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training directed neural networks typically requires forward-propagating data through a computation graph, followed by backpropagating error signal, to produce weight updates. All layers, or more generally, modules, of the network are therefore locked, in the sense that they must wait for the remainder of the network to execute forwards and propagate error backwards before they can be updated. In this work we break this constraint by decoupling modules by introducing a model of the future computation of the network graph. These models predict what the result of the modelled subgraph will produce using only local information. In particular we focus on modelling error gradients: by using the modelled synthetic gradient in place of true backpropagated error gradients we decouple subgraphs, and can update them independently and asynchronously i.e. we realise decoupled neural interfaces. We show results for feed-forward models, where every layer is trained asynchronously, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where predicting one's future gradient extends the time over which the RNN can effectively model, and also a hierarchical RNN system with ticking at different timescales. Finally, we demonstrate that in addition to predicting gradients, the same framework can be used to predict inputs, resulting in models which are decoupled in both the forward and backwards pass – amounting to independent networks which co-learn such that they can be composed into a single functioning corporation",

The underlying latent factor model also assumes that the low-dimensional embeddings of each label vector are directly conditioned on the respective feature vector of that example. Our generative framework admits a simple inference procedure, such that the parameter estimation reduces to a sequence of simple weighted least-square regression problems, each of which can be solved easily, efficiently, and in parallel. Moreover, inference can also be performed in an online fashion using mini-batches of training examples, which makes our framework scalable for large data sets, even when using moderate computational resources.

Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To formalize this objective, we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications; 1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2) computational molecular generation. For both problems, we show that the proposed method improves the desired properties and structure of the generated sequences, while maintaining information learned from data",

We introduce a novel surrogate model for Bayesian optimization which combines independent Gaussian Processes with a linear model that encodes a tree-based dependency structure and can transfer information between overlapping decision sequences.

While previous EPLL methods modeled image patches with finite Gaussian mixtures, we use nonparametric Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures to create models whose complexity grows as additional images are observed. An extension based on the hierarchical DP then captures repetitive and self-similar structure via image-specific variations in cluster frequencies. We derive a structured variational inference algorithm that adaptively creates new patch clusters to more accurately model novel image textures.

Firstly, the representation capacity of the unitary space in an EUNN is fully tunable, ranging from a subspace of SU(N) to the entire unitary space. Secondly, the computational complexity for training an EUNN is merely $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per parameter. Finally, we test the performance of EUNNs on the standard copying task, the pixel-permuted MNIST digit recognition benchmark as well as the Speech Prediction Test (TIMIT).

These features are chosen so as to maximize a lower bound on the test power, resulting in a test that is data-efficient, and that runs in linear time (with respect to the sample size n). The optimized features can be interpreted as evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating regions in the joint domain where the joint distribution and the product of the marginals differ most. Consistency of the independence test is established, for an appropriate choice of features. In real-world benchmarks, independence tests using the optimized features perform comparably to the state-of-the-art quadratic-time HSIC test, and outperform competing O(n) and O(n log n) tests",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Coordinate descent (CD) is a scalable and simple algorithm for solving many optimization problems in machine learning. Despite this fact, CD can also be very computationally wasteful. Due to sparsity in sparse regression problems, for example, the majority of CD updates often result in no progress toward the solution. To address this inefficiency, we propose a modified CD algorithm named \"StingyCD.\" By skipping over many updates that are guaranteed to not decrease the objective value, StingyCD significantly reduces convergence times. Since StingyCD only skips updates with this guarantee, however, StingyCD does not fully exploit the problem's sparsity. For this reason, we also propose StingyCD+, an algorithm that achieves further speed-ups by skipping updates more aggressively. Since StingyCD and StingyCD+ rely on simple modifications to CD, it is also straightforward to use these algorithms with other approaches to scaling optimization. In empirical comparisons, StingyCD and StingyCD+ improve convergence times considerably for several L1-regularized optimization problems",

Without any assumptions, this problem is known to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we make the assumption that data matrix satisfies restricted isometry property, and show that this assumption leads to computationally efficient algorithms with sublinear regret for two variants of the problem.

The standard approach to this problem is regress and compare: split the training data by treatment, fit a regression model in each split, and, for a new instance, predict all $m$ outcomes and pick the best. By reformulating the problem as a single learning task rather than $m$ separate ones, we propose a new approach based on recursively partitioning the data into regimes where different treatments are optimal. We extend this approach to an optimal partitioning approach that finds a globally optimal partition, achieving a compact, interpretable, and impactful personalization model.

    "abstract": "Bandit methods for black-box optimisation, such as Bayesian optimisation, are used in a variety of applications including hyper-parameter tuning and experiment design. Recently, multi-fidelity methods have garnered considerable attention since function evaluations have become increasingly expensive in such applications. Multi-fidelity methods use cheap approximations to the function of interest to speed up the overall optimisation process. However, most multi-fidelity methods assume only a finite number of approximations. On the other hand, in many practical applications, a continuous spectrum of approximations might be available. For instance, when tuning an expensive neural network, one might choose to approximate the cross validation performance using less data $N$ and/or few training iterations $T$. Here, the approximations are best viewed as arising out of a continuous two dimensional space $(N,T)$. In this work, we develop a Bayesian optimisation method, BOCA, for this setting. We characterise its theoretical properties and show that it achieves better regret than than strategies which ignore the approximations. BOCA outperforms several other baselines in synthetic and real experiments",

We study algorithms which attempt to select the highest quality subset despite the fact that true CDF values are not known, and can only be estimated from the finite pool of candidates. Specifically, we quantify the regret in quality imposed by \"meritocratic\" notions of fairness, which require that individuals are selected with probability that is monotonically increasing in their true quality. We give algorithms with provable fairness and regret guarantees, as well as lower bounds, and provide empirical results which suggest that our algorithms perform better than the theory suggests.

SplitNet thus greatly reduces the number of parameters and requires significantly less computations, and is also embarrassingly model parallelizable at test time, since the network evaluation for each subnetwork is completely independent except for the shared lower layer weights that can be duplicated over multiple processors. We validate our method with two deep network models (ResNet and AlexNet) on two different datasets (CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC 2012) for image classification, on which our method obtains networks with significantly reduced number of parameters while achieving comparable or superior classification accuracies over original full deep networks, and accelerated test speed with multiple GPUs",

Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bonsai can make predictions in milliseconds even on slow microcontrollers, can fit in KB of memory, has lower battery consumption than all other algorithms while achieving prediction accuracies that can be as much as 30\\% higher than state-of-the-art methods for resource-efficient machine learning. Bonsai is also shown to generalize to other resource constrained settings beyond IoT by generating significantly better search results as compared to Bing's L3 ranker when the model size is restricted to 300 bytes.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have been wildly successful at learning coherent latent representations for continuous data such as natural images, artwork, and audio. However, generative modeling of discrete data such as arithmetic expressions and molecular structures still poses significant challenges. Crucially, state-of-the-art methods often produce outputs that are not valid. We make the key observation that frequently, discrete data can be represented as a parse tree from a context-free grammar. We propose a variational autoencoder which directly encodes from and decodes to these parse trees, ensuring the generated outputs are always syntactically valid. Surprisingly, we show that not only does our model more often generate valid outputs, it also learns a more coherent latent space in which nearby points decode to similar discrete outputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our learned models by showing their improved performance in Bayesian optimization for symbolic regression and molecule generation",

The proposed method uses the entropy regularized optimal transport between empirical measures defined on data instances and features in order to obtain an estimated joint probability density function represented by the optimal coupling matrix. This matrix is further factorized to obtain the induced row and columns partitions using multiscale representations approach. To justify our method theoretically, we show how the solution of the regularized optimal transport can be seen from the variational inference perspective thus motivating its use for co-clustering. The algorithm derived for the proposed method and its kernelized version based on the notion of Gromov-Wasserstein distance are fast, accurate and can determine automatically the number of both row and column clusters.

With points arriving online, the goal is to maintain a constant approximate solution, while minimizing the number of reclusterings necessary. We prove a lower bound, showing that $\\Omega(k \\log n)$ changes are necessary in the worst case for a wide range of objective functions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Clustering is the task of grouping a set of examples so that similar examples are grouped into the same cluster while dissimilar examples are in different clusters. The quality of a clustering depends on two problem-dependent factors which are i) the chosen similarity metric and ii) the data representation. Supervised clustering approaches, which exploit labeled partitioned datasets have thus been proposed, for instance to learn a metric optimized to perform clustering. However, most of these approaches assume that the representation of the data is fixed and then learn an appropriate linear transformation. Some deep supervised clustering learning approaches have also been proposed. However, they rely on iterative methods to compute gradients resulting in high algorithmic complexity. In this paper, we propose a deep supervised clustering metric learning method that formulates a novel loss function. We derive a closed-form expression for the gradient that is efficient to compute: the complexity to compute the gradient is linear in the size of the training mini-batch and quadratic in the representation dimensionality. We further reveal how our approach can be seen as learning spectral clustering. Experiments on standard real-world datasets confirm state-of-the-art Recall@K performance",

In particular, our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate the power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy.

Our construction readily extends to capture the structure of latent factors, similarly to stochastic block-models, while maintaining its power law degree distribution. The BFRY random variables are well approximated by gamma random variables in a variational Bayesian inference routine, which we apply to several network datasets for which power law degree distributions are a natural assumption. By learning the parameters of the BFRY distribution via probabilistic inference, we are able to automatically select the appropriate power law behavior from the data.

We demonstrate the effect of CMCL via experiments on the image classification on CIFAR and SVHN, and the foreground-background segmentation on the iCoseg.

Dropout variational inference (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical applications, but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty. Alpha-divergences are alternative divergences to VI's KL objective, which are able to avoid VI's uncertainty underestimation. But these are hard to use in practice: existing techniques can only use Gaussian approximating distributions, and require existing models to be changed radically, thus are of limited use for practitioners. We propose a re-parametrisation of the alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference technique which, together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing models by simply changing the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates and accuracy compared to VI in dropout networks. We study our model's epistemic uncertainty far away from the data using adversarial images, showing that these can be distinguished from non-adversarial images by examining our model's uncertainty",

This paper proposes a simple and natural alternating gradient descent based algorithm, and shows that with a mild initialization it provably recovers the ground-truth in the presence of strong correlations. In most interesting cases, the correlation can be in the same order as the highest possible. Our analysis also reveals its several favorable features including robustness to noise.

In this work, we propose an upper confidence bound based algorithm for generalized linear contextual bandits, which achieves an $\\sim O(\\sqrt{dT})$ regret over T rounds with d dimensional feature vectors. This regret matches the minimax lower bound, up to logarithmic terms, and improves on the best previous result by a $\\sqrt{d}$ factor, assuming the number of arms is fixed.

In particular, a linear increase in intrinsic dimensionality, or equivalently, an exponential increase in the number of points near a query, can be mostly counteracted with just a linear increase in space. We also demonstrate empirically that Prioritized DCI significantly outperforms prior methods.

Subspace clustering algorithms in particular are often applied to problems that fit this description, for example with face images or handwritten digits. While it is straightforward to request human input on these datasets, our goal is to reduce this input as much as possible. We present a pairwise-constrained clustering algorithm that actively selects queries based on the union-of-subspaces model. The central step of the algorithm is in querying points of minimum margin between estimated subspaces; analogous to classifier margin, these lie near the decision boundary. We prove that points lying near the intersection of subspaces are points with low margin. Our procedure can be used after any subspace clustering algorithm that outputs an affinity matrix. We demonstrate on several datasets that our algorithm drives the clustering error down considerably faster than the state-of-the-art active query algorithms on datasets with subspace structure and is competitive on other datasets",

    "title": "Zero-Inflated Exponential Family Embeddings",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Word embeddings are a widely-used tool to analyze language, and exponential family embeddings (Rudolph et al., 2016) generalize the technique to other types of data. One challenge to fitting embedding methods is sparse data, such as a document/term matrix that contains many zeros. To address this issue, practitioners typically downweight or subsample the zeros, thus focusing learning on the non-zero entries. In this paper, we develop zero-inflated embeddings, a new embedding method that is designed to learn from sparse observations. In a zero-inflated embedding (ZIE), a zero in the data can come from an interaction to other data (i.e., an embedding) or from a separate process by which many observations are equal to zero (i.e. a probability mass at zero). Fitting a ZIE naturally downweights the zeros and dampens their influence on the model. Across many types of data—language, movie ratings, shopping histories, and bird watching logs—we found that zero-inflated embeddings provide improved predictive performance over standard approaches and find better vector representation of items",

We show that the teaching complexity in the iterative case is very different from that in the batch case. Instead of constructing a minimal training set for learners, our iterative machine teaching focuses on achieving fast convergence in the learner model. Depending on the level of information the teacher has from the learner model, we design teaching algorithms which can provably reduce the number of teaching examples and achieve faster convergence than learning without teachers.

    "title": "Dual Iterative Hard Thresholding: From Non-convex Sparse Minimization to Non-smooth Concave Maximization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) is a class of projected gradient descent methods for optimizing sparsity-constrained minimization models, with the best known efficiency and scalability in practice. As far as we know, the existing IHT-style methods are designed for sparse minimization in primal form. It remains open to explore duality theory and algorithms in such a non-convex and NP-hard setting. In this article, we bridge the gap by establishing a duality theory for sparsity-constrained minimization with $\\ell_2$-regularized objective and proposing an IHT-style algorithm for dual maximization. Our sparse duality theory provides a set of sufficient and necessary conditions under which the original NP-hard/non-convex problem can be equivalently solved in a dual space. The proposed dual IHT algorithm is a super-gradient method for maximizing the non-smooth dual objective. An interesting finding is that the sparse recovery performance of dual IHT is invariant to the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), which is required by all the existing primal IHT without sparsity relaxation. Moreover, a stochastic variant of dual IHT is proposed for large-scale stochastic optimization. Numerical results demonstrate that dual IHT algorithms can achieve more accurate model estimation given small number of training data and have higher computational efficiency than the state-of-the-art primal IHT-style algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most existing sequence labelling models rely on a fixed decomposition of a target sequence into a sequence of basic units. These methods suffer from two major drawbacks: $1$) the set of basic units is fixed, such as the set of words, characters or phonemes in speech recognition, and $2$) the decomposition of target sequences is fixed. These drawbacks usually result in sub-optimal performance of modeling sequences. In this paper, we extend the popular CTC loss criterion to alleviate these limitations, and propose a new loss function called Gram-CTC. While preserving the advantages of CTC, Gram-CTC automatically learns the best set of basic units (grams), as well as the most suitable decomposition of target sequences. Unlike CTC, Gram-CTC allows the model to output variable number of characters at each time step, which enables the model to capture longer term dependency and improves the computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed Gram-CTC improves CTC in terms of both performance and efficiency on the large vocabulary speech recognition task at multiple scales of data, and that with Gram-CTC we can outperform the state-of-the-art on a standard speech benchmark",

In this work we give an online algorithm for ILN, which avoids the kernel trick assumption. More generally and of independent interest, we show that kernel methods in general can be exploited even when the kernel cannot be efficiently computed but can only be estimated via sampling. We provide a regret analysis for our algorithm, showing that it matches the sample complexity of methods which have access to kernel values.

Our proposal makes use of non-conjugate hierarchical priors to explicitly model temporal changes of the model parameters.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of learning a ranking by using adaptively chosen pairwise comparisons. Our goal is to recover the ranking accurately but to sample the comparisons sparingly. If all comparison outcomes are consistent with the ranking, the optimal solution is to use an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quicksort. But how do sorting algorithms behave if some comparison outcomes are inconsistent with the ranking? We give favorable guarantees for Quicksort for the popular Bradley-Terry model, under natural assumptions on the parameters. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that sorting algorithms lead to a very simple and effective active learning strategy: repeatedly sort the items. This strategy performs as well as state-of-the-art methods (and much better than random sampling) at a minuscule fraction of the computational cost",

We achieve this by introducing an auxiliary discriminative network that allows to rephrase the maximum-likelihood-problem as a two-player game, hence establishing a principled connection between VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We show that in the nonparametric limit our method yields an exact maximum-likelihood assignment for the parameters of the generative model, as well as the exact posterior distribution over the latent variables given an observation.

These methods either have limited expressiveness or scale poorly with the size of the network when compared with the simple RNN case, especially when using stochastic gradient descent with a small mini-batch size. Our contributions are as follows; we first show that constraining the transition matrix to be unitary is a special case of an orthogonal constraint. Then we present a new parametrisation of the transition matrix which allows efficient training of an RNN while ensuring that the matrix is always orthogonal. Our results show that the orthogonal constraint on the transition matrix applied through our parametrisation gives similar benefits to the unitary constraint, without the time complexity limitations",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a growth in size and computational requirements for training and inference with neural networks. Currently, a common approach to address these requirements is to use a heterogeneous distributed environment with a mixture of hardware devices such as CPUs and GPUs. Importantly, the decision of placing parts of the neural models on devices is often made by human experts based on simple heuristics and intuitions. In this paper, we propose a method which learns to optimize device placement for TensorFlow computational graphs. Key to our method is the use of a sequence-to-sequence model to predict which subsets of operations in a TensorFlow graph should run on which of the available devices. The execution time of the predicted placements is then used as the reward signal to optimize the parameters of the sequence-to-sequence model. Our main result is that on Inception-V3 for ImageNet classification, and on RNN LSTM, for language modeling and neural machine translation, our model finds non-trivial device placements that outperform hand-crafted heuristics and traditional algo-rithmic methods",

Our result provides a constructive proof for the Approximate Carathéodory Problem, which states that any point inside a polytope contained in the $\\ell_p$ ball of radius $D$ can be approximated to within $\\epsilon$ in $\\ell_p$ norm by a convex combination of $O\\left(D^2 p/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ vertices of the polytope for $p \\geq 2$. While for the particular case of $p=2$, this can be achieved by the well-known Perceptron algorithm, we follow a more principled approach which generalizes to arbitrary $p\\geq 2$; furthermore, this naturally extends to domains with more complicated geometry, as it is the case for providing an approximate Birkhoff-von Neumann decomposition. Secondly, we show that the sparsity bound is tight for $\\ell_p$ norms, using an argument based on anti-concentration for the binomial distribution, thus resolving an open question posed by Barman. Experimentally, we verify that our deterministic optimization-based algorithms achieve in practice much better sparsity than previously known sampling-based algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a framework that allows for the incorporation of the feature side-information during the learning of very general model families to improve the prediction performance. We control the structures of the learned models so that they reflect features' similarities as these are defined on the basis of the side-information.

    "abstract": "We present a model that, after learning on observations of (sequence, outcome) pairs, can be efficiently used to revise a new sequence in order to improve its associated outcome. Our framework requires neither example improvements, nor additional evaluation of outcomes for proposed revisions. To avoid combinatorial-search over sequence elements, we specify a generative model with continuous latent factors, which is learned via joint approximate inference using a recurrent variational autoencoder (VAE) and an outcome-predicting neural network module. Under this model, gradient methods can be used to efficiently optimize the continuous latent factors with respect to inferred outcomes. By appropriately constraining this optimization and using the VAE decoder to generate a revised sequence, we ensure the revision is fundamentally similar to the original sequence, is associated with better outcomes, and looks natural. These desiderata are proven to hold with high probability under our approach, which is empirically demonstrated for revising natural language sentences",

When gradients in certain blocks of features (for coordinate descent) or examples (for SGD) are larger than others, there is a natural structure that can be exploited for quicker convergence. Yet adaptive variants often suffer nontrivial computational overhead. We present a framework that discovers and leverages such structural properties at a low computational cost. We employ a bandit optimization procedure that \"learns\" probabilities for sampling coordinates or examples in (non-smooth) optimization problems, allowing us to guarantee performance close to that of the optimal stationary sampling distribution.

    "abstract": "Many neural networks exhibit stability in their activation patterns over time in response to inputs from sensors operating under real-world conditions. By capitalizing on this property of natural signals, we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture called a delta network in which each neuron transmits its value only when the change in its activation exceeds a threshold. The execution of RNNs as delta networks is attractive because their states must be stored and fetched at every timestep, unlike in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show that a naive run-time delta network implementation offers modest improvements on the number of memory accesses and computes, but optimized training techniques confer higher accuracy at higher speedup. With these optimizations, we demonstrate a 9X reduction in cost with negligible loss of accuracy for the TIDIGITS audio digit recognition benchmark. Similarly, on the large Wall Street Journal (WSJ) speech recognition benchmark, pretrained networks can also be greatly accelerated as delta networks and trained delta networks show a 5.7x improvement with negligible loss of accuracy. Finally, on an end-to-end CNN-RNN network trained for steering angle prediction in a driving dataset, the RNN cost can be reduced by a substantial 100X",

In this paper, we investigate the following question: for a given model, is it possible to compute an inference result with any convenient false prior, and afterwards, given any target prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the target posterior? A potential solution is to use importance sampling (IS). However, we demonstrate that IS will fail for many choices of the target prior, depending on its parametric form and similarity to the false prior. Instead, we propose prior swapping, a method that leverages the pre-inferred false posterior to efficiently generate accurate posterior samples under arbitrary target priors. Prior swapping lets us apply less-costly inference algorithms to certain models, and incorporate new or updated prior information \"post-inference\". We give theoretical guarantees about our method, and demonstrate it empirically on a number of models and priors",

We answer the first question by demonstrating the use of PixelCNN, an advanced neural density model for images, to supply a pseudo-count. In particular, we examine the intrinsic difficulties in adapting Bellemare et al.'s approach when assumptions about the model are violated. The result is a more practical and general algorithm requiring no special apparatus. We combine PixelCNN pseudo-counts with different agent architectures to dramatically improve the state of the art on several hard Atari games.

We evaluate our algorithm by performing two types of experiments: image in-painting and image denoising. In both cases, we find that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art dictionary learning techniques. Beyond the algorithm itself, two aspects of this study are interesting in their own right. The first is our statistical formulation of the problem, which unifies the topics of dictionary learning and independent component analysis. The second is a generalization of a classical theorem about isometries of $\\ell_p$-norms that constitutes the foundation of our approach",

In such cases, curiosity can serve as an intrinsic reward signal to enable the agent to explore its environment and learn skills that might be useful later in its life. We formulate curiosity as the error in an agent's ability to predict the consequence of its own actions in a visual feature space learned by a self-supervised inverse dynamics model. Our formulation scales to high-dimensional continuous state spaces like images, bypasses the difficulties of directly predicting pixels, and, critically, ignores the aspects of the environment that cannot affect the agent. The proposed approach is evaluated in two environments: VizDoom and Super Mario Bros. Three broad settings are investigated: 1) sparse extrinsic reward, where curiosity allows for far fewer interactions with the environment to reach the goal; 2) exploration with no extrinsic reward, where curiosity pushes the agent to explore more efficiently; and 3) generalization to unseen scenarios (e.g. new levels of the same game) where the knowledge gained from earlier experience helps the agent explore new places much faster than starting from scratch",

To solve this problem, we propose ADVGP, the first Asynchronous Distributed Variational Gaussian Process inference for regression, on the recent large-scale machine learning platform, PARAMETER SERVER. ADVGP uses a novel, flexible variational framework based on a weight space augmentation, and implements the highly efficient, asynchronous proximal gradient optimization. While maintaining comparable or better predictive performance, ADVGP greatly improves upon the efficiency of the existing variational methods. With ADVGP, we effortlessly scale up GP regression to a real-world application with billions of samples and demonstrate an excellent, superior prediction accuracy to the popular linear models",

The shape of the spectrum depends strongly on the energy and another key parameter, $\\phi$, which measures the ratio of parameters to data points. Our analysis predicts and numerical simulations support that for critical points of small index, the number of negative eigenvalues scales like the 3/2 power of the energy.

In contrast to previous work, which required that annotated training data must be available for all tasks, we consider a new setting, in which for some tasks, potentially most of them, only unlabeled training data is provided. Consequently, to solve all tasks, information must be transferred between tasks with labels and tasks without labels. Focusing on an instance-based transfer method we analyze two variants of this setting: when the set of labeled tasks is fixed, and when it can be actively selected by the learner. We state and prove a generalization bound that covers both scenarios and derive from it an algorithm for making the choice of labeled tasks (in the active case) and for transferring information between the tasks in a principled way.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks coupled with fast simulation and improved computational speeds have led to recent successes in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). However, most current RL-based approaches fail to generalize since: (a) the gap between simulation and real world is so large that policy-learning approaches fail to transfer; (b) even if policy learning is done in real world, the data scarcity leads to failed generalization from training to test scenarios (e.g., due to different friction or object masses). Inspired from H-infinity control methods, we note that both modeling errors and differences in training and test scenarios can just be viewed as extra forces/disturbances in the system. This paper proposes the idea of robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), where we train an agent to operate in the presence of a destabilizing adversary that applies disturbance forces to the system. The jointly trained adversary is reinforced – that is, it learns an optimal destabilization policy. We formulate the policy learning as a zero-sum, minimax objective function. Extensive experiments in multiple environments (InvertedPendulum, HalfCheetah, Swimmer, Hopper, Walker2d and Ant) conclusively demonstrate that our method (a) improves training stability; (b) is robust to differences in training/test conditions; and c) outperform the baseline even in the absence of the adversary",

In the proposed approach, an outlier is set apart from an inlier by comparing their coherence with the rest of the data points. As inliers lie on a low dimensional subspace, they are likely to have strong mutual coherence provided there are enough inliers. By contrast, outliers do not typically admit low dimensional structures, wherefore an outlier is unlikely to bear strong resemblance with a large number of data points. The mutual coherences are computed by forming the Gram matrix of normalized data points. Subsequently, the subspace is recovered from the span of a small subset of the data points that exhibit strong coherence with the rest of the data. As coherence pursuit only involves one simple matrix multiplication, it is significantly faster than the state of-the-art robust PCA algorithms. We provide a mathematical analysis of the proposed algorithm under a random model for the distribution of the inliers and outliers. It is shown that the proposed method can recover the correct subspace even if the data is predominantly outliers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provable robust PCA algorithm that is simultaneously non-iterative, can tolerate a large number of outliers and is robust to linearly dependent outliers",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is an efficient way to optimize expensive black-box functions such as designing a new product with highest quality or hyperparameter tuning of a machine learning algorithm. However, it has a serious limitation when the parameter space is high-dimensional as Bayesian optimization crucially depends on solving a global optimization of a surrogate utility function in the same sized dimensions. The surrogate utility function, known commonly as acquisition function is a continuous function but can be extremely sharp at high dimension - having only a few peaks marooned in a large terrain of almost flat surface. Global optimization algorithms such as DIRECT are infeasible at higher dimensions and gradient-dependent methods cannot move if initialized in the flat terrain. We propose an algorithm that enables local gradient-dependent algorithms to move through the flat terrain by using a sequence of gross-to-finer Gaussian process priors on the objective function as we leverage two underlying facts - a) there exists a large enough length-scales for which the acquisition function can be made to have a significant gradient at any location in the parameter space, and b) the extrema of the consecutive acquisition functions are close although they are different only due to a small difference in the length-scales. Theoretical guarantees are provided and experiments clearly demonstrate the utility of the proposed method at high dimension using both benchmark test functions and real-world case studies",

Our algorithm typically produces file sizes 3 times smaller than JPEG, 2.5 times smaller than JPEG 2000, and 2.3 times smaller than WebP on datasets of generic images across a spectrum of quality levels. At the same time, our codec is designed to be lightweight and deployable: for example, it can encode or decode the Kodak dataset in less than 10ms per image on GPU. Our architecture is an autoencoder featuring pyramidal analysis, an adaptive coding module, and regularization of the expected codelength.

The decision maker must query one of the linear models for each incoming context, and receives an observation corrupted by noise levels that are unknown, and depend on the model instance. We present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the noise levels while balancing contexts accordingly across the different linear functions, and derive guarantees for simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. Finally, we extend the algorithm and its guarantees to high dimensional settings, where the number of linear models times the dimension of the contextual space is higher than the total budget of samples. Simulations with real data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust, outperforming a number of baselines even when its assumptions are violated",

While past work sought to advance our understanding of these models, none has made use of the rich history of problem descriptions, theories, and experimental methods developed by cognitive psychologists to study the human mind. To explore the potential value of these tools, we chose a well-established analysis from developmental psychology that explains how children learn word labels for objects, and applied that analysis to DNNs. Using datasets of stimuli inspired by the original cognitive psychology experiments, we find that state-of-the-art one shot learning models trained on ImageNet exhibit a similar bias to that observed in humans: they prefer to categorize objects according to shape rather than color. The magnitude of this shape bias varies greatly among architecturally identical, but differently seeded models, and even fluctuates within seeds throughout training, despite nearly equivalent classification performance. These results demonstrate the capability of tools from cognitive psychology for exposing hidden computational properties of DNNs, while concurrently providing us with a computational model for human word learning",

In this paper, we propose the use of an asymmetric tri-training method for unsupervised domain adaptation, where we assign pseudo-labels to unlabeled samples and train the neural networks as if they are true labels. In our work, we use three networks asymmetrically, and by asymmetric, we mean that two networks are used to label unlabeled target samples, and one network is trained by the pseudo-labeled samples to obtain target-discriminative representations.

On one hand, this models natural situations where the exact order of the learner's responses is not crucial, and on the other hand, might allow better learning and regret performance, by mitigating highly adversarial loss sequences. Also, with random permutations, this can be seen as a setting interpolating between adversarial and stochastic losses. In this paper, we consider the applicability of this setting to convex online learning with delayed feedback, in which the feedback on the prediction made in round $t$ arrives with some delay $\\tau$. With such delayed feedback, the best possible regret bound is well-known to be $O(\\sqrt{\\tau T})$. We prove that by being able to permute losses by a distance of at most $M$ (for $M\\geq \\tau$), the regret can be improved to $O(\\sqrt{T}(1+\\sqrt{\\tau^2/M}))$, using a Mirror-Descent based algorithm which can be applied for both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Linear regression is one of the most prevalent techniques in machine learning; however, it is also common to use linear regression for its explanatory capabilities rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics to establish a correlation between an attribute (e.g. gender) and a label (e.g. income) in the presence of other (potentially correlated) features. OLS assumes a particular model that randomly generates the data, and derives t-values — representing the likelihood of each real value to be the true correlation. Using t-values, OLS can release a confidence interval, which is an interval on the reals that is likely to contain the true correlation; and when this interval does not intersect the origin, we can reject the null hypothesis as it is likely that the true correlation is non-zero. Our work aims at achieving similar guarantees on data under differentially private estimators. First, we show that for well-spread data, the Gaussian Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (JLT) gives a very good approximation of t-values; secondly, when JLT approximates Ridge regression (linear regression with $l_2$-regularization) we derive, under certain conditions, confidence intervals using the projected data; lastly, we derive, under different conditions, confidence intervals for the \"Analyze Gauss\" algorithm (Dwork et al 2014)",

    "title": "On the Iteration Complexity of Support Recovery via Hard Thresholding Pursuit",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recovering the support of a sparse signal from its compressed samples has been one of the most important problems in high dimensional statistics. In this paper, we present a novel analysis for the hard thresholding pursuit (HTP) algorithm, showing that it exactly recovers the support of an arbitrary s-sparse signal within O(sklogk) iterations via a properly chosen proxy function, where k is the condition number of the problem. In stark contrast to the theoretical results in the literature, the iteration complexity we obtained holds without assuming the restricted isometry property, or relaxing the sparsity, or utilizing the optimality of the underlying signal. We further extend our result to a more challenging scenario, where the subproblem involved in HTP cannot be solved exactly. We prove that even in this setting, support recovery is possible and the computational complexity of HTP is established. Numerical study substantiates our theoretical results",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a fast Gauss-Seidel Operator Splitting (GSOS) algorithm for addressing multi-term nonsmooth convex composite optimization, which has wide applications in machine learning, signal processing and statistics. The proposed GSOS algorithm inherits the advantage of the Gauss-Seidel technique to accelerate the optimization procedure, and leverages the operator splitting technique to reduce the computational complexity. In addition, we develop a new technique to establish the global convergence of the GSOS algorithm. To be specific, we first reformulate the iterations of GSOS as a two-step iterations algorithm by employing the tool of operator optimization theory. Subsequently, we establish the convergence of GSOS based on the two-step iterations algorithm reformulation. At last, we apply the proposed GSOS algorithm to solve overlapping group Lasso and graph-guided fused Lasso problems. Numerical experiments show that our proposed GSOS algorithm is superior to the state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness",

The two main challenges are: (i) to curate a large, diverse set of interesting web-based tasks, and (ii) to ensure that these tasks have a well-defined reward structure and are reproducible despite the transience of the web. To do this, we develop a methodology in which crowdworkers create tasks defined by natural language questions and provide demonstrations of how to answer the question on real websites using keyboard and mouse; HTTP traffic is cached to create a reproducible offline approximation of the web site.

    "abstract": "The purported \"black box\" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where interpretability is essential. Here we present DeepLIFT (Deep Learning Important FeaTures), a method for decomposing the output prediction of a neural network on a specific input by backpropagating the contributions of all neurons in the network to every feature of the input. DeepLIFT compares the activation of each neuron to its `reference activation' and assigns contribution scores according to the difference. By optionally giving separate consideration to positive and negative contributions, DeepLIFT can also reveal dependencies which are missed by other approaches. Scores can be computed efficiently in a single backward pass. We apply DeepLIFT to models trained on MNIST and simulated genomic data, and show significant advantages over gradient-based methods.

    "title": "Optimal Densification for Fast and Accurate Minwise Hashing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Minwise hashing is a fundamental and one of the most successful hashing algorithm in the literature. Recent advances based on the idea of densification (Shrivastava \\& Li, 2014) have shown that it is possible to compute $k$ minwise hashes, of a vector with $d$ nonzeros, in mere $(d + k)$ computations, a significant improvement over the classical $O(dk)$. These advances have led to an algorithmic improvement in the query complexity of traditional indexing algorithms based on minwise hashing. Unfortunately, the variance of the current densification techniques is unnecessarily high, which leads to significantly poor accuracy compared to vanilla minwise hashing, especially when the data is sparse. In this paper, we provide a novel densification scheme which relies on carefully tailored 2-universal hashes. We show that the proposed scheme is variance-optimal, and without losing the runtime efficiency, it is significantly more accurate than existing densification techniques. As a result, we obtain a significantly efficient hashing scheme which has the same variance and collision probability as minwise hashing. Experimental evaluations on real sparse and high-dimensional datasets validate our claims. We believe that given the significant advantages, our method will replace minwise hashing implementations in practice",

Hybrid blending is the key to effective training of the BCDE, which avoids overfitting and provides a novel mechanism for leveraging unlabeled data.

We then discuss in detail how to utilize this sparsity to conduct GBDT training, including splitting the nodes, computing the sparse residual, and predicting in sublinear time.

    "abstract": "Along with the recent advances in scalable Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, sampling techniques that are based on Langevin diffusions have started receiving increasing attention. These so called Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) methods are based on diffusions driven by a Brownian motion, which gives rise to Gaussian proposal distributions in the resulting algorithms. Even though these approaches have proven successful in many applications, their performance can be limited by the light-tailed nature of the Gaussian proposals. In this study, we extend classical LMC and develop a novel Fractional LMC (FLMC) framework that is based on a family of heavy-tailed distributions, called alpha-stable Levy distributions. As opposed to classical approaches, the proposed approach can possess large jumps while targeting the correct distribution, which would be beneficial for efficient exploration of the state space. We develop novel computational methods that can scale up to large-scale problems and we provide formal convergence analysis of the proposed scheme. Our experiments support our theory: FLMC can provide superior performance in multi-modal settings, improved convergence rates, and robustness to algorithm parameters",

This problem has recently received attention in two settings: (1) where p is assumed to be Gaussian and (2) where p is assumed only to lie in a large nonparametric smoothness class. Estimators proposed for the Gaussian case converge in high dimensions when the Gaussian assumption holds, but are brittle, failing dramatically when p is not Gaussian, while estimators proposed for the nonparametric case fail to converge with realistic sample sizes except in very low dimension. Hence, there is a lack of robust mutual information estimators for many realistic data. To address this, we propose estimators for mutual information when p is assumed to be a nonparanormal (or Gaussian copula) model, a semiparametric compromise between Gaussian and nonparametric extremes. Using theoretical bounds and experiments, we show these estimators strike a practical balance between robustness and scalability",

The resulting problem is a nonconvex-concave saddle point problem (or game).

In modern applications, the ground set of items is often so large that even the widely used (lazy) greedy algorithm is not efficient enough. As a remedy, we introduce the problem of sublinear time probabilistic submodular maximization: Given training examples of functions (e.g., via user feature vectors), we seek to reduce the ground set so that optimizing new functions drawn from the same distribution will provide almost as much value when restricted to the reduced ground set as when using the full set. We cast this problem as a two-stage submodular maximization and develop a novel efficient algorithm for this problem which offers $1/2(1 - 1/e^2)$ approximation ratio for general monotone submodular functions and general matroid constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world applications where running the maximization problem on the reduced ground set leads to two orders of magnitude speed-up while incurring almost no loss",

However, data from many real world applications involve ordered categorical variables also known as ordinal variables, e.g., movie ratings on Netflix which can be ordered from 1 to 5 stars. With respect to univariate ordinal distributions, as we detail in the paper, there are two main categories of distributions; while there have been efforts to extend these to multivariate ordinal distributions, the resulting distributions are typically very complex, with either a large number of parameters, or with non-convex likelihoods. While there have been some work on tractable approximations, these do not come with strong statistical guarantees, and moreover are relatively computationally expensive. In this paper, we theoretically investigate two classes of graphical models for ordinal data, corresponding to the two main categories of univariate ordinal distributions.

At each round, nature prepares a context, a cost for each arm, and additionally a risk for each arm. The learner leverages the context to pull an arm and receives the corresponding cost and risk associated with the pulled arm. In addition to minimizing the cumulative cost, for safety purposes, the learner needs to make safe decisions such that the average of the cumulative risk from all pulled arms should not be larger than a pre-defined threshold. To address this problem, we first study online convex programming in the full information setting where in each round the learner receives an adversarial convex loss and a convex constraint. We develop a meta algorithm leveraging online mirror descent for the full information setting and then extend it to contextual bandit with sequential risk constraints setting using expert advice. Our algorithms can achieve near-optimal regret in terms of minimizing the total cost, while successfully maintaining a sub-linear growth of accumulative risk constraint violation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, researchers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on sequential prediction problems using deep neural networks and Reinforcement Learning (RL). For some of these problems, oracles that can demonstrate good performance may be available during training, but are not used by plain RL methods. To take advantage of this extra information, we propose AggreVaTeD, an extension of the Imitation Learning (IL) approach of Ross \\& Bagnell (2014). AggreVaTeD allows us to use expressive differentiable policy representations such as deep networks, while leveraging training-time oracles to achieve faster and more accurate solutions with less training data. Specifically, we present two gradient procedures that can learn neural network policies for several problems, including a sequential prediction task and several high-dimensional robotics control problems. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical study of IL that demonstrates that we can expect up to exponentially-lower sample complexity for learning with AggreVaTeD than with plain RL algorithms. Our results and theory indicate that IL (and AggreVaTeD in particular) can be a more effective strategy for sequential prediction than plain RL",

Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator.

We then extend this naive algorithm in two ways: we show that applying a structured random rotation before quantization reduces the error to $\\mathcal{O}((\\log d)/n)$ and a better coding strategy further reduces the error to $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$. We also show that the latter coding strategy is optimal up to a constant in the minimax sense i.e., it achieves the best MSE for a given communication cost.

Hierarchical forecasting require not only good prediction accuracy at each level of the hierarchy, but also the coherency between different levels — the property that forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. A fundamental limitation of prior research is the focus on forecasting the mean of each time series. We consider the situation where probabilistic forecasts are needed for each series in the hierarchy, and propose an algorithm to compute predictive distributions rather than mean forecasts only. Our algorithm has the advantage of synthesizing information from different levels in the hierarchy through a sparse forecast combination and a probabilistic hierarchical aggregation.

First, we prove that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (\"out-of-plane\") are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize in-plane critical-point-free regions for two-ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to $\\mathbf{w}^*$ for one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least $(1-\\epsilon)/2$ probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by $O(\\epsilon/\\sqrt{d})$, in accordance with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence towards $\\mathbf{w}^*$ (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics.

The framework gives a natural derivation of the optimal estimator that can be interpreted as a special case of the likelihood-ratio method so that we can evaluate the optimal degree of practical techniques with it. It bridges the likelihood-ratio method and the reparameterization trick while still supporting discrete variables. It is derived from the exchange property of the differentiation and integration. To be more specific, it is derived by the reparameterization trick and local marginalization analogous to the local expectation gradient.

When this assumption is violated, as is, e.g., in the case of hyperplanes, existing methods are either computationally too intensive (e.g., algebraic methods) or lack sufficient theoretical support (e.g., K-Hyperplanes or RANSAC). In this paper we provide theoretical and algorithmic contributions to the problem of clustering data from a union of hyperplanes, by extending a recent subspace learning method called Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) to the multi-hyperplane case. We give theoretical guarantees under which, the non-convex $\\ell_1$ problem associated with DPCP admits a unique global minimizer equal to the normal vector of the most dominant hyperplane. Inspired by this insight, we propose sequential (RANSAC-style) and iterative (K-Hyperplanes-style) hyperplane learning DPCP algorithms, which, via experiments on synthetic and real data, are shown to outperform or be competitive to the state-of-the-art",

In this work, we propose a novel approach based on group testing to solve such large multilabel classification problems with sparse label vectors. We describe various group testing constructions, and advocate the use of concatenated Reed Solomon codes and unbalanced bipartite expander graphs for extreme classification problems. The proposed approach has several advantages theoretically and practically over existing popular methods. Our method operates on the binary alphabet and can utilize the well-established binary classifiers for learning. The error correction capabilities of the codes are leveraged for the first time in the learning problem to correct prediction errors. Even if a linearly growing number of classifiers mis-classify, these errors are fully corrected. We establish Hamming loss error bounds for the approach. More importantly, our method utilizes a simple prediction algorithm and does not require matrix inversion or solving optimization problems making the algorithm very inexpensive.

    "abstract": "A data-driven identification of dynamical systems requiring only minimal prior knowledge is promising whenever no analytically derived model structure is available, e.g., from first principles in physics. However, meta-knowledge on the system's behavior is often given and should be exploited: Stability as fundamental property is essential when the model is used for controller design or movement generation. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for learning stable stochastic systems from data. We focus on identifying a state-dependent coefficient form of the nonlinear stochastic model which is globally asymptotically stable according to probabilistic Lyapunov methods. We compare our approach to other state of the art methods on real-world datasets in terms of flexibility and stability",

    "abstract": "Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a family of probabilistic models that have a repulsive behavior, and lend themselves naturally to many tasks in machine learning where returning a diverse set of objects is important. While there are fast algorithms for sampling, marginalization and conditioning, much less is known about learning the parameters of a DPP. Our contribution is twofold: (i) we establish the optimal sample complexity achievable in this problem and show that it is governed by a natural parameter, which we call the cycle sparsity; (ii) we propose a provably fast combinatorial algorithm that implements the method of moments efficiently and achieves optimal sample complexity.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A common practice in statistics and machine learning is to assume that the statistical data types (e.g., ordinal, categorical or real-valued) of variables, and usually also the likelihood model, is known. However, as the availability of real-world data increases, this assumption becomes too restrictive. Data are often heterogeneous, complex, and improperly or incompletely documented. Surprisingly, despite their practical importance, there is still a lack of tools to automatically discover the statistical types of, as well as appropriate likelihood (noise) models for, the variables in a dataset. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing a Bayesian method, which accurately discovers the statistical data types in both synthetic and real data",

We give a corresponding monotone, submodular surrogate function, and show that it is a good approximation to the original IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit an existing social network, while simultaneously learning the factors governing information propagation. For this, we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent analysis shows that our regret bound has a better (as compared to previous work) dependence on the size of the network.

Our approach is inspired by the feudal reinforcement learning proposal of Dayan and Hinton, and gains power and efficacy by decoupling end-to-end learning across multiple levels – allowing it to utilise different resolutions of time. Our framework employs a Manager module and a Worker module. The Manager operates at a slower time scale and sets abstract goals which are conveyed to and enacted by the Worker. The Worker generates primitive actions at every tick of the environment. The decoupled structure of FuN conveys several benefits – in addition to facilitating very long timescale credit assignment it also encourages the emergence of sub-policies associated with different goals set by the Manager. These properties allow FuN to dramatically outperform a strong baseline agent on tasks that involve long-term credit assignment or memorisation",

When this type of training is used, the computational cost does not depend on the number of data instances N. Furthermore, extra assumptions in the approximate inference process make the memory cost independent of N. The consequence is that the proposed EP method can be used on datasets with millions of instances. We compare empirically this method with alternative approaches that approximate the required computations using variational inference. The results show that it performs similar or even better than these techniques, which sometimes give significantly worse predictive distributions in terms of the test log-likelihood.

To avoid inherent compounding errors in recursive pixel-level prediction, we propose to first estimate high-level structure in the input frames, then predict how that structure evolves in the future, and finally by observing a single frame from the past and the predicted high-level structure, we construct the future frames without having to observe any of the pixel-level predictions. Long-term video prediction is difficult to perform by recurrently observing the predicted frames because the small errors in pixel space exponentially amplify as predictions are made deeper into the future. Our approach prevents pixel-level error propagation from happening by removing the need to observe the predicted frames. Our model is built with a combination of LSTM and analogy based encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks, which independently predict the video structure and generate the future frames, respectively. In experiments, our model is evaluated on the Human3.6M and Penn Action datasets on the task of long-term pixel-level video prediction of humans performing actions and demonstrate significantly better results than the state-of-the-art",

The vanishing or exploding gradient problem is a well known issue associated with these challenges. One approach to addressing vanishing and exploding gradients is to use either soft or hard constraints on weight matrices so as to encourage or enforce orthogonality. Orthogonal matrices preserve gradient norm during backpropagation and may therefore be a desirable property. This paper explores issues with optimization convergence, speed and gradient stability when encouraging or enforcing orthogonality. To perform this analysis, we propose a weight matrix factorization and parameterization strategy through which we can bound matrix norms and therein control the degree of expansivity induced during backpropagation. We find that hard constraints on orthogonality can negatively affect the speed of convergence and model performance",

The bound is matched up to constants by the inverse propensity scoring (IPS) and doubly robust (DR) estimators. This highlights the difficulty of the agnostic contextual setting, in contrast with multi-armed bandits and contextual bandits with access to a consistent reward model, where IPS is suboptimal. We then propose the SWITCH estimator, which can use an existing reward model (not necessarily consistent) to achieve a better bias-variance tradeoff than IPS and DR.

Because they spread mass agnostically at each step in an iterative manner, they can sometimes spread mass \"too aggressively,\" thereby failing to find the \"right\" clusters. We introduce a novel Capacity Releasing Diffusion (CRD) Process, which is both faster and stays more local than the classical spectral diffusion process. As an application, we use our CRD Process to develop an improved local algorithm for graph clustering. Our local graph clustering method can find local clusters in a model of clustering where one begins the CRD Process in a cluster whose vertices are connected better internally than externally by an $O(\\log^2 n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the cluster. Thus, our CRD Process is the first local graph clustering algorithm that is not subject to the well-known quadratic Cheeger barrier. Our result requires a certain smoothness condition, which we expect to be an artifact of our analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates improved results, in particular for realistic social graphs where there are moderately good—but not very good—clusters",

    "abstract": "We address the statistical and optimization impacts of using classical sketch versus Hessian sketch to solve approximately the Matrix Ridge Regression (MRR) problem. Prior research has considered the effects of classical sketch on least squares regression (LSR), a strictly simpler problem. We establish that classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR as it does on those of LSR—namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. In contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the \"mass\" in the responses and the optimal objective value. For both types of approximations, the regularization in the sketched MRR problem gives it significantly different statistical properties from the sketched LSR problem. In particular, there is a bias-variance trade-off in sketched MRR that is not present in sketched LSR. We provide upper and lower bounds on the biases and variances of sketched MRR; these establish that the variance is significantly increased when classical sketches are used, while the bias is significantly increased when using Hessian sketches. Empirically, sketched MRR solutions can have risks that are higher by an order-of-magnitude than those of the optimal MRR solutions. We establish theoretically and empirically that model averaging greatly decreases this gap. Thus, in the distributed setting, sketching combined with model averaging is a powerful technique that quickly obtains near-optimal solutions to the MRR problem while greatly mitigating the statistical risks incurred by sketching",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown extraordinary performance in a number of applications, but they are usually of heavy design for the accuracy reason. Beyond compressing the filters in CNNs, this paper focuses on the redundancy in the feature maps derived from the large number of filters in a layer. We propose to extract intrinsic representation of the feature maps and preserve the discriminability of the features. Circulant matrix is employed to formulate the feature map transformation, which only requires O(dlog d) computation complexity to embed a d-dimensional feature map. The filter is then re-configured to establish the mapping from original input to the new compact feature map, and the resulting network can preserve intrinsic information of the original network with significantly fewer parameters, which not only decreases the online memory for launching CNN but also accelerates the computation speed. Experiments on benchmark image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods",

Based upon the mild restricted strong convexity and smoothness conditions, we derive a projected notion of the restricted Lipschitz continuous gradient property, and prove that our algorithm enjoys linear convergence rate to the unknown low-rank matrix with an improved computational complexity. Moreover, our algorithm can be employed to both noiseless and noisy observations, where the (near) optimal sample complexity and statistical rate can be attained respectively.

In this paper, we study different approaches based on Gaussian process models to solve the multi-source transfer regression problem.

We theoretically show that using such a transfer covariance function for general Gaussian process modelling can only capture the same similarity coefficient for all the sources, and thus may result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. This leads us to propose TC$_{MS}$Stack, an integrated strategy incorporating the benefits of the transfer covariance function and stacking.

In this paper, however, we propose a Latent Intention Dialogue Model that employs a discrete latent variable to learn underlying dialogue intentions in the framework of neural variational inference. Additionally, in a goal-oriented dialogue scenario, the latent intentions can be interpreted as actions guiding the generation of machine responses, which can be further refined autonomously by reinforcement learning. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of discrete latent variable models on learning goal-oriented dialogues, and the results outperform the published benchmarks on both corpus-based evaluation and human evaluation",

Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an inability to scale to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to new tasks. We introduce a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead. We achieve this by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture, with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented with additional architectural features that mirror the known structure of optimization tasks. We also develop a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse, optimization tasks capturing common properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform RMSProp/ADAM on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably or better when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no neural networks in its meta-training set.

However, standard inference algorithms do not apply to these models due to the infinite support of the latent variables. Winner and Sheldon (2016) recently developed a new technique using probability generating functions (PGFs) to perform efficient, exact inference for certain Poisson latent variable models. However, the method relies on symbolic manipulation of PGFs, and it is unclear whether this can be extended to more general models. In this paper we introduce a new approach for inference with PGFs: instead of manipulating PGFs symbolically, we adapt techniques from the autodiff literature to compute the higher-order derivatives necessary for inference. This substantially generalizes the class of models for which efficient, exact inference algorithms are available. Specifically, our results apply to a class of models that includes branching processes, which are widely used in applied mathematics and population ecology, and autoregressive models for integer data.

In this paper, we propose a unified margin view to revisit eleven performance measures in multi-label classification.

Several recent studies investigate a new type of regularization approach, which encourages components in LSMs to be diverse, for the sake of alleviating overfitting. While they have shown promising empirical effectiveness, in theory why larger \"diversity\" results in less overfitting is still unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose a new diversity-promoting approach that is both theoretically analyzable and empirically effective. Specifically, we use near-orthogonality to characterize \"diversity\" and impose angular constraints (ACs) on the components of LSMs to promote diversity. A generalization error analysis shows that larger diversity results in smaller estimation error and larger approximation error. An efficient ADMM algorithm is developed to solve the constrained LSM problems. Experiments demonstrate that ACs improve generalization performance of LSMs and outperform other diversity-promoting approaches",

In light of the limitations of existing approaches, we design a new diversity-promoting regularizer by considering two factors: uncorrelation and evenness, which encourage the components to be uncorrelated and to play equally important roles in modeling data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a new theory is developed for first-order stochastic convex optimization, showing that the global convergence rate is sufficiently quantified by a local growth rate of the objective function in a neighborhood of the optimal solutions. In particular, if the objective function $F(\\mathbf{w})$ in the $\\epsilon$-sublevel set grows as fast as $\\|\\mathbf{w} - \\mathbf{w}_*\\|_2^{1/\\theta}$, where $\\mathbf{w}_*$ represents the closest optimal solution to $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\theta\\in(0,1]$ quantifies the local growth rate, the iteration complexity of first-order stochastic optimization for achieving an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution can be $\\widetilde O(1/\\epsilon^{2(1-\\theta)})$, which is optimal at most up to a logarithmic factor. This result is fundamentally better in contrast with the previous works that either assume a global growth condition in the entire domain or achieve a local faster convergence under the local faster growth condition. To achieve the faster global convergence, we develop two different accelerated stochastic subgradient methods by iteratively solving the original problem approximately in a local region around a historical solution with the size of the local region gradually decreasing as the solution approaches the optimal set. Besides the theoretical improvements, this work also include new contributions towards making the proposed algorithms practical: (i) we present practical variants of accelerated stochastic subgradient methods that can run without the knowledge of multiplicative growth constant and even the growth rate $\\theta$; (ii) we consider a broad family of problems in machine learning to demonstrate that the proposed algorithms enjoy faster convergence than traditional stochastic subgradient method. For example, when applied to the $\\ell_1$ regularized empirical polyhedral loss minimization (e.g., hinge loss, absolute loss), the proposed stochastic methods have a logarithmic iteration complexity",

    "abstract": "Most learning approaches treat dimensionality reduction (DR) and clustering separately (i.e., sequentially), but recent research has shown that optimizing the two tasks jointly can substantially improve the performance of both. The premise behind the latter genre is that the data samples are obtained via linear transformation of latent representations that are easy to cluster; but in practice, the transformation from the latent space to the data can be more complicated. In this work, we assume that this transformation is an unknown and possibly nonlinear function. To recover the `clustering-friendly' latent representations and to better cluster the data, we propose a joint DR and K-means clustering approach in which DR is accomplished via learning a deep neural network (DNN). The motivation is to keep the advantages of jointly optimizing the two tasks, while exploiting the deep neural network's ability to approximate any nonlinear function. This way, the proposed approach can work well for a broad class of generative models. Towards this end, we carefully design the DNN structure and the associated joint optimization criterion, and propose an effective and scalable algorithm to handle the formulated optimization problem.

To solve a cardinality constrained problem, the key challenge is to solve the projection onto the cardinality constraint set, which is NP-hard in general when there exist multiple overlapped cardinality constraints. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the overlapped cardinality constraints satisfy a Three-view Cardinality Structure (TVCS), which reflects the natural restriction in many applications, such as identification of gene regulatory networks and task-worker assignment problem. We cast the projection into a linear programming, and show that for TVCS, the vertex solution of this linear programming is the solution for the original projection problem. We further prove that such solution can be found with the complexity proportional to the number of variables and constraints. We finally use synthetic experiments and two interesting applications in bioinformatics and crowdsourcing to validate the proposed TVCS model and method",

In this paper, we experiment with a new type of decoder for VAE: a dilated CNN. By changing the decoder's dilation architecture, we control the size of context from previously generated words. In experiments, we find that there is a trade-off between contextual capacity of the decoder and effective use of encoding information. We show that when carefully managed, VAEs can outperform LSTM language models. We demonstrate perplexity gains on two datasets, representing the first positive language modeling result with VAE. Further, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the use of VAE (with our new decoding architecture) for semi-supervised and unsupervised labeling tasks, demonstrating gains over several strong baselines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants have shown promising performances in sequence modeling tasks such as Natural Language Processing. These models, however, turn out to be impractical and difficult to train when exposed to very high-dimensional inputs due to the large input-to-hidden weight matrix. This may have prevented RNNs' large-scale application in tasks that involve very high input dimensions such as video modeling; current approaches reduce the input dimensions using various feature extractors. To address this challenge, we propose a new, more general and efficient approach by factorizing the input-to-hidden weight matrix using Tensor-Train decomposition which is trained simultaneously with the weights themselves. We test our model on classification tasks using multiple real-world video datasets and achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art models, even though our model architecture is orders of magnitude less complex. We believe that the proposed approach provides a novel and fundamental building block for modeling high-dimensional sequential data with RNN architectures and opens up many possibilities to transfer the expressive and advanced architectures from other domains such as NLP to modeling high-dimensional sequential data",

    "title": "A Richer Theory of Convex Constrained Optimization with Reduced Projections and Improved Rates",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper focuses on convex constrained optimization problems, where the solution is subject to a convex inequality constraint. In particular, we aim at challenging problems for which both projection into the constrained domain and a linear optimization under the inequality constraint are time-consuming, which render both projected gradient methods and conditional gradient methods (a.k.a. the Frank-Wolfe algorithm) expensive. In this paper, we develop projection reduced optimization algorithms for both smooth and non-smooth optimization with improved convergence rates under a certain regularity condition of the constraint function. We first present a general theory of optimization with only one projection. Its application to smooth optimization with only one projection yields $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iteration complexity, which improves over the $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ iteration complexity established before for non-smooth optimization and can be further reduced under strong convexity. Then we introduce a local error bound condition and develop faster algorithms for non-strongly convex optimization at the price of a logarithmic number of projections. In particular, we achieve an iteration complexity of $\\widetilde O(1/\\epsilon^{2(1-\\theta)})$ for non-smooth optimization and $\\widetilde O(1/\\epsilon^{1-\\theta})$ for smooth optimization, where $\\theta\\in(0,1]$ appearing the local error bound condition characterizes the functional local growth rate around the optimal solutions. Novel applications in solving the constrained $\\ell_1$ minimization problem and a positive semi-definite constrained distance metric learning problem demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speed-up compared with previous algorithms",

    "abstract": "Imposing sparse + group-sparse superposition structures in high-dimensional parameter estimation is known to provide flexible regularization that is more realistic for many real-world problems. For example, such a superposition enables partially-shared support sets in multi-task learning, thereby striking the right balance between parameter overlap across tasks and task specificity. Existing theoretical results on estimation consistency, however, are problematic as they require too stringent an assumption: the incoherence between sparse and group-sparse superposed components. In this paper, we fill the gap between the practical success and suboptimal analysis of sparse + group-sparse models, by providing the first consistency results that do not require unrealistic assumptions. We also study non-convex counterparts of sparse + group-sparse models. Interestingly, we show that these are guaranteed to recover the true support set under much milder conditions and with smaller sample size than convex models, which might be critical in practical applications as illustrated by our experiments",

Instead of using greedy splitting and pruning like decision tree algorithms, we aim to fully optimize over rule lists, striking a practical balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational speed. The algorithm presented here uses a mixture of theoretical bounds (tight enough to have practical implications as a screening or bounding procedure), computational reuse, and highly tuned language libraries to achieve computational efficiency.

Other efficient stochastic second order methods are also proposed. However, the convergence properties of these methods are still not well understood. There are also several important gaps between the current convergence theory and performance in real applications. In this paper, we aim to fill these gaps.

Despite being conceptually simple, WLM problems are computationally challenging because they involve minimizing over functions of quantities (i.e. Wasserstein distances) that themselves require numerical algorithms to compute. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic approach based on simulated annealing for solving WLMs. Particularly, we have developed a Gibbs sampler to approximate effectively and efficiently the partial gradients of a sequence of Wasserstein losses. Our new approach has the advantages of numerical stability and readiness for warm starts. These characteristics are valuable for WLM problems that often require multiple levels of iterations in which the oracle for computing the value and gradient of a loss function is embedded. We applied the method to optimal transport with Coulomb cost and the Wasserstein non-negative matrix factorization problem, and made comparisons with the existing method of entropy regularization",

Thus, each instance has an associated latent binary feature incidence vector indicating the presence or absence of a feature. Due to its combinatorial nature, inference of LFMs is considerably intractable, and accordingly, most of the attention has focused on nonparametric LFMs, with priors such as the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) on infinite binary matrices. Recent efforts to tackle this complexity either still have computational complexity that is exponential, or sample complexity that is high-order polynomial w.r.t. the number of latent features. In this paper, we address this outstanding problem of tractable estimation of LFMs via a novel atomic-norm regularization, which gives an algorithm with polynomial run-time and sample complexity without impractical assumptions on the data distribution",

To resolve this issue, we propose a sparsity regularization method that exploits both positive and negative correlations among the features to enforce the network to be sparse, and at the same time remove any redundancies among the features to fully utilize the capacity of the network. Specifically, we propose to use an exclusive sparsity regularization based on (1,2)-norm, which promotes competition for features between different weights, thus enforcing them to fit to disjoint sets of features. We further combine the exclusive sparsity with the group sparsity based on (2,1)-norm, to promote both sharing and competition for features in training of a deep neural network. We validate our method on multiple public datasets, and the results show that our method can obtain more compact and efficient networks while also improving the performance over the base networks with full weights, as opposed to existing sparsity regularizations that often obtain efficiency at the expense of prediction accuracy",

However, to generalize across different user types, LSTMs require a large number of parameters, notwithstanding the simplicity of the underlying dynamics, rendering it uninterpretable, which is highly undesirable in user modeling. The increase in complexity and parameters arises due to a large action space in which many of the actions have similar intent or topic. In this paper, we introduce Latent LSTM Allocation (LLA) for user modeling combining hierarchical Bayesian models with LSTMs. In LLA, each user is modeled as a sequence of actions, and the model jointly groups actions into topics and learns the temporal dynamics over the topic sequence, instead of action space directly. This leads to a model that is highly interpretable, concise, and can capture intricate dynamics. We present an efficient Stochastic EM inference algorithm for our model that scales to millions of users/documents.

It has achieved great successes in many real-world applications. However, for large-scale problems involving a huge number of samples and extremely high-dimensional features, solving sparse SVMs remains challenging. By noting that sparse SVMs induce sparsities in both feature and sample spaces, we propose a novel approach, which is based on accurate estimations of the primal and dual optima of sparse SVMs, to simultaneously identify the features and samples that are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the outputs. Thus, we can remove the identified inactive samples and features from the training phase, leading to substantial savings in both the memory usage and computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first static feature and sample reduction method for sparse SVMs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets (e.g., the kddb dataset with about 20 million samples and 30 million features) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and the speedup gained by our approach can be orders of magnitude",

We validate our framework across a range of applications, and show that it enables an FPGA prototype that is up to $6.5\\times$ faster than an implementation using full 32-bit precision. We further develop a variance-optimal stochastic quantization strategy and show that it can make a significant difference in a variety of settings.

This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic approach that incorporates various kinds of node attributes encoded in binary form in relational models with Poisson likelihood. Our method works flexibly with both directed and undirected relational networks. The inference can be done by efficient Gibbs sampling which leverages sparsity of both networks and node attributes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently low displacement rank (LDR) matrices, or so-called structured matrices, have been proposed to compress large-scale neural networks. Empirical results have shown that neural networks with weight matrices of LDR matrices, referred as LDR neural networks, can achieve significant reduction in space and computational complexity while retaining high accuracy. This paper gives theoretical study on LDR neural networks. First, we prove the universal approximation property of LDR neural networks with a mild condition on the displacement operators. We then show that the error bounds of LDR neural networks are as efficient as general neural networks with both single-layer and multiple-layer structure. Finally, we propose back-propagation based training algorithm for general LDR neural networks",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been shown to be very successful at learning feature hierarchies in supervised learning tasks. Generative models, on the other hand, have benefited less from hierarchical models with multiple layers of latent variables. In this paper, we prove that hierarchical latent variable models do not take advantage of the hierarchical structure when trained with existing variational methods, and provide some limitations on the kind of features existing models can learn. Finally we propose an alternative architecture that do not suffer from these limitations.

    "abstract": "Deep networks are highly nonlinear and difficult to optimize. During training, the parameter iterate may move from one local basin to another, or the data distribution may even change. Inspired by the close connection between stochastic optimization and online learning, we propose a variant of the follow the regularized leader (FTRL) algorithm called follow the moving leader (FTML). Unlike the FTRL family of algorithms, the recent samples are weighted more heavily in each iteration and so FTML can adapt more quickly to changes. We show that FTML enjoys the nice properties of RMSprop and Adam, while avoiding their pitfalls. Experimental results on a number of deep learning models and tasks demonstrate that FTML converges quickly, and outperforms other state-of-the-art optimizers",

    "abstract": "With the fast development of deep learning, it has become common to learn big neural networks using massive training data. Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (ASGD) is widely adopted to fulfill this task for its efficiency, which is, however, known to suffer from the problem of delayed gradients. That is, when a local worker adds its gradient to the global model, the global model may have been updated by other workers and this gradient becomes \"delayed\". We propose a novel technology to compensate this delay, so as to make the optimization behavior of ASGD closer to that of sequential SGD. This is achieved by leveraging Taylor expansion of the gradient function and efficient approximators to the Hessian matrix of the loss function. We call the new algorithm Delay Compensated ASGD (DC-ASGD). We evaluated the proposed algorithm on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that DC-ASGD outperforms both synchronous SGD and asynchronous SGD, and nearly approaches the performance of sequential SGD",

For the high-dimensional world, we discover that under $\\ell_2$-norm assumption on data points, high-dimensional sparse linear regression and mean estimation can be achieved with logarithmic dependence on dimension, using random projection and approximate recovery.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider regression problems with one-hidden-layer neural networks (1NNs). We distill some properties of activation functions that lead to local strong convexity in the neighborhood of the ground-truth parameters for the 1NN squared-loss objective and most popular nonlinear activation functions satisfy the distilled properties, including rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs, squared ReLUs and sigmoids. For activation functions that are also smooth, we show local linear convergence guarantees of gradient descent under a resampling rule. For homogeneous activations, we show tensor methods are able to initialize the parameters to fall into the local strong convexity region. As a result, tensor initialization followed by gradient descent is guaranteed to recover the ground truth with sample complexity $ d \\cdot \\log(1/\\epsilon) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k,\\lambda )$ and computational complexity $n\\cdot d \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k,\\lambda) $ for smooth homogeneous activations with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension of the input, $k$ ($k\\leq d$) is the number of hidden nodes, $\\lambda$ is a conditioning property of the ground-truth parameter matrix between the input layer and the hidden layer, $\\epsilon$ is the targeted precision and $n$ is the number of samples.

    "abstract": "Many studies in biomedical and health sciences involve small sample sizes due to logistic or financial constraints. Often, identifying weak (but scientifically interesting) associations between a set of predictors and a response necessitates pooling datasets from multiple diverse labs or groups. While there is a rich literature in statistical machine learning to address distributional shifts and inference in multi-site datasets, it is less clear when such pooling is guaranteed to help (and when it does not) – independent of the inference algorithms we use. In this paper, we present a hypothesis test to answer this question, both for classical and high dimensional linear regression. We precisely identify regimes where pooling datasets across multiple sites is sensible, and how such policy decisions can be made via simple checks executable on each site before any data transfer ever happens. With a focus on Alzheimer's disease studies, we present empirical results showing that in regimes suggested by our analysis, pooling a local dataset with data from an international study improves power",

Compared with existing high-dimensional EM algorithms, our algorithm enjoys a better computational complexity and is therefore more efficient. We apply our generic algorithm to two illustrative latent variable models: Gaussian mixture model and mixture of linear regression, and demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm by both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments.
