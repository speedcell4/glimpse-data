    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a novel generalized zero-shot algorithm to recognize perceived emotions from gestures. Our task is to map gestures to novel emotion categories not encountered in training. We introduce an adversarial autoencoder-based representation learning that correlates 3D motion-captured gesture sequences with the vectorized representation of the natural-language perceived emotion terms using word2vec embeddings. The language-semantic embedding provides a representation of the emotion label space, and we leverage this underlying distribution to map the gesture sequences to the appropriate categorical emotion labels. We train our method using a combination of gestures annotated with known emotion terms and gestures not annotated with any emotions. We evaluate our method on the MPI Emotional Body Expressions Database (EBEDB) and obtain an accuracy of 58.43%. We see an improvement in performance compared to current state-of-the-art algorithms for generalized zero-shot learning by an absolute 25-27%. We also demonstrate our approach on publicly available online videos and movie scenes, where the actors' pose has been extracted and map to their respective emotive states",

    "title": "Optimized Potential Initialization for Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been attached great importance due to the distinctive properties of low power consumption, biological plausibility, and adversarial robustness. The most effective way to train deep SNNs is through ANN-to-SNN conversion, which have yielded the best performance in deep network structure and large-scale datasets. However, there is a trade-off between accuracy and latency. In order to achieve high precision as original ANNs, a long simulation time is needed to match the firing rate of a spiking neuron with the activation value of an analog neuron, which impedes the practical application of SNN. In this paper, we aim to achieve high-performance converted SNNs with extremely low latency (fewer than 32 time-steps). We start by theoretically analyzing ANN-to-SNN conversion and show that scaling the thresholds does play a similar role as weight normalization. Instead of introducing constraints that facilitate ANN-to-SNN conversion at the cost of model capacity, we applied a more direct way by optimizing the initial membrane potential to reduce the conversion loss in each layer. Besides, we demonstrate that optimal initialization of membrane potentials can implement expected error-free ANN-to-SNN conversion. We evaluate our algorithm on the CIFAR-10 dataset and CIFAR-100 dataset and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, using fewer time-steps. For example, we reach top-1 accuracy of 93.38% on CIFAR-10 with 16 time-steps. Moreover, our method can be applied to other ANN-SNN conversion methodologies and remarkably promote performance when the time-steps is small",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We revisit the planning problem in the blocks world, and we implement a known heuristic for this task. Importantly, our implementation is biologically plausible, in the sense that it is carried out exclusively through the spiking of neurons. Even though much has been accomplished in the blocks world over the past five decades, we believe that this is the first algorithm of its kind. The input is a sequence of symbols encoding an initial set of block stacks as well as a target set, and the output is a sequence of motion commands such as \"put the top block in stack 1 on the table\". The program is written in the Assembly Calculus, a recently proposed computational framework meant to model computation in the brain by bridging the gap between neural activity and cognitive function. Its elementary objects are assemblies of neurons (stable sets of neurons whose simultaneous firing signifies that the subject is thinking of an object, concept, word, etc.), its commands include project and merge, and its execution model is based on widely accepted tenets of neuroscience. A program in this framework essentially sets up a dynamical system of neurons and synapses that eventually, with high probability, accomplishes the task. The purpose of this work is to establish empirically that reasonably large programs in the Assembly Calculus can execute correctly and reliably; and that rather realistic --- if idealized --- higher cognitive functions, such as planning in the blocks world, can be implemented successfully by such programs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cognitive processing signals can be used to improve natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is not clear how these signals correlate with linguistic information. Bridging between human language processing and linguistic features has been widely studied in neurolinguistics, usually via single-variable controlled experiments with highly-controlled stimuli. Such methods not only compromises the authenticity of natural reading, but also are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to investigate the relationship between cognitive processing signals and linguistic features. Specifically, we present a unified attentional framework that is composed of embedding, attention, encoding and predicting layers to selectively map cognitive processing signals to linguistic features. We define the mapping procedure as a bridging task and develop 12 bridging tasks for lexical, syntactic and semantic features. The proposed framework only requires cognitive processing signals recorded under natural reading as inputs, and can be used to detect a wide range of linguistic features with a single cognitive dataset. Observations from experiment results resonate with previous neuroscience findings. In addition to this, our experiments also reveal a number of interesting findings, such as the correlation between contextual eye-tracking features and tense of sentence",

    "abstract": "With the help of deep neural networks (DNNs), deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved great success on many complex tasks, from games to robotic control. Compared to DNNs with partial brain-inspired structures and functions, spiking neural networks (SNNs) consider more biological features, including spiking neurons with complex dynamics and learning paradigms with biologically plausible plasticity principles. Inspired by the efficient computation of cell assembly in the biological brain, whereby memory-based coding is much more complex than readout, we propose a multiscale dynamic coding improved spiking actor network (MDC-SAN) for reinforcement learning to achieve effective decision-making. The population coding at the network scale is integrated with the dynamic neurons coding (containing 2nd-order neuronal dynamics) at the neuron scale towards a powerful spatial-temporal state representation. Extensive experimental results show that our MDC-SAN performs better than its counterpart deep actor network (based on DNNs) on four continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym. We think this is a significant attempt to improve SNNs from the perspective of efficient coding towards effective decision-making, just like that in biological networks",

    "abstract": "Despite the advances in multi-person pose estimation, state-of-the-art techniques only deliver the human pose structure.Yet, they do not leverage the keypoints of human pose to deliver whole-body shape information for human instance segmentation. This paper presents PosePlusSeg, a joint model designed for both human pose estimation and instance segmentation. For pose estimation, PosePlusSeg first takes a bottom-up approach to detect the soft and hard keypoints of individuals by producing a strong keypoint heat map, then improves the keypoint detection confidence score by producing a body heat map. For instance segmentation, PosePlusSeg generates a mask offset where keypoint is defined as a centroid for the pixels in the embedding space, enabling instance-level segmentation for the human class. Finally, we propose a new pose and instance segmentation algorithm that enables PosePlusSeg to determine the joint structure of the human pose and instance segmentation. Experiments using the COCO challenging dataset demonstrate that PosePlusSeg copes better with challenging scenarios, like occlusions, en-tangled limbs, and overlapped people. PosePlusSeg outperforms state-of-the-art detection-based approaches achieving a 0.728 mAP for human pose estimation and a 0.445 mAP for instance segmentation.

    "abstract": "With the increasing demands for understanding the internal behaviors of deep networks, Explainable AI (XAI) has been made remarkable progress in interpreting the model's decision. A family of attribution techniques has been proposed, highlighting whether the input pixels are responsible for the model's prediction. However, the existing attribution methods suffer from the lack of rule guidance and require further human interpretations. In this paper, we construct the 'if-then' logic rules that are sufficiently precise locally. Moreover, a novel rule-guided method, dynamic ablation (DA), is proposed to find a minimal bound sufficient in an input image to justify the network's prediction and aggregate iteratively to reach a complete attribution. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed DA. We demonstrate the advantages of our method in providing clear and explicit explanations that are also easy for human experts to understand. Besides, through the attribution on a series of trained networks with different architectures, we show that more complex networks require less information to make a specific prediction",

Given a video stream of point cloud observation of an articulated body under arbitrary motion, our approach discovers the unknown low-dimensional skeletal relationship that can effectively represent the movement. Then the discovered structure is utilized to encode the motion priors of dynamic sequences in a latent structure, which can be decoded to the relative joint rotations to represent the full skeletal motion. Our approach works without any prior knowledge of the underlying motion or skeletal structure, and we demonstrate that the discovered structure is even comparable to the hand-labeled ground truth skeleton in representing a 4D sequence of motion. The skeletal structure embeds the general semantics of possible motion space that can generate motions for diverse scenarios. We verify that the learned motion prior is generalizable to the multi-modal sequence generation, interpolation of two poses, and motion retargeting to a different skeletal structure",

In this paper, we propose a deformable part region learning in order to allow decomposed part regions to be deformable according to geometric transformation of an object. To this end, we introduce trainable geometric parameters for the location of each part model. Because the ground truth of the part models is not available, we design classification and mask losses for part models, and learn the geometric parameters by minimizing an integral loss including those part losses. As a result, we can train a deformable part region network without extra super-vision and make each part model deformable according to object scale variation. Furthermore, for improving cascade object detection and instance segmentation, we present a Cascade deformable part region architecture which can refine whole and part detections iteratively in the cascade manner. Without bells and whistles, our implementation of a Cascade deformable part region detector achieves better detection and segmentation mAPs on COCO and VOC datasets, compared to the recent cascade and other state-of-the-art detectors",

Instead of placing an existing Transformer-based image classification model directly after an image codec, we aim to redesign the Vision Transformer (ViT) model to perform image classification from the compressed features and facilitate image compression with the long-term information from the Transformer. Specifically, we first replace the patchify stem (i.e., image splitting and embedding) of the ViT model with a lightweight image encoder modelled by a convolutional neural network. The compressed features generated by the image encoder are injected convolutional inductive bias and are fed to the Transformer for image classification bypassing image reconstruction. Meanwhile, we propose a feature aggregation module to fuse the compressed features with the selected intermediate features of the Transformer, and feed the aggregated features to a deconvolutional neural network for image reconstruction. The aggregated features can obtain the long-term information from the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer and improve the compression performance. The rate-distortion-accuracy optimization problem is finally solved by a two-step training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in both the image compression and the classification tasks",

    "abstract": "Handwritten mathematical expression recognition aims to automatically generate LaTeX sequences from given images. Currently, attention-based encoder-decoder models are widely used in this task. They typically generate target sequences in a left-to-right (L2R) manner, leaving the right-to-left (R2L) contexts unexploited. In this paper, we propose an Attention aggregation based Bi-directional Mutual learning Network (ABM) which consists of one shared encoder and two parallel inverse decoders (L2R and R2L). The two decoders are enhanced via mutual distillation, which involves one-to-one knowledge transfer at each training step, making full use of the complementary information from two inverse directions. Moreover, in order to deal with mathematical symbols in diverse scales, an Attention Aggregation Module (AAM) is proposed to effectively integrate multi-scale coverage attentions. Notably, in the inference phase, given that the model already learns knowledge from two inverse directions, we only use the L2R branch for inference, keeping the original parameter size and inference speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the recognition accuracy of 56.85 % on CROHME 2014, 52.92 % on CROHME 2016, and 53.96 % on CROHME 2019 without data augmentation and model ensembling, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we discuss a promising solution to the Open-set Long-Tailed Recognition (OLTR) task utilizing metric learning. Firstly, we propose a distribution-sensitive loss, which weighs more on the tail classes to decrease the intra-class distance in the feature space. Building upon these concentrated feature clusters, a local-density-based metric is introduced, called Localizing Unfamiliarity Near Acquaintance (LUNA), to measure the novelty of a testing sample. LUNA is flexible with different cluster sizes and is reliable on the cluster boundary by considering neighbors of different properties. Moreover, contrary to most of the existing works that alleviate the open-set detection as a simple binary decision, LUNA is a quantitative measurement with interpretable meanings.

    "abstract": "We proposed a Prior Gradient Mask Guided Pruning-aware Fine-Tuning (PGMPF) framework to accelerate deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In detail, the proposed PGMPF selectively suppresses the gradient of those \"unimportant\" parameters via a prior gradient mask generated by the pruning criterion during fine-tuning. PGMPF has three charming characteristics over previous works: (1) Pruning-aware network fine-tuning. A typical pruning pipeline consists of training, pruning and fine-tuning, which are relatively independent, while PGMPF utilizes a variant of the pruning mask as a prior gradient mask to guide fine-tuning, without complicated pruning criteria. (2) An excellent tradeoff between large model capacity during fine-tuning and stable convergence speed to obtain the final compact model. Previous works preserve more training information of pruned parameters during fine-tuning to pursue better performance, which would incur catastrophic non-convergence of the pruned model for relatively large pruning rates, while our PGMPF greatly stabilizes the fine-tuning phase by gradually constraining the learning rate of those \"unimportant\" parameters. (3) Channel-wise random dropout of the prior gradient mask to impose some gradient noise to fine-tuning to further improve the robustness of final compact model. Experimental results on three image classification benchmarks CIFAR10/ 100 and ILSVRC-2012 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for various CNN architectures, datasets and pruning rates. Notably, on ILSVRC-2012, PGMPF reduces 53.5% FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.90% top-1 accuracy drop and 0.52% top-5 accuracy drop, which has advanced the state-of-the-art with negligible extra computational cost",

Object detectors take a holistic view of the image and the detection of one object (or lack thereof) often depends on other objects in the scene. This makes such detectors inherently context-aware and adversarial attacks in this space are more challenging than those targeting image classifiers. In this paper, we present a new approach to generate context-aware attacks for object detectors. We show that by using co-occurrence of objects and their relative locations and sizes as context information, we can successfully generate targeted mis-categorization attacks that achieve higher transfer success rates on blackbox object detectors than the state-of-the-art. We test our approach on a variety of object detectors with images from PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets and demonstrate up to 20 percentage points improvement in performance compared to the other state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "OoDHDR-Codec: Out-of-Distribution Generalization for HDR Image Compression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning has been proven to be a promising approach in standard dynamic range (SDR) image compression. However, due to the wide luminance distribution of high dynamic range (HDR) images and the lack of large standard datasets, developing a deep model for HDR image compression is much more challenging. To tackle this issue, we view HDR data as distributional shifts of SDR data and the HDR image compression can be modeled as an out-of-distribution generalization (OoD) problem. Herein, we propose a novel out-of-distribution (OoD) HDR image compression framework (OoDHDR-codec). It learns the general representation across HDR and SDR environments, and allows the model to be trained effectively using a large set of SDR datases supplemented with much fewer HDR samples. Specifically, OoDHDR-codec consists of two branches to process the data from two environments. The SDR branch is a standard blackbox network. For the HDR branch, we develop a hybrid system that models luminance masking and tone mapping with white-box modules and performs content compression with black-box neural networks. To improve the generalization from SDR training data on HDR data, we introduce an invariance regularization term to learn the common representation for both SDR and HDR compression. Extensive experimental results show that the OoDHDR codec achieves strong competitive in-distribution performance and state-of-the-art OoD performance. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed approach is the first work to model HDR compression as OoD generalization problems and our OoD generalization algorithmic framework can be applied to any deep compression model in addition to the network architectural choice demonstrated in the paper.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning techniques have been extensively studied for pansharpening, which aims to generate a high resolution multispectral (HRMS) image by fusing a low resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with a high resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. However, existing deep learning-based pansharpening methods directly learn the mapping from LRMS and PAN to HRMS. These network architectures always lack sufficient interpretability, which limits further performance improvements. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel deep network for pansharpening by combining the model-based methodology with the deep learning method. Firstly, we build an observation model for pansharpening using the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) technique and design a proximal gradient algorithm to solve this model. Secondly, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a deep network, dubbed as Proximal PanNet, by learning the proximal operators using convolutional neural networks. Finally, all the learnable modules can be automatically learned in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on some benchmark datasets show that our network performs better than other advanced methods both quantitatively and qualitatively",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed DEtection TRansformer (DETR) achieves promising performance for end-to-end object detection. However, it has relatively lower detection performance on small objects and suffers from slow convergence. This paper observed that DETR performs surprisingly well even on small objects when measuring Average Precision (AP) at decreased Intersection-over-Union (IoU) thresholds. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple way to improve DETR by refining the coarse features and predicted locations. Specifically, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CF) decoder layer constituted of a coarse layer and a carefully designed fine layer. Within each CF decoder layer, the extracted local information (region of interest feature) is introduced into the flow of global context information from the coarse layer to refine and enrich the object query features via the fine layer. In the fine layer, the multi-scale information can be fully explored and exploited via the Adaptive Scale Fusion(ASF) module and Local Cross-Attention (LCA) module. The multi-scale information can also be enhanced by another proposed Transformer Enhanced FPN (TEF) module to further improve the performance. With our proposed framework (named CF-DETR), the localization accuracy of objects (especially for small objects) can be largely improved. As a byproduct, the slow convergence issue of DETR can also be addressed. The effectiveness of CF-DETR is validated via extensive experiments on the coco benchmark. CF-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance among end-to-end detectors, e.g., achieving 47.8 AP using ResNet-50 with 36 epochs in the standard 3x training schedule",

When estimating a texture map, a single image is insufficient as it reveals only one facet of a 3D object. To provide sufficient information for estimating a complete texture map, the proposed model simultaneously generates multi-view hallucinations in the image domain and an estimated texture map in the texture domain. During the generating process, each domain generator exchanges features to the other by a flow-based local attention mechanism. In this manner, the proposed model can estimate a texture map utilizing abundant multi-view image features from which multiview hallucinations are generated. As a result, the estimated texture map contains consistent colors and patterns over the entire region. Experiments show the superiority of our model for estimating a directly render-able texture map, which is applicable to 3D animation rendering.

    "abstract": "Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to build a structured representation of a scene using objects and pairwise relationships, which benefits downstream tasks. However, current SGG methods usually suffer from sub-optimal scene graph generation because of the long-tailed distribution of training data. To address this problem, we propose Resistance Training using Prior Bias (RTPB) for the scene graph generation. Specifically, RTPB uses a distributed-based prior bias to improve models' detecting ability on less frequent relationships during training, thus improving the model generalizability on tail categories. In addition, to further explore the contextual information of objects and relationships, we design a contextual encoding backbone network, termed as Dual Transformer (DTrans). We perform extensive experiments on a very popular benchmark, VG150, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the unbiased scene graph generation. In specific, our RTPB achieves an improvement of over 10% under the mean recall when applied to current SGG methods.

    "abstract": "Although point-based networks are demonstrated to be accurate for 3D point cloud modeling, they are still falling behind their voxel-based competitors in 3D detection. We observe that the prevailing set abstraction design for down-sampling points may maintain too much unimportant background information that can affect feature learning for detecting objects. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel set abstraction method named Semantics-Augmented Set Abstraction (SASA). Technically, we first add a binary segmentation module as the side output to help identify foreground points. Based on the estimated point-wise foreground scores, we then propose a semantics-guided point sampling algorithm to help retain more important foreground points during down-sampling. In practice, SASA shows to be effective in identifying valuable points related to foreground objects and improving feature learning for point-based 3D detection. Additionally, it is an easy-to-plug-in module and able to boost various point-based detectors, including single-stage and two-stage ones. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI and nuScenes datasets validate the superiority of SASA, lifting point-based detection models to reach comparable performance to state-of-the-art voxel-based methods.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection aims to automatically identify unusual objects or behaviours by learning from normal videos. Previous methods tend to use simplistic reconstruction or prediction constraints, which leads to the insufficiency of learned representations for normal data. As such, we propose a novel bi-directional architecture with three consistency constraints to comprehensively regularize the prediction task from pixel-wise, cross-modal, and temporal-sequence levels. First, predictive consistency is proposed to consider the symmetry property of motion and appearance in forwards and backwards time, which ensures the highly realistic appearance and motion predictions at the pixel-wise level. Second, association consistency considers the relevance between different modalities and uses one modality to regularize the prediction of another one. Finally, temporal consistency utilizes the relationship of the video sequence and ensures that the predictive network generates temporally consistent frames. During inference, the pattern of abnormal frames is unpredictable and will therefore cause higher prediction errors.

Existing methods are mostly based on convolutional neural networks~(CNNs), whose building blocks either process local neighbor pixels at a time, or, when 3D convolutions are used to model temporal information, suffer from the misalignment problem caused by person movement. In this paper, we propose to overcome the limitations of normal convolutions with a human-oriented graph method. Specifically, features located at person joint keypoints are extracted and connected as a spatial-temporal graph. These keypoint features are then updated by message passing from their connected nodes with a graph convolutional network~(GCN). During training, the GCN can be attached to any CNN-based person re-ID model to assist representation learning on feature maps, whilst it can be dropped after training for better inference speed. Our method brings significant improvements over the CNN-based baseline model on the MARS dataset with generated person keypoints and a newly annotated dataset: PoseTrackReID.

    "abstract": "Temporal action detection aims to locate the boundaries of action in the video. The current method based on boundary matching enumerates and calculates all possible boundary matchings to generate proposals. However, these methods neglect the long-range context aggregation in boundary prediction. At the same time, due to the similar semantics of adjacent matchings, local semantic aggregation of densely-generated matchings cannot improve semantic richness and discrimination. In this paper, we propose the end-to-end proposal generation method named Dual Context Aggregation Network (DCAN) to aggregate context on two levels, namely, boundary level and proposal level, for generating high-quality action proposals, thereby improving the performance of temporal action detection. Specifically, we design the Multi-Path Temporal Context Aggregation (MTCA) to achieve smooth context aggregation on boundary level and precise evaluation of boundaries. For matching evaluation, Coarse-to-fine Matching (CFM) is designed to aggregate context on the proposal level and refine the matching map from coarse to fine. We conduct extensive experiments on ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS-14. DCAN obtains an average mAP of 35.39% on ActivityNet v1.3 and reaches mAP 54.14% at IoU@0.5 on THUMOS-14, which demonstrates DCAN can generate high-quality proposals and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

However, such comprehensive annotation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. On the other hand, it is much easier and less cost to annotate images with scene graphs, so we investigate leveraging annotated images to facilitate training a scene graph generation model for unannotated videos, namely image-to-video scene graph generation. This task presents two challenges: 1) infer unseen dynamic relationships in videos from static relationships in images due to the absence of motion information in images; 2) adapt objects and static relationships from images to video frames due to the domain shift between them. To address the first challenge, we exploit external commonsense knowledge to infer the unseen dynamic relationship from the temporal evolution of static relationships. We tackle the second challenge by hierarchical adversarial learning to reduce the data distribution discrepancy between images and video frames.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, the blossom of deep learning has witnessed the rapid development of scene text recognition. However, the recognition of low-resolution scene text images remains a challenge. Even though some super-resolution methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, they usually treat text images as general images while ignoring the fact that the visual quality of strokes (the atomic unit of text) plays an essential role for text recognition. According to Gestalt Psychology, humans are capable of composing parts of details into the most similar objects guided by prior knowledge. Likewise, when humans observe a low-resolution text image, they will inherently use partial stroke-level details to recover the appearance of holistic characters. Inspired by Gestalt Psychology, we put forward a Stroke-Aware Scene Text Image Super-Resolution method containing a Stroke-Focused Module (SFM) to concentrate on stroke-level internal structures of characters in text images. Specifically, we attempt to design rules for decomposing English characters and digits at stroke-level, then pre-train a text recognizer to provide stroke-level attention maps as positional clues with the purpose of controlling the consistency between the generated super-resolution image and high-resolution ground truth. The extensive experimental results validate that the proposed method can indeed generate more distinguishable images on TextZoom and manually constructed Chinese character dataset Degraded-IC13. Furthermore, since the proposed SFM is only used to provide stroke-level guidance when training, it will not bring any time overhead during the test phase.

To overcome these limitations, we propose in this paper a new generative adversarial network (MvInvert) for natural face self-occlusion recovery without using paired image-texture data. We design a coarse-to-fine generator for photorealistic texture generation. A coarse texture is computed by inpainting the invisible areas in the photorealistic but incomplete texture sampled directly from the 2D image using the unrealistic but complete statistical texture from 3DMM. Then, we design a multi-view Residual-based GAN Inversion, which re-renders and refines multi-view 2D images, which are used for extracting multiple high-fidelity textures. Finally, these high-fidelity textures are fused based on their visibility maps via Poisson blending. To perform adversarial learning to assure the quality of the recovered texture, we design a discriminator consisting of two heads, i.e., one for global and local discrimination between the recovered texture and a small set of real textures in UV space, and the other for discrimination between the input image and the re-rendered 2D face images via pixel-wise, identity, and adversarial losses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in face self-occlusion recovery under unconstrained scenarios",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) can asynchronously output the events reflecting apparent motion of objects with microsecond resolution, and shows great application potential in monitoring and other fields. However, the output event stream of existing DVS inevitably contains background activity noise (BA noise) due to dark current and junction leakage current, which will affect the temporal correlation of objects, resulting in deteriorated motion estimation performance. Particularly, the existing filter-based denoising methods cannot be directly applied to suppress the noise in event stream, since there is no spatial correlation. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel progressive framework, in which a Motion Estimation (ME) module and an Event Denoising (ED) module are jointly optimized in a mutually reinforced manner. Specifically, based on the maximum sharpness criterion, ME module divides the input event into several segments by adaptive clustering in a motion compensating warp field, and captures the temporal correlation of event stream according to the clustered motion parameters. Taking temporal correlation as guidance, ED module calculates the confidence that each event belongs to real activity events, and transmits it to ME module to update energy function of motion segmentation for noise suppression. The two steps are iteratively updated until stable motion segmentation results are obtained. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approaches against the State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods",

    "title": "Attacking Video Recognition Models with Bullet-Screen Comments",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent research has demonstrated that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial patches which introduce perceptible but localized changes to the input. Nevertheless, existing approaches have focused on generating adversarial patches on images, their counterparts in videos have been less explored. Compared with images, attacking videos is much more challenging as it needs to consider not only spatial cues but also temporal cues. To close this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial attack in this paper, the bullet-screen comment (BSC) attack, which attacks video recognition models with BSCs. Specifically, adversarial BSCs are generated with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, where the environment is set as the target model and the agent plays the role of selecting the position and transparency of each BSC. By continuously querying the target models and receiving feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its selection strategies in order to achieve a high fooling rate with non-overlapping BSCs. As BSCs can be regarded as a kind of meaningful patch, adding it to a clean video will not affect people's understanding of the video content, nor will arouse people's suspicion. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. On both UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets, our BSC attack method can achieve about 90% fooling rate when attacking three mainstream video recognition models, while only occluding < 8% areas in the video.

    "abstract": "Invariance to diverse types of image corruption, such as noise, blurring, or colour shifts, is essential to establish robust models in computer vision. Data augmentation has been the major approach in improving the robustness against common corruptions. However, the samples produced by popular augmentation strategies deviate significantly from the underlying data manifold. As a result, performance is skewed toward certain types of corruption. To address this issue, we propose a multi-source vicinal transfer augmentation (VITA) method for generating diverse on-manifold samples. The proposed VITA consists of two complementary parts: tangent transfer and integration of multi-source vicinal samples. The tangent transfer creates initial augmented samples for improving corruption robustness. The integration employs a generative model to characterize the underlying manifold built by vicinal samples, facilitating the generation of on-manifold samples. Our proposed VITA significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art augmentation methods, demonstrated in extensive experiments on corruption benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes by transferring semantic knowledge from seen classes to unseen ones. Semantic knowledge is learned from attribute descriptions shared between different classes, which are strong prior for localization of object attribute for representing discriminative region features enabling significant visual-semantic interaction. Although few attention-based models have attempted to learn such region features in a single image, the transferability and discriminative attribute localization of visual features are typically neglected. In this paper, we propose an attribute-guided Transformer network to learn the attribute localization for discriminative visual-semantic embedding representations in ZSL, termed TransZero. Specifically, TransZero takes a feature augmentation encoder to alleviate the cross-dataset bias between ImageNet and ZSL benchmarks and improve the transferability of visual features by reducing the entangled relative geometry relationships among region features. To learn locality-augmented visual features, TransZero employs a visual-semantic decoder to localize the most relevant image regions to each attributes from a given image under the guidance of attribute semantic information. Then, the locality-augmented visual features and semantic vectors are used for conducting effective visual-semantic interaction in a visual-semantic embedding network. Extensive experiments show that TransZero achieves a new state-of-the-art on three ZSL benchmarks. The codes are available at: https://github.com/shiming-chen/TransZero",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental yet practical task because real-world images inherently possess multiple semantic labels. However, it is difficult to collect large-scale multi-label annotations due to the complexity of both the input images and output label spaces. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a structured semantic transfer (SST) framework that enables training multi-label recognition models with partial labels, i.e., merely some labels are known while other labels are missing (also called unknown labels) per image. The framework consists of two complementary transfer modules that explore within-image and cross-image semantic correlations to transfer knowledge of known labels to generate pseudo labels for unknown labels. Specifically, an intra-image semantic transfer module learns image-specific label co-occurrence matrix and maps the known labels to complement unknown labels based on this matrix. Meanwhile, a cross-image transfer module learns category-specific feature similarities and helps complement unknown labels with high similarities. Finally, both known and generated labels are used to train the multi-label recognition models. Extensive experiments on the Microsoft COCO, Visual Genome and Pascal VOC datasets show that the proposed SST framework obtains superior performance over current state-of-the-art algorithms.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vehicle re-identification (ReID) has attracted considerable attention in computer vision. Although several methods have been proposed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this topic, re-identifying vehicle in foggy scenes remains a great challenge due to the degradation of visibility. To our knowledge, this problem is still not well-addressed so far. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel training framework called Semi-supervised Joint Defogging Learning (SJDL) framework. First, the fog removal branch and the re-identification branch are integrated to perform simultaneous training. With the collaborative training scheme, defogged features generated by the defogging branch from input images can be shared to learn better representation for the re-identification branch. However, since the fog-free image of real-world data is intractable, this architecture can only be trained on the synthetic data, which may cause the domain gap problem between real-world and synthetic scenarios. To solve this problem, we design a semi-supervised defogging training scheme that can train two kinds of data alternatively in each iteration. Due to the lack of a dataset specialized for vehicle ReID in the foggy weather, we construct a dataset called FVRID which consists of real-world and synthetic foggy images to train and evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and outperforms other existing vehicle ReID methods in the foggy weather.

    "abstract": "Real-world data often follows a long-tailed distribution, which makes the performance of existing classification algorithms degrade heavily. A key issue is that the samples in tail categories fail to depict their intra-class diversity. Humans can imagine a sample in new poses, scenes and view angles with their prior knowledge even if it is the first time to see this category. Inspired by this, we propose a novel reasoning-based implicit semantic data augmentation method to borrow transformation directions from other classes. Since the covariance matrix of each category represents the feature transformation directions, we can sample new directions from similar categories to generate definitely different instances. Specifically, the long-tailed distributed data is first adopted to train a backbone and a classifier. Then, a covariance matrix for each category is estimated, and a knowledge graph is constructed to store the relations of any two categories. Finally, tail samples are adaptively enhanced via propagating information from all the similar categories in the knowledge graph.

Current state-of-the-art OCC models learn a compact normality description by hyper-sphere minimisation, but they often suffer from overfitting the training data, especially when the training set is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. To address this issue, we introduce the interpolated Gaussian descriptor (IGD) method, a novel OCC model that learns a one-class Gaussian anomaly classifier trained with adversarially interpolated training samples. The Gaussian anomaly classifier differentiates the training samples based on their distance to the Gaussian centre and the standard deviation of these distances, offering the model a discriminability w.r.t. the given samples during training. The adversarial interpolation is enforced to consistently learn a smooth Gaussian descriptor, even when the training data is small or contaminated with anomalous samples. This enables our model to learn the data description based on the representative normal samples rather than fringe or anomalous samples, resulting in significantly improved normality description. In extensive experiments on diverse popular benchmarks, including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CIFAR10, MVTec AD and two medical datasets, IGD achieves better detection accuracy than current state-of-the-art models.

Specifically, TIN can extract thumbnail features' normalization statistics and apply them to small patches, ensuring the style consistency among different patches. Overall, the URST framework has three merits compared to prior arts. (1) We divide input image into small patches and adopt TIN, successfully transferring image style with arbitrary high-resolution. (2) Experiments show that our URST surpasses existing SOTA methods on ultra-high resolution images benefiting from the effectiveness of the proposed stroke perceptual loss in enlarging the stroke size.

    "title": "PureGaze: Purifying Gaze Feature for Generalizable Gaze Estimation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Gaze estimation methods learn eye gaze from facial features. However, among rich information in the facial image, real gaze-relevant features only correspond to subtle changes in eye region, while other gaze-irrelevant features like illumination, personal appearance and even facial expression may affect the learning in an unexpected way. This is a major reason why existing methods show significant performance degradation in cross-domain/dataset evaluation. In this paper, we tackle the cross-domain problem in gaze estimation. Different from common domain adaption methods, we propose a domain generalization method to improve the cross-domain performance without touching target samples. The domain generalization is realized by gaze feature purification. We eliminate gaze-irrelevant factors such as illumination and identity to improve the cross-domain performance. We design a plug-and-play self-adversarial framework for the gaze feature purification. The framework enhances not only our baseline but also existing gaze estimation methods directly and significantly. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose domain generalization methods in gaze estimation. Our method achieves not only state-of-the-art performance among typical gaze estimation methods but also competitive results among domain adaption methods.

    "title": "(2.5+1)D Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs for Video Question Answering",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal scene-graph approaches to video-based reasoning tasks, such as video question-answering (QA), typically construct such graphs for every video frame. These approaches often ignore the fact that videos are essentially sequences of 2D ``views'' of events happening in a 3D space, and that the semantics of the 3D scene can thus be carried over from frame to frame. Leveraging this insight, we propose a (2.5+1)D scene graph representation to better capture the spatio-temporal information flows inside the videos. Specifically, we first create a 2.5D (pseudo-3D) scene graph by transforming every 2D frame to have an inferred 3D structure using an off-the-shelf 2D-to-3D transformation module, following which we register the video frames into a shared (2.5+1)D spatio-temporal space and ground each 2D scene graph within it. Such a (2.5+1)D graph is then segregated into a static sub-graph and a dynamic sub-graph, corresponding to whether the objects within them usually move in the world. The nodes in the dynamic graph are enriched with motion features capturing their interactions with other graph nodes. Next, for the video QA task, we present a novel transformer-based reasoning pipeline that embeds the (2.5+1)D graph into a spatio-temporal hierarchical latent space, where the sub-graphs and their interactions are captured at varied granularity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present experiments on the NExT-QA and AVSD-QA datasets. Our results show that our proposed (2.5+1)D representation leads to faster training and inference, while our hierarchical model showcases superior performance on the video QA task versus the state of the art",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Event cameras asynchronously output the polarity values of pixel-level log intensity alterations. They are robust against motion blur and can be adopted in challenging light conditions. Owing to these advantages, event cameras have been employed in various vision tasks such as depth estimation, visual odometry, and object detection. In particular, event cameras are effective in stereo depth estimation to ﬁnd correspondence points between two cameras under challenging illumination conditions and/or fast motion. However, because event cameras provide spatially sparse event stream data, it is difﬁcult to obtain a dense disparity map. Although it is possible to estimate disparity from event data at the edge of a structure where intensity changes are likely to occur, estimating the disparity in a region where event occurs rarely is challenging. In this study, we propose a deep network that combines the features of an image with the features of an event to generate a dense disparity map. The proposed network uses images to obtain spatially dense features that are lacking in events. In addition, we propose a spatial multi-scale correlation between two fused feature maps for an accurate disparity map. To validate our method, we conducted experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, various image-to-image translation (I2I) methods have improved mode diversity and visual quality in terms of neural networks or regularization terms. However, conventional I2I methods relies on a static decision boundary and the encoded representations in those methods are entangled with each other, so they often face with ‘mode collapse' phenomenon. To mitigate mode collapse, 1) we design a so-called style-guided discriminator that guides an input image to the target image style based on the strategy of flexible decision boundary. 2) Also, we make the encoded representations include independent domain attributes. Based on two ideas, this paper proposes Style-Guided and Disentangled Representation for Robust Image-to-Image Translation (SRIT). SRIT showed outstanding FID by 8%, 22.8%, and 10.1% for CelebA-HQ, AFHQ, and Yosemite datasets, respectively. The translated images of SRIT reflect the styles of target domain successfully. This indicates that SRIT shows better mode diversity than previous works",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation(SFUDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to the original labeled source domain samples. Many existing SFUDA approaches apply the self-training strategy, which involves iteratively selecting confidently predicted target samples as pseudo-labeled samples used to train the model to fit the target domain. However, the self-training strategy may also suffer from sample selection bias and be impacted by the label noise of the pseudo-labeled samples. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on how these two issues affect the model generalization ability when applying the self-training strategy for the SFUDA problem. Based on this theoretical analysis, we then propose a new Denoised Maximum Classifier Discrepancy (D-MCD) method for SFUDA to effectively address these two issues. In particular, we first minimize the distribution mismatch between the selected pseudo-labeled samples and the remaining target domain samples to alleviate the sample selection bias. Moreover, we design a strong-weak self-training paradigm to denoise the selected pseudo-labeled samples, where the strong network is used to select pseudo-labeled samples while the weak network helps the strong network to filter out hard samples to avoid incorrect labels. In this way, we are able to ensure both the quality of the pseudo-labels and the generalization ability of the trained model on the target domain. We achieve state-of-the-art results on three domain adaptation benchmark datasets, which clearly validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Digital cameras transform sensor RAW readings into RGB images by means of their Image Signal Processor (ISP). Computational photography tasks such as image denoising and colour constancy are commonly performed in the RAW domain, in part due to the inherent hardware design, but also due to the appealing simplicity of noise statistics that result from the direct sensor readings. Despite this, the availability of RAW images is limited in comparison with the abundance and diversity of available RGB data. Recent approaches have attempted to bridge this gap by estimating the RGB to RAW mapping: handcrafted model-based methods that are interpretable and controllable usually require manual parameter fine-tuning, while end-to-end learnable neural networks require large amounts of training data, at times with complex training procedures, and generally lack interpretability and parametric control. Towards addressing these existing limitations, we present a novel hybrid model-based and data-driven ISP that builds on canonical ISP operations and is both learnable and interpretable. Our proposed invertible model, capable of bidirectional mapping between RAW and RGB domains, employs end-to-end learning of rich parameter representations, i.e. dictionaries, that are free from direct parametric supervision and additionally enable simple and plausible data augmentation. We evidence the value of our data generation process by extensive experiments under both RAW image reconstruction and RAW image denoising tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance in both. Additionally, we show that our ISP can learn meaningful mappings from few data samples, and that denoising models trained with our dictionary-based data augmentation are competitive despite having only few or zero ground-truth labels",

This paper presents a tailor-made multi-camera based motion averaging system, where the fixed relative poses are utilized to improve the accuracy and robustness of SfM. Our approach starts by dividing the images into reference images and non-reference images, and edges in view-graph are divided into four categories accordingly. Then, a multi-camera based rotating averaging problem is formulated and solved in two stages, where an iterative re-weighted least squares scheme is used to deal with outliers. Finally, a multi-camera based translation averaging problem is formulated and a l1-norm based optimization scheme is proposed to compute the relative translations of multi-camera system and reference camera positions simultaneously. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm achieves superior accuracy and robustness on various data sets compared to the state-of-the-art methods",

Specifically, we design GenCo, a Generative Co-training network that mitigates the discriminator over-fitting issue by introducing multiple complementary discriminators that provide diverse supervision from multiple distinctive views in training. We instantiate the idea of GenCo in two ways. The first way is Weight-Discrepancy Co-training (WeCo) which co-trains multiple distinctive discriminators by diversifying their parameters. The second way is Data-Discrepancy Co-training (DaCo) which achieves co-training by feeding discriminators with different views of the input images. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that GenCo achieves superior generation with limited training data. In addition, GenCo also complements the augmentation approach with consistent and clear performance gains when combined",

This procedure is well-defined and solved for planar images, while it is challenging for spherical ones. Some existing methods utilize planar bounding boxes to represent spherical objects. However, they are biased due to the distortions of spherical objects. Others use spherical rectangles as unbiased representations, but they adopt excessive approximate algorithms when computing the IoU. In this paper, we propose an unbiased IoU as a novel evaluation criterion for spherical image object detection, which is based on the unbiased representations and utilize unbiased analytical method for IoU calculation. This is the first time that the absolutely accurate IoU calculation is applied to the evaluation criterion, thus object detection algorithms can be correctly evaluated for spherical images. With the unbiased representation and calculation, we also present Spherical CenterNet, an anchor free object detection algorithm for spherical images. The experiments show that our unbiased IoU gives accurate results and the proposed Spherical CenterNet achieves better performance on one real-world and two synthetic spherical object detection datasets than existing methods",

We find that fine-tuning using the recently developed self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, such as SimCLR and MoCo, fails to improve the performance of instance retrieval.

To overcome this problem, we propose InsCLR, a new SSL method that builds on the instance-level contrast, to learn the intra-class invariance by dynamically mining meaningful pseudo positive samples from both mini-batches and a memory bank during training.

Another line of research that utilizes Spiking Neural Network suffers from training issues for deeper architecture. To address these points, a novel input representation is proposed that captures the events temporal distribution for signal enhancement. Moreover, we introduce a spatio-temporal recurrent encoding-decoding neural network architecture for event-based optical flow estimation, which utilizes Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units to extract feature maps from a series of event images. Besides, our architecture allows some traditional frame-based core modules, such as correlation layer and iterative residual refine scheme, to be incorporated.

However, intrinsic defects in most of the current methods with FPN make it difficult to adapt to the feature of different geometric objects.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial in many practical applications due to the diversity of pedestrian movements, such as social interactions and individual motion behaviors. With similar observable trajectories and social environments, different pedestrians may make completely different future decisions. However, most existing methods only focus on the frequent modal of the trajectory and thus are difficult to generalize to the peculiar scenario, which leads to the decline of the multimodal fitting ability when facing similar scenarios. In this paper, we propose a complementary attention gated network (CAGN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction, in which a dual-path architecture including normal and inverse attention is proposed to capture both frequent and peculiar modals in spatial and temporal patterns, respectively. Specifically, a complementary block is proposed to guide normal and inverse attention, which are then be summed with learnable weights to get attention features by a gated network. Finally, multiple trajectory distributions are estimated based on the fused spatio-temporal attention features due to the multimodality of future trajectory. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, i.e., the ETH, and the UCY, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 13.8% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 10.4% in Final Displacement Error (FDE).

Many interpretation methods help to understand the decision-making of DNNs by generating saliency maps that highlight parts of the input image that contribute the most to the prediction made by the DNN. In this paper we design a backdoor attack that alters the saliency map produced by the network for an input image with a specific trigger pattern while not losing the prediction performance significantly. The saliency maps are incorporated in the penalty term of the objective function that is used to train a deep model and its influence on model training is conditioned upon the presence of a trigger. We design two types of attacks: a targeted attack that enforces a specific modification of the saliency map and a non-targeted attack when the importance scores of the top pixels from the original saliency map are significantly reduced. We perform empirical evaluations of the proposed backdoor attacks on gradient-based interpretation methods, Grad-CAM and SimpleGrad, and a gradient-free scheme, VisualBackProp, for a variety of deep learning architectures. We show that our attacks constitute a serious security threat to the reliability of the interpretation methods when deploying models developed by untrusted sources. We furthermore show that existing backdoor defense mechanisms are ineffective in detecting our attacks. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in an inverted setting, where the correct saliency map can be obtained only in the presence of a trigger (key), effectively making the interpretation system available only to selected users",

    "abstract": "Transfer adversarial attack is a non-trivial black-box adversarial attack that aims to craft adversarial perturbations on the surrogate model and then apply such perturbations to the victim model. However, the transferability of perturbations from existing methods is still limited, since the adversarial perturbations are easily overﬁtting with a single surrogate model and speciﬁc data pattern. In this paper, we propose a Learning to Learn Transferable Attack (LLTA) method, which makes the adversarial perturbations more generalized via learning from both data and model augmentation. For data augmentation, we adopt simple random resizing and padding. For model augmentation, we randomly alter the back propagation instead of the forward propagation to eliminate the effect on the model prediction. By treating the attack of both speciﬁc data and a modiﬁed model as a task, we expect the adversarial perturbations to adopt enough tasks for generalization. To this end, the meta-learning algorithm is further introduced during the iteration of perturbation generation. Empirical results on the widely-used dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack method with a 12.85% higher success rate of transfer attack compared with the state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method on the real-world online system, i.e., Google Cloud Vision API, to further show the practical potentials of our method",

    "title": "Perceptual Quality Assessment of Omnidirectional Images",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Omnidirectional images, also called 360◦images, have attracted extensive attention in recent years, due to the rapid development of virtual reality (VR) technologies. During omnidirectional image processing including capture, transmission, consumption, and so on, measuring the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images is highly desired, since it plays a great role in guaranteeing the immersive quality of experience (IQoE). In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the perceptual quality of omnidirectional images from both subjective and objective perspectives. Specifically, we construct the largest so far subjective omnidirectional image quality database, where we consider several key influential elements, i.e., realistic non-uniform distortion, viewing condition, and viewing behavior, from the user view. In addition to subjective quality scores, we also record head and eye movement data. Besides, we make the first attempt by using the proposed database to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for blind omnidirectional image quality assessment. To be consistent with the human viewing behavior in the VR device, we extract viewports from each omnidirectional image and incorporate the user viewing conditions naturally in the proposed model. The proposed model is composed of two parts, including a multi-scale CNN-based feature extraction module and a perceptual quality prediction module. The feature extraction module is used to incorporate the multi-scale features, and the perceptual quality prediction module is designed to regress them to perceived quality scores. The experimental results on our database verify that the proposed model achieves the competing performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large capacity deep learning models are often prone to a high generalization gap when trained with a limited amount of labeled training data. A recent class of methods to address this problem uses various ways to construct a new training sample by mixing a pair (or more) of training samples. We propose PatchUp, a hidden state block-level regularization technique for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that is applied on selected contiguous blocks of feature maps from a random pair of samples. Our approach improves the robustness of CNN models against the manifold intrusion problem that may occur in other state-of-the-art mixing approaches. Moreover, since we are mixing the contiguous block of features in the hidden space, which has more dimensions than the input space, we obtain more diverse samples for training towards different dimensions. Our experiments on CIFAR10/100, SVHN, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet using ResNet architectures including PreActResnet18/34, WRN-28-10, ResNet101/152 models show that PatchUp improves upon, or equals, the performance of current state-of-the-art regularizers for CNNs. We also show that PatchUp can provide a better generalization to deformed samples and is more robust against adversarial attacks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing permutation-invariant methods can be divided into two categories according to the aggregation scope, i.e. global aggregation and local one. Although the global aggregation methods, e. g., PointNet and Deep Sets, get involved in simpler structures, their performance is poorer than the local aggregation ones like PointNet++ and Point Transformer. It remains an open problem whether there exists a global aggregation method with a simple structure, competitive performance, and even much fewer parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel global aggregation permutation-invariant network based on dual MLP dot-product, called DuMLP-Pin, which is capable of being employed to extract features for set inputs, including unordered or unstructured pixel, attribute, and point cloud data sets. We strictly prove that any permutation-invariant function implemented by DuMLP-Pin can be decomposed into two or more permutation-equivariant ones in a dot-product way as the cardinality of the given input set is greater than a threshold. We also show that the DuMLP-Pin can be viewed as Deep Sets with strong constraints under certain conditions. The performance of DuMLP-Pin is evaluated on several different tasks with diverse data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our DuMLP-Pin achieves the best results on the two classification problems for pixel sets and attribute sets. On both the point cloud classification and the part segmentation, the accuracy of DuMLP-Pin is very close to the so-far best-performing local aggregation method with only a 1-2% difference, while the number of required parameters is significantly reduced by more than 85% in classification and 69% in segmentation, respectively.

In this paper, we present A2 - an attention-aligned Transformer for image captioning, which guides attention learning in a perturbation-based self-supervised manner, without any annotation overhead. Specifically, we add mask operation on image regions through a learnable network to estimate the true function in ultimate description generation. We hypothesize that the necessary image region features, where small disturbance causes an obvious performance degradation, deserve more attention weight. Then, we propose four aligned strategies to use this information to refine attention weight distribution. Under such a pattern, image regions are attended correctly with the output words.

    "abstract": "Recently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has achieved excellent performance in the classification task. It is widely known that CNN is deemed as a 'blackbox', which is hard for understanding the prediction mechanism and debugging the wrong prediction. Some model debugging and explanation works are developed for solving the above drawbacks. However, those methods focus on explanation and diagnosing possible causes for model prediction, based on which the researchers handle the following optimization of models manually. In this paper, we propose the first completely automatic model diagnosing and treating tool, termed as Model Doctor. Based on two discoveries that 1) each category is only correlated with sparse and specific convolution kernels, and 2) adversarial samples are isolated while normal samples are successive in the feature space, a simple aggregate gradient constraint is devised for effectively diagnosing and optimizing CNN classifiers. The aggregate gradient strategy is a versatile module for mainstream CNN classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Model Doctor applies to all existing CNN classifiers, and improves the accuracy of 16 mainstream CNN classifiers by 1%~5%",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In point cloud compression, sufficient contexts are significant for modeling the point cloud distribution. However, the contexts gathered by the previous voxel-based methods decrease when handling sparse point clouds. To address this problem, we propose a multiple-contexts deep learning framework called OctAttention employing the octree structure, a memory-efficient representation for point clouds. Our approach encodes octree symbol sequences in a lossless way by gathering the information of sibling and ancestor nodes. Expressly, we first represent point clouds with octree to reduce spatial redundancy, which is robust for point clouds with different resolutions. We then design a conditional entropy model with a large receptive field that models the sibling and ancestor contexts to exploit the strong dependency among the neighboring nodes and employ an attention mechanism to emphasize the correlated nodes in the context. Furthermore, we introduce a mask operation during training and testing to make a trade-off between encoding time and performance. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art works, our approach obtains a 10%-35% BD-Rate gain on the LiDAR benchmark (e.g. SemanticKITTI) and object point cloud dataset (e.g. MPEG 8i, MVUB), and saves 95% coding time compared to the voxel-based baseline.

It remains challenging to restore such degraded images using deep neural networks since real-world paired data is scarcely available while synthetic paired data cannot approximate real-world data perfectly. In this paper, we propose an UnSupervised Underwater Image Restoration method (USUIR) by leveraging the homology property between a raw underwater image and a re-degraded image. Specifically, USUIR first estimates three latent components of the raw underwater image, i.e., the global background light, the transmission map, and the scene radiance (the clean image). Then, a re-degraded image is generated by randomly mixing up the estimated scene radiance and the raw underwater image. We demonstrate that imposing a homology constraint between the raw underwater image and the re-degraded image is equivalent to minimizing the restoration error and hence can be used for the unsupervised restoration. Extensive experiments show that USUIR achieves promising performance in both inference time and restoration quality",

    "abstract": "Large-scale pre-training has recently revolutionized vision-and-language (VL) research. Models such as LXMERT and UNITER have significantly lifted the state of the art over a wide range of VL tasks. However, the large number of parameters in such models hinders their application in practice. In parallel, work on the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) has shown that deep neural networks contain small matching subnetworks that can achieve on par or even better performance than the dense networks when trained in isolation. In this work, we perform the first empirical study to assess whether such trainable subnetworks also exist in pre-trained VL models. We use UNITER as the main testbed (also test on LXMERT and ViLT), and consolidate 7 representative VL tasks for experiments, including visual question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, visual entailment, referring expression comprehension, image-text retrieval, GQA, and NLVR2. Through comprehensive analysis, we summarize our main findings as follows. (i) It is difficult to find subnetworks that strictly match the performance of the full model. However, we can find relaxed winning tickets at 50%-70% sparsity that maintain 99% of the full accuracy. (ii) Subnetworks found by task-specific pruning transfer reasonably well to the other tasks, while those found on the pre-training tasks at 60%/70% sparsity transfer universally, matching 98%/96% of the full accuracy on average over all the tasks. (iii) Besides UNITER, other models such as LXMERT and ViLT can also play lottery tickets. However, the highest sparsity we can achieve for ViLT is far lower than LXMERT and UNITER (30% vs. 70%). (iv) LTH also remains relevant when using other training methods (e.g., adversarial training)",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks based single-image superresolution (SISR) has made great progress in recent years. However, it is difficult to apply these methods to real-world scenarios due to the computational and memory cost. Meanwhile, how to take full advantage of the intermediate features under the constraints of limited parameters and calculations is also a huge challenge. To alleviate these issues, we propose a lightweight yet efficient Feature Distillation Interaction Weighted Network (FDIWN). Specifically, FDIWN utilizes a series of specially designed Feature Shuffle Weighted Groups (FSWG) as the backbone, and several novel mutual Wide-residual Distillation Interaction Blocks (WDIB) form an FSWG. In addition, Wide Identical Residual Weighting (WIRW) units and Wide Convolutional Residual Weighting (WCRW) units are introduced into WDIB for better feature distillation. Moreover, a Wide-Residual Distillation Connection (WRDC) framework and a Self-Calibration Fusion (SCF) unit are proposed to interact features with different scales more flexibly and efficiently. Extensive experiments show that our FDIWN is superior to other models to strike a good balance between model performance and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/IVIPLab/FDIWN",

    "abstract": "Current state-of-the-art saliency detection models rely heavily on large datasets of accurate pixel-wise annotations, but manually labeling pixels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. There are some weakly supervised methods developed for alleviating the problem, such as image label, bounding box label, and scribble label, while point label still has not been explored in this field. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly-supervised salient object detection method using point supervision. To infer the saliency map, we first design an adaptive masked flood filling algorithm to generate pseudo labels. Then we develop a transformer-based point-supervised saliency detection model to produce the first round of saliency maps. However, due to the sparseness of the label, the weakly supervised model tends to degenerate into a general foreground detection model. To address this issue, we propose a Non-Salient Suppression (NSS) method to optimize the erroneous saliency maps generated in the first round and leverage them for the second round of training. Moreover, we build a new point-supervised dataset (P-DUTS) by relabeling the DUTS dataset. In P-DUTS, there is only one labeled point for each salient object. Comprehensive experiments on five largest benchmark datasets demonstrate our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods trained with the stronger supervision and even surpass several fully supervised state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "In real world, training data for person re-identification (Re-ID) is collected discretely with spatial and temporal variations, which requires a model to incrementally learn new knowledge without forgetting old knowledge. This problem is called lifelong person re-identification (LReID). Variations of illumination and background for images of each task exhibit task-specific image style and lead to task-wise domain gap. In addition to missing data from the old tasks, task-wise domain gap is a key factor for catastrophic forgetting in LReID, which is ignored in existing approaches for LReID. The model tends to learn task-specific knowledge with task-wise domain gap, which results in stability and plasticity dilemma. To overcome this problem, we cast LReID as a domain adaptation problem and propose a pseudo task knowledge preservation framework to alleviate the domain gap. Our framework is based on a pseudo task transformation module which maps the features of the new task into the feature space of the old tasks to complement the limited saved exemplars of the old tasks. With extra transformed features in the task-specific feature space, we propose a task-specific domain consistency loss to implicitly alleviate the task-wise domain gap for learning task-shared knowledge instead of task-specific one. Furthermore, to guide knowledge preservation with the feature distributions of the old tasks, we propose to preserve knowledge on extra pseudo tasks which jointly distills knowledge and discriminates identity, in order to achieve a better trade-off between stability and plasticity for lifelong learning with task-wise domain gap. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method as compared with the state-of-the-art lifelong learning and LReID methods",

The partial alignment task is extremely complex, as it jointly tries to match between points, and identify which points do not appear in the corresponding shape, causing the solution to be non-unique and ill-posed in most cases. Until now, two main methodologies have been suggested to solve this problem: sample a subset of points that are likely to have correspondences, or perform soft alignment between the point clouds and try to avoid a match to an occluded part. These heuristics work when the partiality is mild or when the transformation is small but fails for severe occlusions, or when outliers are present. We present a unique approach named Confidence Guided Distance Network (CGD-net), where we fuse learnable similarity between point embeddings and spatial distance between point clouds, inducing an optimized solution for the overlapping points while ignoring parts that only appear in one of the shapes. The point feature generation is done by a self-supervised architecture that repels far points to have different embeddings, therefore succeeds to align partial views of shapes, even with excessive internal symmetries, or acute rotations. We compare our network to recently presented learning-based and axiomatic methods and report a fundamental boost in performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, we have seen significant steps taken in the development of self-driving cars. Multiple companies are starting to roll out impressive systems that work in a variety of settings. These systems can sometimes give the impression that full self-driving is just around the corner and that we would soon build cars without even a steering wheel. The increase in the level of autonomy and control given to an AI provides an opportunity for new modes of human-vehicle interaction. However, surveys have shown that giving more control to an AI in self-driving cars is accompanied by a degree of uneasiness by passengers. In an attempt to alleviate this issue, recent works have taken a natural language-oriented approach by allowing the passenger to give commands that refer to specific objects in the visual scene. Nevertheless, this is only half the task as the car should also understand the physical destination of the command, which is what we focus on in this paper. We propose an extension in which we annotate the 3D destination that the car needs to reach after executing the given command and evaluate multiple different baselines on predicting this destination location. Additionally, we introduce a model that outperforms the prior works adapted for this particular setting",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Previous deep learning-based line segment detection (LSD) suffers from the immense model size and high computational cost for line prediction. This constrains them from real-time inference on computationally restricted environments. In this paper, we propose a real-time and light-weight line segment detector for resource-constrained environments named Mobile LSD (M-LSD). We design an extremely efficient LSD architecture by minimizing the backbone network and removing the typical multi-module process for line prediction found in previous methods. To maintain competitive performance with a light-weight network, we present novel training schemes: Segments of Line segment (SoL) augmentation, matching and geometric loss. SoL augmentation splits a line segment into multiple subparts, which are used to provide auxiliary line data during the training process. Moreover, the matching and geometric loss allow a model to capture additional geometric cues. Compared with TP-LSD-Lite, previously the best real-time LSD method, our model (M-LSD-tiny) achieves competitive performance with 2.5% of model size and an increase of 130.5% in inference speed on GPU. Furthermore, our model runs at 56.8 FPS and 48.6 FPS on the latest Android and iPhone mobile devices, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-time deep LSD available on mobile devices",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of facial forgery techniques, forgery detection has attracted more and more attention due to security concerns. Existing approaches attempt to use frequency information to mine subtle artifacts under high-quality forged faces. However, the exploitation of frequency information is coarse-grained, and more importantly, their vanilla learning process struggles to extract fine-grained forgery traces. To address this issue, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework to exploit both the RGB and fine-grained frequency clues. Specifically, we perform a fine-grained decomposition of RGB images to completely decouple the real and fake traces in the frequency space. Subsequently, we propose a progressive enhancement learning framework based on a two-branch network, combined with self-enhancement and mutual-enhancement modules. The self-enhancement module captures the traces in different input spaces based on spatial noise enhancement and channel attention. The Mutual-enhancement module concurrently enhances RGB and frequency features by communicating in the shared spatial dimension. The progressive enhancement process facilitates the learning of discriminative features with fine-grained face forgery clues. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art face forgery detection methods",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of facial manipulation techniques has aroused public concerns in recent years. Existing deepfake video detection approaches attempt to capture the discrim- inative features between real and fake faces based on tem- poral modelling. However, these works impose supervisions on sparsely sampled video frames but overlook the local mo- tions among adjacent frames, which instead encode rich in- consistency information that can serve as an efficient indica- tor for DeepFake video detection. To mitigate this issue, we delves into the local motion and propose a novel sampling unit named snippet which contains a few successive videos frames for local temporal inconsistency learning. Moreover, we elaborately design an Intra-Snippet Inconsistency Module (Intra-SIM) and an Inter-Snippet Interaction Module (Inter- SIM) to establish a dynamic inconsistency modelling frame- work. Specifically, the Intra-SIM applies bi-directional tem- poral difference operations and a learnable convolution ker- nel to mine the short-term motions within each snippet. The Inter-SIM is then devised to promote the cross-snippet infor- mation interaction to form global representations. The Intra- SIM and Inter-SIM work in an alternate manner and can be plugged into existing 2D CNNs. Our method outperforms the state of the art competitors on four popular benchmark dataset, i.e., FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFDC and Wild- Deepfake.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Assessing the performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has been an important topic due to its practical significance. Although several evaluation metrics have been proposed, they generally assess the quality of the whole generated image distribution. For Reference-guided Image Synthesis (RIS) tasks, i.e., rendering a source image in the style of another reference image, where assessing the quality of a single generated image is crucial, these metrics are not applicable. In this paper, we propose a general learning-based framework, Reference-guided Image Synthesis Assessment (RISA) to quantitatively evaluate the quality of a single generated image. Notably, the training of RISA does not require human annotations. In specific, the training data for RISA are acquired by the intermediate models from the training procedure in RIS, and weakly annotated by the number of models' iterations, based on the positive correlation between image quality and iterations. As this annotation is too coarse as a supervision signal, we introduce two techniques: 1) a pixel-wise interpolation scheme to refine the coarse labels, and 2) multiple binary classifiers to replace a naïve regressor. In addition, an unsupervised contrastive loss is introduced to effectively capture the style similarity between a generated image and its reference image. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate that RISA is highly consistent with human preference and transfers well across models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition has been developed with the advance of contrastive learning methods. The existing contrastive learning methods use normal augmentations to construct similar positive samples, which limits the ability to explore novel movement patterns. In this paper, to make better use of the movement patterns introduced by extreme augmentations, a Contrastive Learning framework utilizing Abundant Information Mining for self-supervised action Representation (AimCLR) is proposed. First, the extreme augmentations and the Energy-based Attention-guided Drop Module (EADM) are proposed to obtain diverse positive samples, which bring novel movement patterns to improve the universality of the learned representations. Second, since directly using extreme augmentations may not be able to boost the performance due to the drastic changes in original identity, the Dual Distributional Divergence Minimization Loss (D3M Loss) is proposed to minimize the distribution divergence in a more gentle way. Third, the Nearest Neighbors Mining (NNM) is proposed to further expand positive samples to make the abundant information mining process more reasonable. Exhaustive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, PKU-MMD, NTU RGB+D 120 datasets have verified that our AimCLR can significantly perform favorably against state-of-the-art methods under a variety of evaluation protocols with observed higher quality action representations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects using only a few examples. How to adapt state-of-the-art object detectors to the few-shot domain remains challenging. Object proposal is a key ingredient in modern object detectors. However, the quality of proposals generated for few-shot classes using existing methods is far worse than that of many-shot classes, e.g., missing boxes for few-shot classes due to misclassification or inaccurate spatial locations with respect to true objects. To address the noisy proposal problem, we propose a novel meta-learning based FSOD model by jointly optimizing the few-shot proposal generation and fine-grained few-shot proposal classification. To improve proposal generation for few-shot classes, we propose to learn a lightweight metric-learning based prototype matching network, instead of the conventional simple linear object/nonobject classifier, e.g., used in RPN. Our non-linear classifier with the feature fusion network could improve the discriminative prototype matching and the proposal recall for few-shot classes. To improve the fine-grained few-shot proposal classification, we propose a novel attentive feature alignment method to address the spatial misalignment between the noisy proposals and few-shot classes, thus improving the performance of few-shot object detection. Meanwhile we learn a separate Faster R-CNN detection head for many-shot base classes and show strong performance of maintaining base-classes knowledge.

    "abstract": "Clustering-based unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) reduces exhaustive annotations. However, owing to unsatisfactory feature embedding and imperfect clustering, pseudo labels for target domain data inherently contain an unknown proportion of wrong ones, which would mislead feature learning. In this paper, we propose an approach named probabilistic uncertainty guided progressive label refinery (P2LR) for domain adaptive person re-identification. First, we propose to model the labeling uncertainty with the probabilistic distance along with ideal single-peak distributions. A quantitative criterion is established to measure the uncertainty of pseudo labels and facilitate the network training. Second, we explore a progressive strategy for refining pseudo labels. With the uncertainty-guided alternative optimization, we balance between the exploration of target domain data and the negative effects of noisy labeling. On top of a strong baseline, we obtain significant improvements and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on four UDA ReID benchmarks.

    "abstract": "We present Laneformer, a conceptually simple yet powerful transformer-based architecture tailored for lane detection that is a long-standing research topic for visual perception in autonomous driving. The dominant paradigms rely on purely CNN-based architectures which often fail in incorporating relations of long-range lane points and global contexts induced by surrounding objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Inspired by recent advances of the transformer encoder-decoder architecture in various vision tasks, we move forwards to design a new end-to-end Laneformer architecture that revolutionizes the conventional transformers into better capturing the shape and semantic characteristics of lanes, with minimal overhead in latency. First, coupling with deformable pixel-wise self-attention in the encoder, Laneformer presents two new row and column self-attention operations to efficiently mine point context along with the lane shapes. Second, motivated by the appearing objects would affect the decision of predicting lane segments, Laneformer further includes the detected object instances as extra inputs of multi-head attention blocks in the encoder and decoder to facilitate the lane point detection by sensing semantic contexts. Specifically, the bounding box locations of objects are added into Key module to provide interaction with each pixel and query while the ROI-aligned features are inserted into Value module. Extensive experiments demonstrate our Laneformer achieves state-of-the-art performances on CULane benchmark, in terms of 77.1% F1 score.

    "abstract": "Although considerable progress has been achieved regarding the transformers in recent years, the large number of parameters, quadratic computational complexity, and memory cost conditioned on long sequences make the transformers hard to train and implement, especially in edge computing configurations. In this case, a dizzying number of works have sought to make improvements around computational and memory efficiency upon the original transformer architecture. Nevertheless, many of them restrict the context in the attention to seek a trade-off between cost and performance with prior knowledge of orderly stored data. It is imperative to dig deep into an efficient feature extractor for point clouds due to their irregularity and a large number of points. In this paper, we propose a novel skeleton decomposition-based self-attention (SD-SA) which has no sequence length limit and exhibits favorable scalability in long-sequence models. Due to the numerical low-rank nature of self-attention, we approximate it by the skeleton decomposition method while maintaining its effectiveness. At this point, we have shown that the proposed method works for the proposed approach on point cloud classification, segmentation, and detection tasks on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, and KITTI datasets, respectively.

As an important tool of regularizing the distribution, batch normalization (BN) has been widely used in existing methods. However, they neglect that BN is severely biased to the training domain and inevitably suffers the performance drop if directly generalized without being updated. To tackle this issue, we propose Batch Norm Test-time Adaption (BNTA), a novel re-id framework that applies the self-supervised strategy to update BN parameters adaptively. Specifically, BNTA quickly explores the domain-aware information within unlabeled target data before inference, and accordingly modulates the feature distribution normalized by BN to adapt to the target domain. This is accomplished by two designed self-supervised auxiliary tasks, namely part positioning and part nearest neighbor matching, which help the model mine the domain-aware information with respect to the structure and identity of body parts, respectively. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on three re-id datasets and confirm the superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods",

For this purpose, this paper studies object-level feature propagation, and proposes an object query propagation (QueryProp) framework for high-performance video object detection. The proposed QueryProp contains two propagation strategies: 1) query propagation is performed from sparse key frames to dense non-key frames to reduce the redundant computation on non-key frames; 2) query propagation is performed from previous key frames to the current key frame to improve feature representation by temporal context modeling. To further facilitate query propagation, an adaptive propagation gate is designed to achieve flexible key frame selection. We conduct extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset.

It is desirable to generate intelligible and natural speech with a fast speed in unconstrained settings.

Although these methods have achieved promising performance, they are prone to bring issues including high inference latency and mel-spectrogram over-smoothness. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel flow-based non-autoregressive lip-to-speech model (GlowLTS) to break autoregressive constraints and achieve faster inference. Concretely, we adopt a flow-based decoder which is optimized by maximizing the likelihood of the training data and is capable of more natural and fast speech generation. Moreover, we devise a condition module to improve the intelligibility of generated speech.

Most existing works mainly tackle this problem by reusing the backbone network to extract features of detected discriminative regions. However, this strategy inevitably complicates the pipeline and pushes the proposed regions to contain most parts of the objects thus fails to locate the really important parts. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) shows its strong performance in the traditional classification task. The self-attention mechanism of the transformer links every patch token to the classification token. In this work, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the ViT framework in the fine-grained recognition setting. Then motivated by the strength of the attention link can be intuitively considered as an indicator of the importance of tokens, we further propose a novel Part Selection Module that can be applied to most of the transformer architectures where we integrate all raw attention weights of the transformer into an attention map for guiding the network to effectively and accurately select discriminative image patches and compute their relations. A contrastive loss is applied to enlarge the distance between feature representations of confusing classes.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new self-supervised scene flow estimation approach for a pair of consecutive point clouds. The key idea of our approach is to represent discrete point clouds as continuous probability density functions using Gaussian mixture models. Scene flow estimation is therefore converted into the problem of recovering motion from the alignment of probability density functions, which we achieve using a closed-form expression of the classic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence. Unlike existing nearest-neighbor-based approaches that use hard pairwise correspondences, our proposed approach establishes soft and implicit point correspondences between point clouds and generates more robust and accurate scene flow in the presence of missing correspondences and outliers. Comprehensive experiments show that our method makes noticeable gains over the Chamfer Distance and the Earth Mover's Distance in real-world environments and achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised learning methods on FlyingThings3D and KITTI, even outperforming some supervised methods with ground truth annotations",

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D object detection from point clouds has become a crucial component in autonomous driving. However, the volumetric representations and the projection methods in previous works fail to establish the relationships between the local point sets. In this paper, we propose Sparse Voxel-Graph Attention Network (SVGA-Net), a novel end-to-end trainable network which mainly contains voxel-graph module and sparse-to-dense regression module to achieve comparable 3D detection tasks from raw LIDAR data. Specifically, SVGA-Net constructs the local complete graph within each divided 3D spherical voxel and global KNN graph through all voxels. The local and global graphs serve as the attention mechanism to enhance the extracted features. In addition, the novel sparse-to-dense regression module enhances the 3D box estimation accuracy through feature maps aggregation at different levels. Experiments on KITTI detection benchmark and Waymo Open dataset demonstrate the efficiency of extending the graph representation to 3D object detection and the proposed SVGA-Net can achieve decent detection accuracy",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification aims at learning on an unlabeled target domain with only labeled data in source domain. Currently, the state-of-the-arts usually solve this problem by pseudo-label-based clustering and fine-tuning in target domain. However, the reason behind the noises of pseudo labels is not sufficiently explored, especially for the popular multi-branch models. We argue that the consistency between different feature spaces is the key to the pseudo labels' quality. Then a SElf-Consistent pseudo label RefinEmenT method, termed as SECRET, is proposed to improve consistency by mutually refining the pseudo labels generated from different feature spaces. The proposed SECRET gradually encourages the improvement of pseudo labels' quality during training process, which further leads to better cross-domain Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method. Specifically, our method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by 6.3% in terms of mAP on the challenging dataset MSMT17. In the purely unsupervised setting, our method also surpasses existing works by a large margin. Code is available at https://github.com/LunarShen/SECRET",

    "title": "Visual Semantics Allow for Textual Reasoning Better in Scene Text Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing Scene Text Recognition (STR) methods typically use a language model to optimize the joint probability of the 1D character sequence predicted by a visual recognition (VR) model, which ignore the 2D spatial context of visual semantics within and between character instances, making them not generalize well to arbitrary shape scene text. To address this issue, we make the first attempt to perform textual reasoning based on visual semantics in this paper. Technically, given the character segmentation maps predicted by a VR model, we construct a subgraph for each instance, where nodes represent the pixels in it and edges are added between nodes based on their spatial similarity. Then, these subgraphs are sequentially connected by their root nodes and merged into a complete graph. Based on this graph, we devise a graph convolutional network for textual reasoning (GTR) by supervising it with a cross-entropy loss. GTR can be easily plugged in representative STR models to improve their performance owing to better textual reasoning. Specifically, we construct our model, namely S-GTR, by paralleling GTR to the language model in a segmentation-based STR baseline, which can effectively exploit the visual-linguistic complementarity via mutual learning. S-GTR sets new state-of-the-art on six challenging STR benchmarks and generalizes well to multi-linguistic datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/adeline-cs/GTR",

We show that the proposed loss function learns favorable embeddings compared to the standard InfoNCE whenever at least noisy ranking information can be obtained or when the definition of positives and negatives is blurry. We demonstrate this for a supervised classification task with additional superclass labels and noisy similarity scores. Furthermore, we show that RINCE can also be applied to unsupervised training with experiments on unsupervised representation learning from videos. In particular, the embedding yields higher classification accuracy, retrieval rates and performs better on out-of-distribution detection than the standard InfoNCE loss",

However, existing deep dehazing models only give deterministic results without discussing the uncertainty of them.

In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-driven dehazing network (UDN) that improves the dehazing results by exploiting the relationship between the uncertain and confident representations. We first introduce an Uncertainty Estimation Block (UEB) to predict the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty together. Then, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Feature Modulation (UFM) block to adaptively enhance the learned features. UFM predicts a convolution kernel and channel-wise modulation cofficients conitioned on the uncertainty weighted representation. Moreover, we develop an uncertainty-driven self-distillation loss to improve the uncertain representation by transferring the knowledge from the confident one.

    "abstract": "The development of detection methods for oriented object detection remains a challenging task. A considerable obstacle is the wide variation in the shape (e.g., aspect ratio) of objects. Sample selection in general object detection has been widely studied as it plays a crucial role in the performance of the detection method and has achieved great progress. However, existing sample selection strategies still overlook some issues: (1) most of them ignore the object shape information; (2) they do not make a potential distinction between selected positive samples; and (3) some of them can only be applied to either anchor-free or anchor-based methods and cannot be used for both of them simultaneously. In this paper, we propose novel flexible shape-adaptive selection (SA-S) and shape-adaptive measurement (SA-M) strategies for oriented object detection, which comprise an SA-S strategy for sample selection and SA-M strategy for the quality estimation of positive samples. Specifically, the SA-S strategy dynamically selects samples according to the shape information and characteristics distribution of objects. The SA-M strategy measures the localization potential and adds quality information on the selected positive samples. The experimental results on both anchor-free and anchor-based baselines and four publicly available oriented datasets (DOTA, HRSC2016, UCAS-AOD, and ICDAR2015) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

A heterogeneous graph with the \"resolution\" attribute is constructed to explicitly model the feature and spatial-scaling relationship of multi-resolution patches. We then design a novel resolution-aware attention convolution (RAConv) block to learn compact yet discriminative representation from the graph, which tackles the heterogeneity of node neighbors with different resolutions and yields more reliable message passing. More importantly, to explore the task-related structured information of WSI pyramid, we elaborately design a novel iterative hierarchical pooling (IHPool) module to progressively aggregate the heterogeneous graph based on scaling relationships of different nodes. We evaluated our method on two public WSI datasets from the TCGA project, i.e., esophageal cancer and kidney cancer.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) are able to greatly reduce computational costs and memory footprints, facilitating model deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, in comparison to their full-precision counterparts, BNNs suffer from severe accuracy degradation. Research aiming to reduce this accuracy gap has thus far largely focused on specific network architectures with few or no 1 × 1 convolutional layers, for which standard binarization methods do not work well. Because 1 × 1 convolutions are common in the design of modern architectures (e.g. GoogleNet, ResNet, DenseNet), it is crucial to develop a method to binarize them effectively for BNNs to be more widely adopted. In this work, we propose an \"Elastic-Link\" (EL) module to enrich information flow within a BNN by adaptively adding real-valued input features to the subsequent convolutional output features. The proposed EL module is easily implemented and can be used in conjunction with other methods for BNNs. We demonstrate that adding EL to BNNs produces a significant improvement on the challenging large-scale ImageNet dataset. For example, we raise the top-1 accuracy of binarized ResNet26 from 57.9% to 64.0%. EL also aids con-vergence in the training of binarized MobileNet, for which a top-1 accuracy of 56.4% is achieved. Finally, with the integration of ReActNet, it yields a new state-of-the-art result of 71.9% top-1 accuracy",

Current Deepfake detection methods achieve superior performances in dealing with low-visual-quality Deepfake media which can be distinguished by the obvious visual artifacts. However, with the development of deep generative models, the realism of Deepfake media has been significantly improved and becomes tough challenging to current detection models. In this paper, we propose a frame inference-based detection framework (FInfer) to solve the problem of high-visual-quality Deepfake detection. Specifically, we first learn the referenced representations of the current and future frames' faces. Then, the current frames' facial representations are utilized to predict the future frames' facial representations by using an autoregressive model. Finally, a representation-prediction loss is devised to maximize the discriminability of real videos and fake videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our FInfer framework through information theory analyses. The entropy and mutual information analyses indicate the correlation between the predicted representations and referenced representations in real videos is higher than that of high-visual-quality Deepfake videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the performance of our method is promising in terms of in-dataset detection performance, detection efficiency, and cross-dataset detection performance in high-visual-quality Deepfake videos",

However, SOTA dynamic convolution operators are sensitive to input noises (e.g., Gaussian noise, shot noise, e.t.c.) and lack sufficient spatial contextual information in filter generation. To alleviate this inherent weakness, we propose a lightweight and heterogeneous-structure (i.e., static and dynamic) operator, named Bi-volution. On the one hand, Bi-volution is designed as a dual-branch structure to fully leverage complementary properties of static/dynamic convolution, which endows Bi-volution more robust properties and higher performance. On the other hand, the Spatial Augmented Kernel Generation module is proposed to improve the dynamic convolution, realizing the learning of spatial context information with negligible additional computational complexity. Extensive experiments illustrate that the ResNet-50 equipped with Bi-volution achieves a highly competitive boost in performance (+2.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, +2.4% box AP and +2.2% mask AP on COCO detection and instance segmentation) while maintaining extremely low FLOPs (i.e., ResNet50@2.7 GFLOPs).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "There have been two streams in the 3D detection from point clouds: single-stage methods and two-stage methods. While the former is more computationally efficient, the latter usually provides better detection accuracy. By carefully examining the two-stage approaches, we have found that if appropriately designed, the first stage can produce accurate box regression. In this scenario, the second stage mainly rescores the boxes such that the boxes with better localization get selected. From this observation, we have devised a single-stage anchor-free network that can fulfill these requirements. This network, named AFDetV2, extends the previous work by incorporating a self-calibrated convolution block in the backbone, a keypoint auxiliary supervision, and an IoU prediction branch in the multi-task head. We take a simple product of the predicted IoU score with the classification heatmap to form the final classification confidence. The enhanced backbone strengthens the box localization capability, and the rescoring approach effectively joins the object presence confidence and the box regression accuracy. As a result, the detection accuracy is drastically boosted in the single-stage. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset. We have observed that our AFDetV2 achieves the state-of-the-art results on these two datasets, superior to all the prior arts, including both the single-stage and the two-stage 3D detectors. AFDetV2 won the 1st place in the Real-Time 3D Detection of the Waymo Open Dataset Challenge 2021. In addition, a variant of our model AFDetV2-Base was entitled the \"Most Efficient Model\" by the Challenge Sponsor, showing a superior computational efficiency. To demonstrate the generality of this single-stage method, we have also applied it to the first stage of the two-stage networks. Without exception, the results show that with the strengthened backbone and the rescoring approach, the second stage refinement is no longer needed",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Clustering is important for domain adaptive person re-identification(re-ID). A majority of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods conduct clustering on the target domain and then use the generated pseudo labels for adaptive training. Albeit important, the clustering pipeline adopted by current literature is quite standard and lacks consideration for two characteristics of re-ID, i.e., 1) a single person has various feature distribution in multiple cameras. 2) a person's occurrence in the same camera are usually temporally continuous. We argue that the multi-camera distribution hinders clustering because it enlarges the intra-class distances. In contrast, the temporal continuity prior is beneficial, because it offers clue for distinguishing some look-alike person (who are temporally far away from each other). These two insight motivate us to propose a novel Divide-And-Regroup Clustering (DARC) pipeline for re-ID UDA. Specifically, DARC divides the unlabeled data into multiple camera-specific groups and conducts local clustering within each camera. Afterwards, it regroups those local clusters potentially belonging to the same person into a unity. Through this divide-and-regroup pipeline, DARC avoids directly clustering across multiple cameras and focuses on the feature distribution within each individual camera. Moreover, during the local clustering, DARC uses the temporal continuity prior to distinguish some look-alike person and thus reduces false positive pseudo labels. Consequentially, DARC effectively reduces clustering errors and improves UDA. Importantly, we show that DARC is compatible to many pseudo label-based UDA methods and brings general improvement. Based on a recent UDA method, DARC advances the state of the art (e.g, 85.1% mAP on MSMT-to-Market and 83.1% mAP on PersonX-to-Market)",

    "abstract": "Malicious applications of deepfakes (i.e., technologies generating target facial attributes or entire faces from facial images) have posed a huge threat to individuals' reputation and security. To mitigate these threats, recent studies have proposed adversarial watermarks to combat deepfake models, leading them to generate distorted outputs. Despite achieving impressive results, these adversarial watermarks have low image-level and model-level transferability, meaning that they can protect only one facial image from one specific deepfake model. To address these issues, we propose a novel solution that can generate a Cross-Model Universal Adversarial Watermark (CMUA-Watermark), protecting a large number of facial images from multiple deepfake models. Specifically, we begin by proposing a cross-model universal attack pipeline that attacks multiple deepfake models iteratively. Then, we design a two-level perturbation fusion strategy to alleviate the conflict between the adversarial watermarks generated by different facial images and models. Moreover, we address the key problem in cross-model optimization with a heuristic approach to automatically find the suitable attack step sizes for different models, further weakening the model-level conflict. Finally, we introduce a more reasonable and comprehensive evaluation method to fully test the proposed method and compare it with existing ones. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CMUA-Watermark can effectively distort the fake facial images generated by multiple deepfake models while achieving a better performance than existing methods.

    "title": "Deconfounded Visual Grounding",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We focus on the confounding bias between language and location in the visual grounding pipeline, where we find that the bias is the major visual reasoning bottleneck. For example, the grounding process is usually a trivial languagelocation association without visual reasoning, e.g., grounding any language query containing sheep to the nearly central regions, due to that most queries about sheep have ground-truth locations at the image center. First, we frame the visual grounding pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the causalities among image, query, target location and underlying confounder. Through the causal graph, we know how to break the grounding bottleneck: deconfounded visual grounding. Second, to tackle the challenge that the confounder is unobserved in general, we propose a confounder-agnostic approach called: Referring Expression Deconfounder (RED), to remove the confounding bias. Third, we implement RED as a simple language attention, which can be applied in any grounding method. On popular benchmarks, RED improves various state-of-the-art grounding methods by a significant margin. Code is available at: https://github.com/JianqiangH/Deconfounded_VG",

    "title": "Learning to Model Pixel-Embedded Affinity for Homogeneous Instance Segmentation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Homogeneous instance segmentation aims to identify each instance in an image where all interested instances belong to the same category, such as plant leaves and microscopic cells. Recently, proposal-free methods, which straightforwardly generate instance-aware information to group pixels into different instances, have received increasing attention due to their efficient pipeline. However, they often fail to distinguish adjacent instances due to similar appearances, dense distribution and ambiguous boundaries of instances in homogeneous images. In this paper, we propose a pixel-embedded affinity modeling method for homogeneous instance segmentation, which is able to preserve the semantic information of instances and improve the distinguishability of adjacent instances. Instead of predicting affinity directly, we propose a self-correlation module to explicitly model the pairwise relationships between pixels, by estimating the similarity between embeddings generated from the input image through CNNs. Based on the self-correlation module, we further design a cross-correlation module to maintain the semantic consistency between instances. Specifically, we map the transformed input images with different views and appearances into the same embedding space, and then mutually estimate the pairwise relationships of embeddings generated from the original input and its transformed variants. In addition, to integrate the global instance information, we introduce an embedding pyramid module to model affinity on different scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatile and superior performance of our method on three representative datasets.

    "abstract": "Spatial and channel attentions, modelling the semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively, have recently been widely used for semantic segmentation. However, computing spatial and channel attentions separately sometimes causes errors, especially for those difficult cases. In this paper, we propose Channelized Axial Attention (CAA) to seamlessly integrate channel attention and spatial attention into a single operation with negligible computation overhead. Specifically, we break down the dot-product operation of the spatial attention into two parts and insert channel relation in between, allowing for independently optimized channel attention on each spatial location. We further develop grouped vectorization, which allows our model to run with very little memory consumption without slowing down the running speed. Comparative experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, PASCAL Context, and COCO-Stuff, demonstrate that our CAA outperforms many state-of-the-art segmentation models (including dual attention) on all tested datasets",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to object detection on drone imagery, namely Multi-Proxy Detection Network with Unified Foreground Packing (UFPMP-Det). To deal with the numerous instances of very small scales, different from the common solution that divides the high-resolution input image into quite a number of chips with low foreground ratios to perform detection on them each, the Unified Foreground Packing (UFP) module is designed, where the sub-regions given by a coarse detector are initially merged through clustering to suppress background and the resulting ones are subsequently packed into a mosaic for a single inference, thus significantly reducing overall time cost. Furthermore, to address the more serious confusion between inter-class similarities and intra-class variations of instances, which deteriorates detection performance but is rarely discussed, the Multi-Proxy Detection Network (MP-Det) is presented to model object distributions in a fine-grained manner by employing multiple proxy learning, and the proxies are enforced to be diverse by minimizing a Bag-of-Instance-Words (BoIW) guided optimal transport loss. By such means, UFPMP-Det largely promotes both the detection accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments are carried out on the widely used VisDrone and UAVDT datasets, and UFPMP-Det reports new state-of-the-art scores at a much higher speed, highlighting its advantages.

In this work, we propose a novel modality-adaptive mixup and invariant decomposition (MID) approach for RGB-infrared person re-identification towards learning modality-invariant and discriminative representations. MID designs a modality-adaptive mixup scheme to generate suitable mixed modality images between RGB and infrared images for mitigating the inherent modality discrepancy at the pixel-level. It formulates modality mixup procedure as Markov decision process, where an actor-critic agent learns dynamical and local linear interpolation policy between different regions of cross-modality images under a deep reinforcement learning framework. Such policy guarantees modality-invariance in a more continuous latent space and avoids manifold intrusion by the corrupted mixed modality samples. Moreover, to further counter modality discrepancy and enforce invariant visual semantics at the feature-level, MID employs modality-adaptive convolution decomposition to disassemble a regular convolution layer into modality-specific basis layers and a modality-shared coefficient layer. Extensive experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate superior performance of MID over state-of-the-art methods",

However, it is challenging to extract robust multimodal representations due to the heterogeneous characteristics of data from multimodal sensors and disparate human activities, especially in the presence of noisy and misaligned sensor data. In this work, we propose a cooperative multitask learning-based guided multimodal fusion approach, MuMu, to extract robust multimodal representations for human activity recognition (HAR). MuMu employs an auxiliary task learning approach to extract features specific to each set of activities with shared characteristics (activity-group). MuMu then utilizes activity-group-specific features to direct our proposed Guided Multimodal Fusion Approach (GM-Fusion) for extracting complementary multimodal representations, designed as the target task. We evaluated MuMu by comparing its performance to state-of-the-art multimodal HAR approaches on three activity datasets. Our extensive experimental results suggest that MuMu outperforms all the evaluated approaches across all three datasets. Additionally, the ablation study suggests that MuMu significantly outperforms the baseline models (p<0.05), which do not use our guided multimodal fusion. Finally, the robust performance of MuMu on noisy and misaligned sensor data posits that our approach is suitable for HAR in real-world settings",

As widely used metrics for GANs focus more on the overall performance of the model, evaluation on the quality of individual generations or detection of defective generations is challenging. While recent studies try to detect featuremap units that cause artifacts and evaluate individual samples, these approaches require additional resources such as external networks or a number of training data to approximate the real data manifold. In this work, we propose the concept of local activation, and devise a metric on the local activation to detect artifact generations without additional supervision. We empirically verify that our approach can detect and correct artifact generations from GANs with various datasets.

    "abstract": "Various deepfake detectors have been proposed, but challenges still exist to detect images of unknown categories or GAN models outside of the training settings. Such issues arise from the overfitting issue, which we discover from our own analysis and the previous studies to originate from the frequency-level artifacts in generated images. We find that ignoring the frequency-level artifacts can improve the detector's generalization across various GAN models, but it can reduce the model's performance for the trained GAN models. Thus, we design a framework to generalize the deepfake detector for both the known and unseen GAN models. Our framework generates the frequency-level perturbation maps to make the generated images indistinguishable from the real images. By updating the deepfake detector along with the training of the perturbation generator, our model is trained to detect the frequency-level artifacts at the initial iterations and consider the image-level irregularities at the last iterations. For experiments, we design new test scenarios varying from the training settings in GAN models, color manipulations, and object categories.

    "title": "Learning Disentangled Attribute Representations for Robust Pedestrian Attribute Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Although various methods have been proposed for pedestrian attribute recognition, most studies follow the same feature learning mechanism, \\ie, learning a shared pedestrian image feature to classify multiple attributes. However, this mechanism leads to low-confidence predictions and non-robustness of the model in the inference stage. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We mathematically discover that the central cause is that the optimal shared feature cannot maintain high similarities with multiple classifiers simultaneously in the context of minimizing classification loss. In addition, this feature learning mechanism ignores the spatial and semantic distinctions between different attributes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel disentangled attribute feature learning (DAFL) framework to learn a disentangled feature for each attribute, which exploits the semantic and spatial characteristics of attributes. The framework mainly consists of learnable semantic queries, a cascaded semantic-spatial cross-attention (SSCA) module, and a group attention merging (GAM) module. Specifically, based on learnable semantic queries, the cascaded SSCA module iteratively enhances the spatial localization of attribute-related regions and aggregates region features into multiple disentangled attribute features, used for classification and updating learnable semantic queries. The GAM module splits attributes into groups based on spatial distribution and utilizes reliable group attention to supervise query attention maps. Experiments on PETA, RAPv1, PA100k, and RAPv2 show that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods",

Different from existing methods, which tend to accomplish the relighting task directly, we investigate the intrinsic degradation and relight the low-light image while refining the details and color in two steps. Inspired by the color image formulation (diffuse illumination color plus environment illumination color), we first estimate the degradation from low-light inputs to simulate the distortion of environment illumination color, and then refine the content to recover the loss of diffuse illumination color. To this end, we propose a novel Degradation-to-Refinement Generation Network (DRGN). Its distinctive features can be summarized as 1) A novel two-step generation network for degradation learning and content refinement. It is not only superior to one-step methods, but also capable of synthesizing sufficient paired samples to benefit the model training; 2) A multi-resolution fusion network to represent the target information (degradation or contents) in a multi-scale cooperative manner, which is more effective to address the complex unmixing problems. Extensive experiments on both the enhancement task and the joint detection task have verified the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, surpassing the SOTA by 1.59dB on average and 3.18\\% in mAP on the ExDark dataset.

    "abstract": "Multiple medical institutions collaboratively training a model using federated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the potential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge in real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client) and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss. Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior.

In this work, we seek to improve the performance of layout generation by incorporating the concept of regions, which consist of a smaller number of elements and appears like a simple layout, into the generation process. Specifically, we leverage Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as the overall architecture and decompose the decoding process into two stages. The first stage predicts representations for regions, and the second stage fills in the detailed position for each element within the region based on the predicted region representation. Compared to prior studies that merely abstract the layout into a list of elements and generate all the element positions in one go, our approach has at least two advantages. First, by the two-stage decoding, our approach decouples the complex layout generation task into several simple layout generation tasks, which reduces the problem difficulty. Second, the predicted regions can help the model roughly know what the graphic layout looks like and serve as global context to improve the generation of detailed element positions. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the existing methods, especially on the complex graphic layouts",

While most pansharpening methods are based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures with standard convolution operations, few attempts have been made with context-adaptive/dynamic convolution, which delivers impressive results on high-level vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to generate local-context adaptive (LCA) convolution kernels and introduce a new global harmonic (GH) bias mechanism, exploiting image local specificity as well as integrating global information, dubbed LAGConv. The proposed LAGConv can replace the standard convolution that is context-agnostic to fully perceive the particularity of each pixel for the task of remote sensing pansharpening. Furthermore, by applying the LAGConv, we provide an image fusion network architecture, which is more effective than conventional CNN-based pansharpening approaches. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated by extensive experiments implemented on a wide range of datasets compared with state-of-the-art pansharpening methods.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing portrait matting methods either require auxiliary inputs that are costly to obtain or involve multiple stages that are computationally expensive, making them less suitable for real-time applications. In this work, we present a light-weight matting objective decomposition network (MODNet) for portrait matting in real-time with a single input image. The key idea behind our efficient design is by optimizing a series of sub-objectives simultaneously via explicit constraints. In addition, MODNet includes two novel techniques for improving model efficiency and robustness. First, an Efficient Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (e-ASPP) module is introduced to fuse multi-scale features for semantic estimation. Second, a self-supervised sub-objectives consistency (SOC) strategy is proposed to adapt MODNet to real-world data to address the domain shift problem common to trimap-free methods. MODNet is easy to be trained in an end-to-end manner. It is much faster than contemporaneous methods and runs at 67 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU. Experiments show that MODNet outperforms prior trimap-free methods by a large margin on both Adobe Matting Dataset and a carefully designed photographic portrait matting (PPM-100) benchmark proposed by us. Further, MODNet achieves remarkable results on daily photos and videos",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Since human drivers only consider the driving-related factors that affect vehicle control depending on the situation, they can drive safely even in diverse driving environments. To mimic this behavior, we propose an autonomous driving framework based on the two-stage representation learning that initially splits the latent features as domain-specific features and domain-general features. Subsequently, the dynamic-object features, which contain information of dynamic objects, are disentangled from latent features using mutual information estimator. In this study, the problem in behavior cloning is divided into several domain-specific subspaces, with experts becoming specialized on each domain-specific policy. The proposed mixture of domain-specific experts (MoDE) model predicts the final control values through the cooperation of experts using a gating function. The domain-specific features are used to calculate the importance weight of the domain-specific experts, and the disentangled domain-general and dynamic-object features are applied in estimating the control values. To validate the proposed MoDE model, we conducted several experiments and achieved a higher success rate on the CARLA benchmarks under several conditions and tasks than state-of-the-art approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, automated surveillance cameras can change a visible sensor and a thermal sensor for all-day operation. However, existing single-modal pedestrian detectors mainly focus on detecting pedestrians in only one specific modality (i.e., visible or thermal), so they cannot cope with other modal inputs. In addition, recent multispectral pedestrian detectors have shown remarkable performance by adopting multispectral modalities, but they also have limitations in practical applications (e.g., different Field-of-View (FoV) and frame rate). In this paper, we introduce a versatile pedestrian detector that shows robust detection performance in any single modality. We propose a multisensory-matching contrastive loss to reduce the difference between the visual representation of pedestrians in the visible and thermal modalities. Moreover, for the robust detection on a single modality, we design a Multispectral Recalling (MSR) Memory. The MSR Memory enhances the visual representation of the single modal features by recalling that of the multispectral modalities. To guide the MSR Memory to store the multispectral modal contexts, we introduce a multispectral recalling loss. It enables the pedestrian detector to encode more discriminative features with a single input modality. We believe our method is a step forward detector that can be applied to a variety of real-world applications. The comprehensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method",

In this paper, we put forth a new GZSL technique that improves the GZSL classification performance greatly.

In doing so, we can remove the interference, if any, caused by the attribute-irrelevant information contained in the image feature. To train a network extracting the semantic feature, we present two novel loss functions, 1) mutual information-based loss to capture all the attribute-related information in the image feature and 2) similarity-based loss to remove unwanted attribute-irrelevant information.

    "title": "Distinguishing Homophenes Using Multi-Head Visual-Audio Memory for Lip Reading",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recognizing speech from silent lip movement, which is called lip reading, is a challenging task due to 1) the inherent information insufficiency of lip movement to fully represent the speech, and 2) the existence of homophenes that have similar lip movement with different pronunciations. In this paper, we try to alleviate the aforementioned two challenges in lip reading by proposing a Multi-head Visual-audio Memory (MVM). Firstly, MVM is trained with audio-visual datasets and remembers audio representations by modelling the inter-relationships of paired audio-visual representations. At the inference stage, visual input alone can extract the saved audio representation from the memory by examining the learned inter-relationships. Therefore, the lip reading model can complement the insufficient visual information with the extracted audio representations. Secondly, MVM is composed of multi-head key memories for saving visual features and one value memory for saving audio knowledge, which is designed to distinguish the homophenes. With the multi-head key memories, MVM extracts possible candidate audio features from the memory, which allows the lip reading model to consider the possibility of which pronunciations can be represented from the input lip movement. This also can be viewed as an explicit implementation of the one-to-many mapping of viseme-to-phoneme. Moreover, MVM is employed in multi-temporal levels to consider the context when retrieving the memory and distinguish the homophenes. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in lip reading and in distinguishing the homophenes",

Tailored for such test-time training for style transfer, we present novel network architectures, with two sub-modules of correspondence and generation modules, and loss functions consisting of contrastive content, style, and cycle consistency losses. Our framework does not require offline training phase for style transfer, which has been one of the main challenges in existing methods, but the networks are to be solely learned during test time.

In this paper, we propose PrivateSNN, which aims to build low-power Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) from a pre-trained ANN model without leaking sensitive information contained in a dataset. Here, we tackle two types of leakage problems: 1) Data leakage is caused when the networks access real training data during an ANN-SNN conversion process. 2) Class leakage is caused when class-related features can be reconstructed from network parameters. In order to address the data leakage issue, we generate synthetic images from the pre-trained ANNs and convert ANNs to SNNs using the generated images. However, converted SNNs remain vulnerable to class leakage since the weight parameters have the same (or scaled) value with respect to ANN parameters. Therefore, we encrypt SNN weights by training SNNs with a temporal spike-based learning rule. Updating weight parameters with temporal data makes SNNs difficult to be interpreted in the spatial domain. We observe that the encrypted PrivateSNN eliminates data and class leakage issues with a slight performance drop (less than ~2%) and significant energy-efficiency gain (about 55x) compared to the standard ANN. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, highlighting the importance of privacy-preserving SNN training",

The proposed method, referred to as 3D DetecTrack, enables the detector and tracker to cooperate to generate a spatio-temporal representation of the camera and LiDAR data, with which 3D object detection and tracking are then performed. The detector constructs the spatio-temporal features via the weighted temporal aggregation of the spatial features obtained by the camera and LiDAR fusion. Then, the detector reconfigures the initial detection results using information from the tracklets maintained up to the previous time step. Based on the spatio-temporal features generated by the detector, the tracker associates the detected objects with previously tracked objects using a graph neural network (GNN). We devise a fully-connected GNN facilitated by a combination of rule-based edge pruning and attention-based edge gating, which exploits both spatial and temporal object contexts to improve tracking performance. The experiments conducted on both KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed 3D DetecTrack achieves significant improvements in both detection and tracking performances over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing methods through collaboration between the detector and tracker",

We hypothesize that an improved disentanglement of domain-related and task-related factors of dense intermediate layer features can greatly aid OCDA. Prior-arts attempt this indirectly by employing adversarial domain discriminators on the spatial CNN output. However, we find that latent features derived from the Fourier-based amplitude spectrum of deep CNN features hold a more tractable mapping with domain discrimination. Motivated by this, we propose a novel feature space Amplitude Spectrum Transformation (AST). During adaptation, we employ the AST auto-encoder for two purposes. First, carefully mined source-target instance pairs undergo a simulation of cross-domain feature stylization (AST-Sim) at a particular layer by altering the AST-latent. Second, AST operating at a later layer is tasked to normalize (AST-Norm) the domain content by fixing its latent to a mean prototype. Our simplified adaptation technique is not only clustering-free but also free from complex adversarial alignment. We achieve leading performance against the prior arts on the OCDA scene segmentation benchmarks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) refers to segmenting the target object in remaining frames given its annotation in the first frame, which has been actively studied in recent years. The key challenge lies in finding effective ways to exploit the spatio-temporal context of past frames to help learn discriminative target representation of current frame. In this paper, we propose a novel Siamese network with a specifically designed interactive transformer, called SITVOS, to enable effective context propagation from historical to current frames. Technically, we use the transformer encoder and decoder to handle the past frames and current frame separately, i.e., the encoder encodes robust spatio-temporal context of target object from the past frames, while the decoder takes the feature embedding of current frame as the query to retrieve the target from the encoder output. To further enhance the target representation, a feature interaction module (FIM) is devised to promote the information flow between the encoder and decoder. Moreover, we employ the Siamese architecture to extract backbone features of both past and current frames, which enables feature reuse and is more efficient than existing methods. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks validate the superiority of SITVOS over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/LANMNG/SITVOS",

In this work, we generate adversarial examples and then train the robust models for event-based data, for the first time.

First, null events are added to the event-based data to generate additional adversarial events. The perturbation size can be controlled with the number of null events. Second, the location and time of additional adversarial events are set to mislead DNNs in a gradient-based attack. Our algorithm achieves an attack success rate of 97.95% on the N-Caltech101 dataset.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised video object segmentation (UVOS) is a per-pixel binary labeling problem which aims at separating the foreground object from the background in the video without using the ground truth (GT) mask of the foreground object. Most of the previous UVOS models use the first frame or the entire video as a reference frame to specify the mask of the foreground object. Our question is why the first frame should be selected as a reference frame or why the entire video should be used to specify the mask. We believe that we can select a better reference frame to achieve the better UVOS performance than using only the first frame or the entire video as a reference frame. In our paper, we propose Easy Frame Selector (EFS). The EFS enables us to select an \"easy\" reference frame that makes the subsequent VOS become easy, thereby improving the VOS performance. Furthermore, we propose a new framework named as Iterative Mask Prediction (IMP). In the framework, we repeat applying EFS to the given video and selecting an \"easier\" reference frame from the video than the previous iteration, increasing the VOS performance incrementally. The IMP consists of EFS, Bi-directional Mask Prediction (BMP), and Temporal Information Updating (TIU).

Specifically, by leveraging the sparse convolution, SCTN transfers irregular point cloud into locally consistent flow features for estimating spatially consistent motions within an object/local object part. We further propose to explicitly learn point relations using a point transformer module, different from exiting methods. We show that the learned relation-based contextual information is rich and helpful for matching corresponding points, benefiting scene flow estimation.

Previous works treat this task as sequence generation, however, it is challenging to render a music-aligned long-term sequence with high kinematic complexity and coherent movements. In this paper, we reformulate it by a two-stage process, i.e., a key pose generation and then an in-between parametric motion curve prediction, where the key poses are easier to be synchronized with the music beats and the parametric curves can be efficiently regressed to render fluent rhythm-aligned movements. We named the proposed method as DanceFormer, which includes two cascading kinematics-enhanced transformer-guided networks (called DanTrans) that tackle each stage, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale music conditioned 3D dance dataset, called PhantomDance, that is accurately labeled by experienced animators rather than reconstruction or motion capture. This dataset also encodes dances as key poses and parametric motion curves apart from pose sequences, thus benefiting the training of our DanceFormer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method, even trained by existing datasets, can generate fluent, performative, and music-matched 3D dances that surpass previous works quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, the proposed DanceFormer, together with the PhantomDance dataset, are seamlessly compatible with industrial animation software, thus facilitating the adaptation for various downstream applications",
