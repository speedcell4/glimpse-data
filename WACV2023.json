    "title": "3D Change Localization and Captioning From Dynamic Scans of Indoor Scenes",
    "abstract": "Daily indoor scenes often involve constant changes due to human activities. To recognize scene changes, existing change captioning methods focus on describing changes from two images of a scene. However, to accurately perceive and appropriately evaluate physical changes and then identify the geometry of changed objects, recognizing and localizing changes in 3D space is crucial. Therefore, we propose a task to explicitly localize changes in 3D bounding boxes from two point clouds and describe detailed scene changes, including change types, object attributes, and spatial locations. Moreover, we create a simulated dataset with various scenes, allowing generating data without labor costs. We further propose a framework that allows different 3D object detectors to be incorporated in the change detection process, after which captions are generated based on the correlations of different change regions. The proposed framework achieves promising results in both change detection and captioning. Furthermore, we also evaluated on data collected from real scenes. The experiments show that pretraining on the proposed dataset increases the change detection accuracy by +12.8% (mAP0.25) when applied to real-world data. We believe that our proposed dataset and discussion could provide both a new benchmark and insights for future studies in scene change understanding",

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable progress in image translation, the complex scene with multiple discrepant objects remains a challenging problem. The translated images have low fidelity and tiny objects in fewer details causing unsatisfactory performance in object recognition. Without thorough object perception (i.e., bounding boxes, categories, and masks) of images as prior knowledge, the style transformation of each object will be difficult to track in translation. We propose panoptic-aware generative adversarial networks (PanopticGAN) for image-to-image translation together with a compact panoptic segmentation dataset. The panoptic perception (i.e., foreground instances and background semantics of the image scene) is extracted to achieve alignment between object content codes of the input domain and panoptic-level style codes sampled from the target style space, then refined by a proposed feature masking module for sharping object boundaries. The image-level combination between content and sampled style codes is also merged for higher fidelity image generation. Our proposed method was systematically compared with different competing methods and obtained significant improvement in both image quality and object recognition performance",

    "abstract": "Humans learn continually throughout their lifespan by accumulating diverse knowledge and fine-tuning it for future tasks. When presented with a similar goal, neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting if data distributions across sequential tasks are not stationary over the course of learning. An effective approach to address such continual learning (CL) problems is to use hypernetworks which generate task dependent weights for a target network. However, the continual learning performance of existing hypernetwork based approaches are affected by the assumption of independence of the weights across the layers in order to maintain parameter efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that uses a dependency preserving hypernetwork to generate weights for the target network while also maintaining the parameter efficiency. We propose to use recurrent neural network (RNN) based hypernetwork that can generate layer weights efficiently while allowing for dependencies across them. In addition, we propose novel regularisation and network growth techniques for the RNN based hypernetwork to further improve the continual learning performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted experiments on several image classification continual learning tasks and settings. We found that the proposed methods based on the RNN hypernetworks outperformed the baselines in all these CL settings and tasks",

    "title": "Learning How to MIMIC: Using Model Explanations To Guide Deep Learning Training",
    "abstract": "Healthcare is seen as one of the most influential applications of Deep Learning (DL). Increasingly, DL models are applied in healthcare settings with seemingly high levels of performance on-par with medical experts. Yet, very few are deployed into real-life scenarios with variable success rate. One of the main reasons for this is the lack of trust in those models by medical professionals driven by the black-box nature of the deployed models. Numerous explainable techniques have been developed to alleviate this issue by providing a view on how the model reached a given decision. Recent studies have shown that those explanations can expose the models' reliance on areas of the feature space that has no justifiable medical interpretation, widening the gap with the medical experts. In this paper we evaluate the deviation of saliency maps produced by DL classification models from radiologist's eye-gaze while they study the MIMIC-CXR-EGD images, and we propose a novel model architecture that utilises model explanations during training only (i.e. not during inference) to improve the overall plausibility of the model explanations. We substantially improve the similarity between the model's explanations and radiologists' eye-gaze data, reducing Kullback-Leibler Divergence by 90% and increasing Normalised Scanpath Saliency by 216%. We argue that this significant improvement is an important step towards building more robust and interpretable DL solutions in healthcare",

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised vision-language (V-L) pre-training (W-VLP) aims at learning cross-modal alignment with little or no paired data, such as aligned images and captions. Recent W-VLP methods, which pair visual features with object tags, help achieve performances comparable with some VLP models trained with aligned pairs in various V-L downstream tasks. This, however, is not the case in cross- modal retrieval (XMR). We argue that the learning of such a W-VLP model is curbed and biased by the object tags of limited semantics. We address the lack of paired V-L data for model supervision with a novel Visual Vocabulary based Feature Hallucinator (WFH), which is trained via weak supervision as a W-VLP model, not requiring images paired with captions. WFH generates visual hallucinations from texts, which are then paired with the originally unpaired texts, allowing more diverse interactions across modalities. Empirically, WFH consistently boosts the prior W-VLP works, e.g. U-VisualBERT (U-VB), over a variety of V-L tasks, i.e. XMR, Visual Question Answering, etc. Notably, benchmarked with recall@ 1,5,10 , it consistently improves U-VB on image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval on two popular datasets Flickr30K and MSCOCO. Meanwhile, it gains by at least 14.5% in cross-dataset generalization tests on these XMR tasks. Moreover, in other V-L downstream tasks considered, our WFH models are on par with models trained with paired V-L data, revealing the utility of unpaired data. These results demonstrate greater generalization of the proposed W-VLP model with WFH",

PL approaches assign labels to unlabeled data before re-training the model with a combination of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. However, PL methods are severely degraded by noise and are prone to over-fitting to noisy labels, due to the inclusion of erroneous high confidence pseudo-labels generated from poorly calibrated models, thus, rendering threshold-based selection ineffective. Moreover, the combinatorial complexity of the hypothesis space and the error accumulation due to multiple incorrect autoregressive steps posit pseudo-labeling challenging for sequential self-training. To this end, we propose a pseudo-label generation and an uncertainty-based data selection framework for semi-supervised text recognition. We first use Beam-Search inference to yield highly probable hypotheses to assign pseudo-labels to the unlabelled examples. Then we adopt an ensemble of models, sampled by applying dropout, to obtain a robust estimate of the uncertainty associated with the prediction, considering both the character-level and word-level predictive distribution to select good quality pseudo-labels.

However, atmospheric haze severely reduces the visibility of the scene to be analysed, and hence takes a toll on accuracy of higher level applications. Existing methods either utilize additional prior while training, or produce sub-optimal outputs on different densities of haze degradation, due to absence of local and global dependencies in the extracted features. Therefore, it is essential to have a texture preserving algorithm for aerial image dehazing. In light of this, we propose a work that introduces a novel deformable multi-head attention with spatially attentive offset extraction based solution for aerial image dehazing. Here, the deformable multi-head attention is introduced to reconstruct fine level texture in the restored image. We also introduce spatially attentive offset extractor in the deformable convolution for focusing on relevant contextual information. Further, edge boosting skip connections are proposed for effectively passing edge features from shallow layers to deeper layers of the network. Thorough experimentation on synthetic as well as real-world data, along with extensive ablation study, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the prevailing works on aerial image dehazing.

However, we show that Inception-v3 features of the ImageNet dataset are not Gaussian; in particular, every single marginal is not Gaussian. To remedy this problem, we model the featurized images using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and compute the 2-Wasserstein distance restricted to GMMs. We define a performance measure, which we call WaM, on two sets of images by using Inception-v3 (or another classifier) to featurize the images, estimate two GMMs, and use the restricted 2-Wasserstein distance to compare the GMMs. We experimentally show the advantages of WaM over FID, including how FID is more sensitive than WaM to imperceptible image perturbations.

Experimental results on standard indoor and outdoor benchmarks highlight the robustness of our framework, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods when tested with density and distribution equal to the training one while being much more accurate in the other cases.

    "abstract": "Longform media such as movies have complex narrative structures, with events spanning a rich variety of ambient visual scenes. Domain-specific challenges associated with visual scenes in movies include transitions, person coverage, and a wide array of real-life and fictional scenarios. Existing visual scene datasets in movies have limited taxonomies and don't consider the visual scene transition within movie clips. In this work, we address the problem of visual scene recognition in movies by first automatically curating a new and extensive movie-centric taxonomy of 179 scene labels derived from movie scripts and auxiliary web-based video datasets. Instead of manual annotations which can be expensive, we use CLIP to weakly label 1.12 million shots from 32K movie clips based on our proposed taxonomy. We provide baseline visual models trained on the weakly labeled dataset called MovieCLIP and evaluate them on an independent dataset verified by human raters. We show that leveraging features from models pretrained on MovieCLIP benefits downstream tasks such as multi-label scene and genre classification of web videos and movie trailers",

    "title": "Dynamic Re-Weighting for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "The high demand for labeled data that characterizes deep learning is very labor-intensive. Semi-supervised Learning (SSL), acting as one of the breakthroughs, allows for the avoidance of this labeling loss thanks to its small amount of labeled data, alongside extracting information from a large amount of unlabeled data. And there is hope that the same performance for SSL can be achieved when compared to supervised learning methods. Regrettably, the research community has often developed SSL regarding the nature of a balanced data set; in contrast, real data is often imbalanced or even long-tailed. The need to study SSL under imbalance is therefore critical. In this paper, we shall essentially extend FixMatch (a SSL method) to the imbalanced case. We find that the unlabeled data is as well highly imbalanced during the training process; in this respect we propose a re-weighting solution based on the effective number. Furthermore, since prediction uncertainty leads to temporal variations in the number of pseudo-labels, we are innovative in proposing a dynamic re-weighting scheme on the unlabeled data. The simplicity and validity of our method are backed up by strong experimental evidence. Especially on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet127 data sets, our approach provides the strongest results against previous methods across various scales of imbalance",

    "title": "Grounding Scene Graphs on Natural Images via Visio-Lingual Message Passing",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for jointly grounding objects that follow certain semantic relationship constraints given in a scene graph. A typical natural scene contains several objects, often exhibiting visual relationships of varied complexities between them. These inter-object relationships provide strong contextual cues towards improving grounding performance compared to a traditional object query-only-based localization task. A scene graph is an efficient and structured way to represent all the objects and their semantic relationships in the image. In an attempt towards bridging these two modalities representing scenes and utilizing contextual information for improving object localization, we rigorously study the problem of grounding scene graphs on natural images. To this end, we propose a novel graph neural network-based approach referred to as Visio-Lingual Message PAssing Graph Neural Network (VL-MPAG Net). In VL-MPAG Net, we first construct a directed graph with object proposals as nodes and an edge between a pair of nodes representing a plausible relation between them. Then a three-step inter-graph and intra-graph message passing is performed to learn the context-dependent representation of the proposals and query objects. These object representations are used to score the proposals to generate object localization. The proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines on four public datasets",

    "abstract": "Despite the evolution of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), their performance is surprisingly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters. However, it remains challenging to efficiently explore large hyperparameter search space due to the long training times of modern CNNs. Multi-fidelity optimization enables the exploration of more hyperparameter configurations given budget by early termination of unpromising configurations. However, it often results in selecting a sub-optimal configuration as training with the high-performing configuration typically converges slowly in an early phase. In this paper, we propose Multi-fidelity Optimization with a Recurring Learning rate (MORL) which incorporates CNNs' optimization process into multi-fidelity optimization. MORL alleviates the problem of slow-starter and achieves a more precise low-fidelity approximation. Our comprehensive experiments on general image classification, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning demonstrate the effectiveness of MORL over other multi-fidelity optimization methods such as Successive Halving Algorithm (SHA) and Hyperband.

Therefore, TI2Net is a reference-agnostic detector and can be used on unseen datasets. For a video clip of a given identity, identity information in all frames will first be encoded to identity vectors. TI2Net learns the temporal identity embedding from the temporal difference of the identity vectors. The temporal embedding, representing the identity inconsistency in the video clip, is finally used to determine the authenticity of the video clip. During training, TI2Net incorporates triplet loss to learn more discriminative temporal embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed TI2Net. Experimental results indicate that TI2Net generalizes well to unseen manipulations and datasets with unseen identities.

    "title": "ScoreNet: Learning Non-Uniform Attention and Augmentation for Transformer-Based Histopathological Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Progress in digital pathology is hindered by high-resolution images and the prohibitive cost of exhaustive localized annotations. The commonly used paradigm to categorize pathology images is patch-based processing, which often incorporates multiple instance learning MIL to aggregate local patch-level representations yielding image-level prediction. Nonetheless, diagnostically relevant regions may only take a small fraction of the whole tissue, and current MIL-based approaches often process images uniformly, discarding the inter-patches interactions. To alleviate these issues, we propose ScoreNet, a new efficient transformer that exploits a differentiable recommendation stage to extract discriminative image regions and dedicate computational resources accordingly. The proposed transformer leverages the local and global attention of a few dynamically recommended high-resolution regions at an efficient computational cost. We further introduce a novel mixing data-augmentation, namely ScoreMix, by leveraging the image's semantic distribution to guide the data mixing and produce coherent sample-label pairs. ScoreMix is embarrassingly simple and mitigates the pitfalls of previous augmentations, which assume a uniform semantic distribution and risk mislabeling the samples. Thorough experiments and ablation studies on three breast cancer histology datasets of Haematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) have validated the superiority of our approach over prior arts, including transformer-based models on tumour regions-of-interest TRoIs classification. ScoreNet equipped with proposed ScoreMix augmentation demonstrates better generalization capabilities and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with only 50% of the data compared to other mixing augmentation variants. Finally, ScoreNet yields high efficacy and outperforms SOTA efficient transformers, namely TransPath and SwinTransformer, with throughput around 3x and 4x higher than the aforementioned architectures, respectively",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a contrastive learning framework for keypoint detection (CoKe). Keypoint detection differs from other visual tasks where contrastive learning has been applied because the input is a set of images in which multiple keypoints are annotated. This requires the contrastive learning to be extended such that the keypoints are represented and detected independently, which enables the contrastive loss to make the keypoint features different from each other and from the background. Our approach has two benefits: It enables us to exploit the power of contrastive learning for keypoint detection, and by detecting each keypoint independently the detection becomes more robust to occlusion compared to holistic methods, such as stacked hourglass networks, which attempt to detect all keypoints jointly. Our CoKe framework introduces several technical innovations. In particular, we introduce: (i) A clutter bank to represent non-keypoint features; (ii) a keypoint bank that stores prototypical representations of keypoints to approximate the contrastive loss between keypoints; and (iii) a cumulative moving average update to learn the keypoint prototypes while training the feature extractor. Our experiments on a range of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D) show that our approach works as well, or better than, alternative methods for keypoint detection, even for human keypoints, for which the literature is vast.

As a result, published works usually target a particular benchmark, and are not easily comparable to each another. We believe that the development of generalized methods that can tackle multiple tasks requires greater cohesion among these research sub-communities. In this paper, we aim to facilitate this by proposing BURST, a dataset which contains thousands of diverse videos with high-quality object masks, and an associated benchmark with six tasks involving object tracking and segmentation in video. All tasks are evaluated using the same data and comparable metrics, which enables researchers to consider them in unison, and hence, more effectively pool knowledge from different methods across different tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate several baselines for all tasks and show that approaches for one task can be applied to another with a quantifiable and explainable performance difference.

Recent works further improve student network performance by leveraging multiple teacher networks. However, most of the existing knowledge distillation-based multi-teacher methods use separately pretrained teachers. This limits the collaborative learning between teachers and the mutual learning between teachers and student. Network quantization is another at- tractive approach for learning compact DNNs. However, most existing network quantization methods are developed and evaluated without considering multi-teacher support to enhance the performance of quantized student model. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages both multi-teacher knowledge distillation and network quantization for learning low bit-width DNNs. The proposed method encourages both collaborative learning between quantized teachers and mutual learning between quantized teachers and quantized student. During learning process, at corresponding layers, knowledge from teachers will form an importance-aware shared knowledge which will be used as input for teachers at subsequent layers and also be used to guide student. Our experimental results on CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets show that the compact quantized student models trained with our method achieve competitive results compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases, indeed surpass the full precision models",

In this paper, we argue that the random selection of unlabelled training target images to be annotated and included in the support set may not enable an effective fine-tuning process, so we propose a new approach to optimise this image selection process. Our approach involves a new scoring function to find informative unlabelled target images. In particular, we propose to measure the consistency in the model predictions on target images against specific data augmentations. However, we observe that the model trained with source datasets does not reliably evaluate consistency on target images. To alleviate this problem, we propose novel self-supervised pretext tasks to compute the scores of unlabelled target images. Finally, the top few images with the least consistency scores are added to the support set for oracle (i.e., expert) annotation and later used to fine-tune the model to the target images. In our evaluations that involve the segmentation of five different types of cell images, we demonstrate promising results on several target test sets compared to the random selection approach as well as other selection approaches, such as Shannon's entropy and Monte-Carlo dropout.

However, there present many challenges for the existing ultra-FGVC methods, firstly there are always not enough samples in the existing ultra-FGVC datasets based on which the models can easily get overfitting. Secondly, in practice, we are likely to find new species that we have not seen before and need to add them to existing models, which is known as incremental learning. The existing methods solve these problems by Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning (FSCIL), but the main challenge of the FSCIL models on ultra-FGVC tasks lies in their inferior discrimination detection ability since they usually use low-capacity networks to extract features, which leads to insufficient discriminative details extraction from ultra-fine-grained images. In this paper, a self-supervised feature enhancement for the few-shot incremental learning network (SSFE-Net) is proposed to solve this problem. Specifically, a self-supervised learning (SSL) and knowledge distillation (KD) framework is developed to enhance the feature extraction of the low-capacity backbone network for ultra-FGVC few-shot class incremental learning tasks. Besides, we for the first time create a series of benchmarks for FSCIL tasks on two public ultra-FGVC datasets and three normal fine-grained datasets, which will facilitate the development of the Ultra-FGVC community.

The availability of large scale hand-labeled datasets and sufficient computing resources made it possible to train powerful deep neural networks, reaching very low Word Error Rate (WER) on academic benchmarks. However, despite impressive performance on clean audio samples, a drop of performance is often observed on noisy speech. In this work, we propose to improve the noise robustness of the recently proposed Efficient Conformer Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based architecture by processing both audio and visual modalities. We improve previous lip reading methods using an Efficient Conformer back-end on top of a ResNet-18 visual front-end and by adding intermediate CTC losses between blocks. We condition intermediate block features on early predictions using Inter CTC residual modules to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC-based models. We also replace the Efficient Conformer grouped attention by a more efficient and simpler attention mechanism that we call patch attention. We experiment with publicly available Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) datasets.

To remedy this problem, we propose a novel memory economy attention mechanism named Couplformer, which decouples the attention map into two sub-matrices and generates the alignment scores from spatial information. Our method enables the Transformer model to improve time and memory efficiency while maintaining expressive power. A series of different scale image classification tasks are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of our model. The result of experiments shows that on the ImageNet-1K classification task, the Couplformer can significantly decrease 42% memory consumption compared with the regular Transformer. Meanwhile, it accesses sufficient accuracy requirements, which outperforms 0.56% on Top-1 accuracy and occupies the same memory footprint. Besides, the Couplformer achieves state-of-art performance in MS COCO 2017 object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers has demonstrated competitive performance on computer vision tasks benefiting from their ability to capture long-range dependencies with multi-head self-attention modules and multi-layer perceptron. However, calculating global attention brings another disadvantage compared with convolutional neural networks, i.e. requiring much more data and computations to converge, which makes it difficult to generalize well on small datasets, which is common in practical applications. Previous works are either focusing on transferring knowledge from large datasets or adjusting the structure for small datasets. After carefully examining the self-attention modules, we discover that the number of trivial attention weights is far greater than the important ones and the accumulated trivial weights are dominating the attention in Vision Transformers due to their large quantity, which is not handled by the attention itself. This will cover useful non-trivial attention and harm the performance when trivial attention includes more noise, e.g. in shallow layers for some backbones. To solve this issue, we proposed to divide attention weights into trivial and non-trivial ones by thresholds, then Suppressing Accumulated Trivial Attention (SATA) weights by proposed Trivial WeIghts Suppression Transformation (TWIST) to reduce attention noise. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets show that our suppressing method boosts the accuracy of Vision Transformers by up to 2.3%.

    "title": "Cross-Modal Semantic Enhanced Interaction for Image-Sentence Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Image-sentence retrieval has attracted extensive research attention in multimedia and computer vision due to its promising application. The key issue lies in jointly learning the visual and textual representation to accurately estimate their similarity. To this end, the mainstream schema adopts an object-word based attention to calculate their relevance scores and refine their interactive representations with the attention features, which, however, neglects the context of the object representation on the inter-object relationship that matches the predicates in sentences. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Semantic Enhanced Interaction method, termed CMSEI for image-sentence retrieval, which correlates the intra- and inter-modal semantics between objects and words. In particular, we first design the intra-modal spatial and semantic graphs based reasoning to enhance the semantic representations of objects guided by the explicit relationships of the objects' spatial positions and their scene graph. Then the visual and textual semantic representations are refined jointly via the inter-modal interactive attention and the cross-modal alignment. To correlate the context of objects with the textual context, we further refine the visual semantic representation via the cross-level object-sentence and word-image based interactive attention. Experimental results on seven standard evaluation metrics show that the proposed CMSEI outperforms the state-of-the-art and the alternative approaches on MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Recent object detection models have proved valuable for many robotics and manufacturing tasks, but they require large amounts of annotated data for each new class of objects they are trained for. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to address this problem by learning novel classes given only a few samples of annotated data. While competitive results have been achieved using two-stage FSOD detectors, typically faster one-stage FSODs underperform in comparison. We make the discovery that the large gap in performance between two-stage and one-stage FSODs is mainly due to their weak discriminability, which is explained away by a small post-fusion receptive field and a small number of foreground samples in the loss function. We propose a new one-stage FSOD framework to address these limitations - Few-shot RetinaNet (FSRN). Specifically, we propose: (1) a multi-way support training strategy to augment the number of foreground samples for dense meta-detectors during training, (2) an early multi-level feature fusion providing a wide receptive field that covers the whole anchor area, (3) two augmentation techniques on query and source images to enhance transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach addresses the limitations of previous methods and boosts both discriminability and transferability. FSRN is two times faster than twostage FSODs while remaining competitive in accuracy, and it triples the state-of-the-art of one-stage meta-detectors on the competitive 10-shot MS-COCO benchmark. On the PASCAL VOC benchmark, the proposed approach consistently outperforms one-stage meta-detectors and many two-stage FSODs",

We propose LayerDoc, an approach that uses visual features, textual semantics, and spatial coordinates along with constraint inference to extract the hierarchical layout structure of documents in a bottom-up layer-wise fashion. LayerDoc recursively groups smaller regions into larger semantic elements in 2D to infer complex nested hierarchies.

Most current endeavors focus on completely cutting the researcher out of the picture by generating highly generalized models. However, these models invariably fail when faced with novel data, distributed differently than the ones used for training. Rather than approaching the problem with methods that presume the availability of large amounts of target data and computing power for retraining, in this work we address the even greater challenge of designing an approach that requires minimal amounts of new annotated data as well as training time. We do so by designing specialized contrastive losses that leverage the few annotated samples very efficiently. A large set of results show that 3 to 5 annotations lead to models with accuracy that: 1) significantly mitigate the covariate shift effects; 2) matches or surpasses other adaptation methods; 3) even approaches methods that have been fully retrained on the target distribution. The adaptation training is only a few minutes, paving a path towards a balance between model performance, computing requirements and expert-level annotation needs",

When appearance features are unreliable and geometric features are confused by irregular motions, applying conventional Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) methods may generate unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, our C-BIoU tracker adds buffers to expand the matching space of detections and tracks, which mitigates the effect of irregular motions in two aspects: one is to directly match identical but non-overlapping detections and tracks in adjacent frames, and the other is to compensate for the motion estimation bias in the matching space. In addition, to reduce the risk of overexpansion of the matching space, cascaded matching is employed: first matching alive tracks and detections with a small buffer, and then matching unmatched tracks and detections with a large buffer. Despite its simplicity, our C-BIoU tracker works surprisingly well and achieves state-of-the-art results on MOT datasets that focus on irregular motions and indistinguishable appearances. Moreover, the C-BIoU tracker is the dominant component for our 2nd place solution in the CVPR'22 SoccerNet MOT and the ECCV'22 MOTComplex DanceTrack challenges.

This study proposes a novel method for self-supervised low-dose CT denoising to alleviate the requirement of paired LDCT and NDCT images.

We have shown the aforementioned is similar to training a neural network to minimize the distance between clean NDCT and noisy LDCT image pairs. Again, during the reverse mapping of the invertible network, the output image is mapped to the original input image, similar to cycle consistency loss. Finally, the trained invertible network's forward mapping is used for denoising LDCT images.

Our goal is to design an attack strategy that can learn from such natural scenes by leveraging the local patch differences that occur inherently in such images (eg. difference between the local patch on the object 'person' and the object 'bike' in a traffic scene). Our key idea is to misclassify an adversarial multi-object image by confusing the victim classifier for each local patch in the image.

Since generic image understanding involves solving multiple tasks, it is natural to aim at generating images via multi conditioning.

In this work, we propose a novel neural architecture to address the problem of heterogeneity and sparsity of the spatially multi-conditional labels. Our choice of spatial conditioning, such as by semantics and depth, is driven by the promise it holds for better control of the image generation process. The proposed method uses a transformer-like architecture operating pixel-wise, which receives the available labels as input tokens to merge them in a learned homogeneous space of labels. The merged labels are then used for image generation via conditional generative adversarial training. In this process, the sparsity of the labels is handled by simply dropping the input tokens corresponding to the missing labels at the desired locations, thanks to the proposed pixel-wise operating architecture.

    "abstract": "Existing object detection models assume both the training and test data are sampled from the same source domain. This assumption does not hold true when these detectors are deployed in real-world applications, where they encounter new visual domains. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods are generally employed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by domain shift. Existing UDA methods operate in an offline manner where the model is first adapted toward the target domain and then deployed in real-world applications. However, this offline adaptation strategy is not suitable for real-world applications as the model frequently encounters new domain shifts. Hence, it is critical to develop a feasible UDA method that generalizes to the new domain shifts encountered during deployment time in a continuous online manner. To this end, we propose a novel unified adaptation framework that adapts and improves generalization on the target domain in both offline and online settings. Specifically, we introduce MemXformer - a cross-attention transformer-based memory module where items in the memory take advantage of domain shifts and record prototypical patterns of the target distribution. Further, MemXformer produces strong positive and negative pairs to guide a novel contrastive loss, which enhances target-specific representation learning.

This data-driven approach is similar to that used in physics to discover general laws from data. We used a symbolic regression method to automatically find a mathematical expression highly correlated with a linear classifier's accuracy. The formula discovered on more than 260 datasets of embeddings has a Pearson's correlation of 0.96 and a r2 of 0.93.

We find that the multi-view consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions and high-dynamic-range imaging",

    "abstract": "A single-shot multispectral camera equipped with an optimized color filter array (CFA) has the potential to deliver a fast and low-cost hyperspectral (HS) imaging system. Previous solutions are largely restricted to designing demosaicing algorithms for fixed CFAs - be it the Bayer color pattern or evenly-spaced spectral multiplexing patterns. Since sampling and reconstruction are tightly-coupled, the ability to search for an optimal solution is severely constrained by using predefined CFAs. In this work, we simultaneously address the problem of spectral band selection, CFA design, image demosaicing, and spectral image recovery in a joint learning framework for single-shot HS imaging. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method for spectral band selection and a novel neural network for CFA generation, image demosaicing, and HS image recovery. The final spectral reconstruction accuracy is used to supervise the training of the main network to maximize the synergies between those tightly-related tasks. The RL method regards the main network as an agent to collect reward. Our final method delivers a simple setup - as simple as an RGB camera - for HS imaging.

We argue that depending on the application, users of image retrieval systems have different and changing similarity notions that should be incorporated as easily as possible. Therefore, we present Language-Guided Zero-Shot Deep Metric Learning (LanZ-DML) as a new DML setting in which users control the aspects that should be important for image representations without training data by only using natural language. To this end, we propose InDiReCT (Image representations using Dimensionality Reduction on CLIP embedded Texts), a model for LanZ-DML on images that exclusively uses a few text prompts for training. InDiReCT utilizes CLIP as a fixed feature extractor for images and texts and transfers the variation in text prompt embeddings to the image embedding space. Extensive experiments on five datasets and overall thirteen similarity notions show that, despite not seeing any images during training, InDiReCT performs better than strong baselines and approaches the performance of fully-supervised models. An analysis reveals that InDiReCT learns to focus on regions of the image that correlate with the desired similarity notion, which makes it a fast to train and easy to use method to create custom embedding spaces only using natural language",

To address this issue, we propose a novel attention-based decoder, namely CASCaded Attention DEcoder (CASCADE), which leverages the multiscale features of hierarchical vision transformers.

We use a multi-stage feature and loss aggregation framework due to their faster convergence and better performance. Our experiments demonstrate that transformers with CASCADE significantly outperform state-of-the-art CNN- and transformer-based approaches, obtaining up to 5.07% and 6.16% improvements in DICE and mIoU scores, respectively.

    "abstract": "When deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) to a device, it is traditionally assumed that available computational resources (compute, memory, and power) remain static. However, real-world computing systems do not always provide stable resource guarantees. Computational resources need to be conserved when load from other processes is high, or available memory is low. In this work, we present a training procedure to produce DNNs that can be compressed in real-time to arbitrary compression levels entirely on-device. This enables the deployment of a single model that can efficiently adapt to its host device's available resources. We formulate this problem as learning an adaptively compressible network subspace, where one end is optimized for accuracy, and the other for efficiency. Our subspace model requires no recalibration nor retraining when changing compression levels. Moreover, our generic training framework is amenable to multiple forms of compression, and we present results for unstructured sparsity, structured sparsity, and quantization on a variety of architectures. We present models that require a single extra copy of network parameters, as well as models that require no extra parameters. Both models allow for operation at any compression level within a wide range (for example, 0% to 90% for structured sparsity with ResNet18 on ImageNet). At each compression level, our models achieve an accuracy comparable to a baseline model optimized for that particular compression level. To our knowledge, our method is the first to enable adaptive on-device network compression with little to no computational overhead",

To make use of this complementary nature of shadow detection and removal tasks, we train an auxiliary network for shadow removal and propose a complementary feature learning block (CFL) to learn and fuse meaningful features from shadow removal network to the shadow detection network. We train the proposed network, FCSD-Net, using the R2D learning strategy across multiple datasets. Experimental results on three public shadow detection datasets (ISTD, SBU and UCF) show that our method improves the shadow detection performance while being able to detect fine context better compared to the other recent methods.

As the presence of all other classes is unknown, we propose an Expected Negative loss that builds a set of expected negative labels in addition to the annotated positives.

Moreover, the crop data-augmentation leads to additional label noise by cropping out the single annotated object.

To this end, we propose a novel multimodal multi-head convolutional attention module to super-resolve CT and MRI scans. Our attention module uses the convolution operation to perform joint spatial-channel attention on multiple concatenated input tensors, where the kernel (receptive field) size controls the reduction rate of the spatial attention, and the number of convolutional filters controls the reduction rate of the channel attention, respectively. We introduce multiple attention heads, each head having a distinct receptive field size corresponding to a particular reduction rate for the spatial attention. We integrate our multimodal multi-head convolutional attention (MMHCA) into two deep neural architectures for super-resolution and conduct experiments on three data sets. Our empirical results show the superiority of our attention module over the state-of-the-art attention mechanisms used in super-resolution.

    "abstract": "Self supervised learning (SSL) has become a very successful technique to harness the power of unlabeled data, with no annotation effort. A number of developed approaches are evolving with the goal of outperforming supervised alternatives, which have been relatively successful. Similar to some other disciplines in deep representation learning, one main issue in SSL is robustness of the approaches under different settings. In this paper, for the first time, we recognize the fundamental limits of SSL coming from the use of a single-supervisory signal. To address this limitation, we leverage the power of uncertainty representation to devise a robust and general standard hierarchical learning/training protocol for any SSL baseline, regard- less of their assumptions and approaches. Essentially, using the information bottleneck principle, we decompose feature learning into a two-stage training procedure, each with a distinct supervision signal. This double supervision approach is captured in two key steps: 1) invariance enforcement to data augmentation, and 2) fuzzy pseudo labeling (both hard and soft annotation). This simple, yet, effective protocol which enables cross-class/cluster feature learning, is instantiated via an initial training of an ensemble of models through invariance enforcement to data augmentation as first training phase, and then assigning fuzzy labels to the original samples for the second training phase. We consider multiple alternative scenarios with double supervision and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on recent baselines, covering four different SSL paradigms, including geometrical, contrastive, non-contrastive, and hard/soft whitening (redundancy reduction) baselines.

The proposed self-attention module uses patch embedding, multi-head self-attention, and spatial-channel restoration, followed by sigmoid activation and exponential soft-max. This self-attention mechanism efficiently aggregates dependencies between non-local activation patches during down-sampling. Extensive experiments on standard object classification and detection tasks with various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures demonstrate the superiority of our proposed mechanism over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) pooling techniques.

Through self-distillation, the intermediate layers are better suited for instance discrimination, making the performance of an early-exited sub-network not much degraded from that of the full network. This renders the pretext task easier also for the final layer, lead to better representations. Our method, Self-Distilled Self-Supervised Learning (SDSSL), outperforms competitive baselines (SimCLR, BYOL and MoCo v3) using ViT on various tasks and datasets. In the linear evaluation and k-NN protocol, SDSSL not only leads to superior performance in the final layers, but also in most of the lower layers. Furthermore, qualitative and quantative analyses show how representations are formed more effectively along the transformer layers. Code will be available",

We refer to this joint training as Composite Learning (CompL). Experiments of CompL on monocular depth estimation, semantic segmentation, and boundary detection show consistent performance improvements in fully and partially labeled datasets. Further analysis on depth estimation reveals that joint training with self-supervision outperforms most labeled auxiliary tasks. We also find that CompL can improve model robustness when the models are evaluated in new domains. These results demonstrate the benefits of self-supervision as an auxiliary task, and establish the design of novel task-specific self-supervised methods as a new axis of investigation for future multi-task learning research",

The performance of existing methods varies depending on the characteristics of the incremental process. To date, there is no other approach than to test all pairs of learning algorithms and neural architectures on the training data available at the start of the learning process to select a suited algorithm-architecture combination. To tackle this problem, in this article, we introduce AdvisIL, a method which takes as input the main characteristics of the incremental process (memory budget for the deep model, initial number of classes, size of incremental steps) and recommends an adapted pair of learning algorithm and neural architecture. The recommendation is based on a similarity between the user-provided settings and a large set of pre-computed experiments. AdvisIL makes class-incremental learning easier, since users do not need to run cumbersome experiments to design their system. We evaluate our method on four datasets under six incremental settings and three deep model sizes. We compare six algorithms and three deep neural architectures. Results show that AdvisIL has better overall performance than any of the individual combinations of a learning algorithm and a neural architecture.

To alleviate this, we propose to dispense sign(), replacing it with a learnable activation binarizer (LAB), allowing the network to learn a fine-grained binarization kernel per layer - as opposed to global thresholding. LAB is a novel universal module that can seamlessly be integrated into existing architectures. To confirm this, we plug it into four seminal BNNs and show a considerable performance boost at the cost of tolerable increase in delay and complexity.

    "abstract": "Most action recognition models today are highly parameterized, and evaluated on datasets with appearance-wise distinct classes. It has also been shown that 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) tend to be biased toward texture rather than shape in still image recognition tasks, in contrast to humans. Taken together, this raises suspicion that large video models partly learn spurious spatial texture correlations rather than to track relevant shapes over time to infer generalizable semantics from their movement. A natural way to avoid parameter explosion when learning visual patterns over time is to make use of recurrence. Biological vision consists of abundant recurrent circuitry, and is superior to computer vision in terms of domain shift generalization. In this article, we empirically study whether the choice of low-level temporal modeling has consequences for texture bias and cross-domain robustness. In order to enable a light-weight and systematic assessment of the ability to capture temporal structure, not revealed from single frames, we provide the Temporal Shape (TS) dataset, as well as modified domains of Diving48 allowing for the investigation of spatial texture bias in video models. The combined results of our experiments indicate that sound physical inductive bias such as recurrence in temporal modeling may be advantageous when robustness to domain shift is important for the task",

Therefore, we propose a novel augmentation strategy, adaptive Positive or Negative Data Augmentation (PNDA), in which an original and its rotated image are a positive pair if they are semantically close and a negative pair if they are semantically different. To achieve PNDA, we first determine whether rotation is positive or negative on an image-by-image basis in an unsupervised way. Then, we apply PNDA to contrastive learning frameworks.

    "abstract": "We focus on the task of far-field 3D detection (Far3Det) of objects beyond a certain distance from an observer, e.g., >50m. Far3Det is particularly important for autonomous vehicles (AVs) operating at highway speeds, which require detections of far-field obstacles to ensure sufficient braking distances. However, contemporary AV benchmarks such as nuScenes underemphasize this problem because they evaluate performance only up to a certain distance (50m). One reason is that obtaining far-field 3D annotations is difficult, particularly for lidar sensors that produce very few point returns for far-away objects. Indeed, we find that almost 50% of far-field objects (beyond 50m) contain zero lidar points. Secondly, current metrics for 3D detection employ a \"one-size-fits-all\" philosophy, using the same tolerance thresholds for near and far objects, inconsistent with tolerances for both human vision and stereo disparities. Both factors lead to an incomplete analysis of the Far3Det task. For example, while conventional wisdom tells us that high-resolution RGB sensors should be vital for the 3D detection of far-away objects, lidar-based methods still rank higher compared to RGB counterparts on the current benchmark leaderboards. As a first step towards a Far3Det benchmark, we develop a method to find well-annotated scenes from the nuScenes dataset and derive a well-annotated far-field validation set. We also propose a Far3Det evaluation protocol and explore various 3D detection methods for Far3Det. Our result convincingly justifies the long held conventional wisdom that high-resolution RGB improves 3D detection in the far-field. We further propose a simple yet effective method that fuses detections from RGB and lidar detectors based on non-maximum suppression, which remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors in the far-field",

    "abstract": "Many people with some form of hearing loss consider lipreading as their primary mode of day-to-day communication. However, finding resources to learn or improve one's lipreading skills can be challenging. This is further exacerbated in the COVID19 pandemic due to restrictions on direct interactions with peers and speech therapists. Today, online MOOCs platforms like Coursera and Udemy have become the most effective form of training for many types of skill development. However, online lipreading resources are scarce as creating such resources is an extensive process needing months of manual effort to record hired actors. Because of the manual pipeline, such platforms are also limited in vocabulary, supported languages, accents, and speakers and have a high usage cost. In this work, we investigate the possibility of replacing real human talking videos with synthetically generated videos. Synthetic data can easily incorporate larger vocabularies, variations in accent, and even local languages and many speakers. We propose an end-to-end automated pipeline to develop such a platform using state-of-the-art talking head video generator networks, text-to-speech models, and computer vision techniques. We then perform an extensive human evaluation using carefully thought out lipreading exercises to validate the quality of our designed platform against the existing lipreading platforms.

The key insight of ReCo is to allow a relaxed negative space by not penalizing unpaired multimodal samples (ie, negative pairs) that are already orthogonal or negatively correlated. Unlike the widely-used InfoNCE, which keeps repelling negative pairs as long as they are not anti-correlated, ReCo by design embraces more diversity and flexibility of the learned embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments using ReCo with state-of-the-art models by pretraining on the MIMIC-CXR dataset that consists of chest radiographs and free-text radiology reports, and evaluating on the CheXpert dataset for multimodal retrieval and disease classification. Our ReCo achieves an absolute improvement of 2.9% over the InfoNCE baseline on the CheXpert Retrieval dataset in average retrieval precision and reports better or comparable performance in the linear evaluation and finetuning for classification.

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results on an abundance of robotic tasks in simulation, including visual navigation and manipulation. Prior work generally aims to build embodied agents that solve their assigned tasks as quickly as possible, while largely ignoring the problems caused by collision with objects during interaction. This lack of prioritization is understandable: there is no inherent cost in breaking virtual objects. As a result, \"well-trained\" agents frequently collide with objects before achieving their primary goals, a behavior that would be catastrophic in the real world. In this paper, we study the problem of training agents to complete the task of visual mobile manipulation in the ManipulaTHOR environment while avoiding unnecessary collision (disturbance) with objects. We formulate disturbance avoidance as a penalty term in the reward function, but find that directly training with such penalized rewards often results in agents being unable to escape poor local optima. Instead, we propose a two-stage training curriculum where an agent is first allowed to freely explore and build basic competencies without penalization, after which a disturbance penalty is introduced to refine the agent's behavior. Results on testing scenes show that our curriculum not only avoids these poor local optima, but also leads to 10% absolute gains in success rate without disturbance, compared to our state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, our curriculum is significantly more performant than a safe RL algorithm that casts collision avoidance as a constraint.

Self-training combined with cross-domain mixed sampling has shown remarkable performance gain in semantic segmentation in UDA (unsupervised domain adaptation) context. Motivated by this fact, we propose an approach for human action detection in videos that transfers knowledge from the source domain (annotated dataset) to the target domain (unannotated dataset) using mixed sampling and pseudo-label-based selftraining. The existing UDA techniques follow a ClassMix algorithm for semantic segmentation. However, simply adopting ClassMix for action detection does not work, mainly because these are two entirely different problems, i.e., pixel-label classification vs. instance-label detection. To tackle this, we propose a novel action instance mixed sampling technique that combines information across domains based on action instances instead of action classes. Moreover, we propose a new UDA training protocol that addresses the long-tail sample distribution and domain shift problem by using supervision from an auxiliary source domain (ASD). For the ASD, we propose a new action detection dataset with dense frame-level annotations. We name our proposed framework as domain-adaptive action instance mixing (DA-AIM).

In this domain, low-rank approximation is a promising method, but existing solutions considered a restricted number of design choices and failed to efficiently explore the design space, which lead to severe accuracy degradation and limited compression ratio achieved. To address the above limitations, this work proposes the SVD-NAS framework that couples the domains of low-rank approximation and neural architecture search. SVD-NAS generalises and expands the design choices of previous works by introducing the Low-Rank architecture space, LR-space, which is a more fine-grained design space of low-rank approximation. Afterwards, this work proposes a gradient-descent-based search for efficiently traversing the LR-space. This finer and more thorough exploration of the possible design choices results in improved accuracy as well as reduction in parameters, FLOPS, and latency of a CNN model.

While these algorithms work great with from-sc ratch trained models on widely used CL benchmarks, they show dramatic performance drops on more complex datasets (e.g., Split-CUB200). Pre-trained models, widely used to transfer knowledge to downstream tasks, could enhance these methods to be applicable in more realistic scenarios. However, surprisingly, improvements in CL algorithms from pre-training are inconsistent. For instance, while Incremental Classifier and Representation Learning (iCaRL) underperforms Supervised Contrastive Replay (SCR) when trained from scratch, it outperforms SCR when both are initialized with a pre-trained model. This indicates the paradigm current CL literature follows, where all methods are compared in from-scratch training, is not well reflective of the true CL objective and desired progress. Furthermore, we found 1) CL algorithms that exert less regularization benefit more from a pre-trained model; 2) a model pre-trained with a larger dataset (WebImageText in Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vs. ImageNet) does not guarantee a better improvement. Based on these findings, we introduced a simple yet effective baseline that employs minimum regularization and leverages the more beneficial pre-trained model, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods when pre-training is applied.

    "title": "Cross-Domain Video Anomaly Detection Without Target Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Most cross-domain unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) works assume that at least few task-relevant target domain training data are available for adaptation from the source to the target domain. However, this requires laborious model-tuning by the end-user who may prefer to have a system that works \"out-of-the-box\". To address such practical scenarios, we identify a novel target domain (inference-time) VAD task where no target domain training data are available. To this end, we propose a new 'Zero-shot Cross-domain Video Anomaly Detection (zxvad)' framework that includes a future-frame prediction generative model setup. Different from prior future-frame prediction models, our model uses a novel Normalcy Classifier module to learn the features of normal event videos by learning how such features are different \"relative\" to features in pseudo-abnormal examples. A novel Untrained Convolutional Neural Network based Anomaly Synthesis module crafts these pseudo-abnormal examples by adding foreign objects in normal video frames with no extra training cost. With our novel relative normalcy feature learning strategy, zxvad generalizes and learns to distinguish between normal and abnormal frames in a new target domain without adaptation during inference. Through evaluations on common datasets, we show that zxvad outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA), regardless of whether task-relevant (i.e., VAD) source training data are available or not. Lastly, zxvad also beats the SOTA methods in inference-time efficiency metrics including the model size, total parameters, GPU energy consumption, and GMACs",

In this paper, we propose Test-Time Self-Training (TeST): a technique that takes as input a model trained on some source data and a novel data distribution at test time, and learns invariant and robust representations using a student-teacher framework. We find that models adapted using TeST significantly improve over baseline test-time adaptation algorithms. TeST achieves competitive performance to modern domain adaptation algorithms [4,43], while having access to 5-10x less data at time of adaption. We thoroughly evaluate a variety of baselines on two tasks: object detection and image segmentation and find that models adapted with TeST.

The source-free approach leverages target pseudo labels, which can be noisy, to improve the target adaptation. We introduce consistency between label preserving augmentations and utilize pseudo label refinement methods to reduce noisy pseudo labels. Further, we propose novel MixUp Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for better generalization on multiple target domains using various source-free STDA models.

In this paper, we propose the Temporal Feature Enhancement Dilated Convolution Network (TFE-DCN) to address these two limitations. The proposed TFE-DCN has an enlarged receptive field that covers a long temporal span to observe the full dynamics of action instances, which makes it powerful to capture temporal dependencies between snippets.

    "abstract": "Deep metric learning for vision is trained by optimizing a representation network to map (non-)matching image pairs to (non-)similar representations. During testing, which typically corresponds to image retrieval, both database and query examples are processed by the same network to obtain the representation used for similarity estimation and ranking. In this work, we explore an asymmetric setup by light-weight processing of the query at a small image resolution to enable fast representation extraction. The goal is to obtain a network for database examples that is trained to operate on large resolution images and benefits from fine-grained image details, and a second network for query examples that operates on small resolution images but preserves a representation space aligned with that of the database network. We achieve this with a distillation approach that transfers knowledge from a fixed teacher network to a student via a loss that operates per image and solely relies on coupled augmentations without the use of any labels. In contrast to prior work that explores such asymmetry from the point of view of different network architectures, this work uses the same architecture but modifies the image resolution. We conclude that resolution asymmetry is a better way to optimize the performance/efficiency trade-off than architecture asymmetry.

Ablation studies further demonstrate that Serf based architectures perform better than those of Swish and Mish in varying scenarios, validating the effectiveness and compatibility of Serf with varying depth, complexity, optimizers, learning rates, batch sizes, initializers and dropout rates. Finally, we investigate the mathematical relation between Swish and Serf, thereby showing the impact of preconditioner function ingrained in the first derivative of Serf which provides a regularization effect making gradients smoother and optimization faster",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce AVE-CLIP, a novel framework that integrates the AudioCLIP pre-trained on large-scale audio-visual data with a multi-window temporal transformer to effectively operate on different temporal scales of video frames. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We introduce a multi-stage training framework to incorporate AudioCLIP pre-trained with audio-image pairs into the AVE localization task on video frames through contrastive fine-tuning, effective mean video feature extraction, and multi-scale training phases. (2) We propose a multi-domain attention mechanism that operates on both temporal and feature domains over varying timescales to fuse the local and global feature variations.

However, it is not clear from current literature which of these methods allows for better generalization to unseen data from the wild. Therefore, in this work, we present an evaluation framework in which the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art UDA and DG methods can be compared fairly. From this evaluation, we find that UDA methods, which leverage unlabeled data, outperform DG methods in terms of generalization, and can deliver similar performance on unseen data as fully-supervised training methods that require all data to be labeled.

This is achieved by transferring the knowledge learned from semantically-related seen activities.

In this paper, we design a transformer-based framework titled TranZAD, which streamlines the detection of unseen activities by casting ZSTAD as a direct set-prediction problem, removing the need for hand-crafted designs and manual post-processing. We show how a semantic information-guided contrastive learning strategy can effectively train TranZAD for the zero-shot setting, enabling the efficient transfer of knowledge from the seen to the unseen activities. To reduce confusion between unseen activities and unrelated background information in videos, we introduce a more efficient method of computing the background class embedding by dynamically adapting it as part of the end-to-end learning. Additionally, unlike existing work on ZSTAD, we do not assume the knowledge of which classes are unseen during training and use the visual and semantic information of only the seen classes for the knowledge transfer.

The walk-through screening system aims to ensure security in crowded areas by performing CWD on walking persons, hence it requires an accurate and real-time detection approach. To ensure accuracy, a weapon needs to be detected irrespective of its 3D orientation, thus we use the 3D radar images as detection input. For achieving real-time, we reformulate classic U-Net based segmentation networks to perform 3D detection tasks. Our 3D segmentation network predicts peak-shaped probability map, instead of voxel-wise masks, to enable position inference by elementary peak detection operation on the predicted map. In the peak-shaped probability map, the peak marks the weapon's position. So, weapon detection task translates to peak detection on the probability map. A Gaussian function is used to model weapons in the probability map. We experimentally validate our approach on realistic 3D radar images obtained from a walk-through weapon screening system prototype. Extensive ablation studies verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach over existing conventional approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach can perform accurate and real-time CWD, thus making it suitable for practical applications of walk-through screening",

To tackle this problem, we investigate forward and backward motion continuity between adjacent frames and propose a new video anomaly detection paradigm based on bi-directional frame interpolation. The proposed framework consists of an optical flow estimation network and an interpolation network jointly optimized end-to-end to synthesize a middle frame from its nearest two frames. We further introduce a novel dynamic memory mechanism to balance memory sparsity and normality representation diversity, which attenuates abnormal features in frame interpolation without affecting normal prototypes. In inference, interpolation error and dynamic memory error are fused as anomaly scores. The proposed bi-directional interpolation design improves normal frame synthesis, lowering the false alarm rate of anomaly appearance; meanwhile, the implicit \"regular\" motion constraint in our optical flow estimation and the novel dynamic memory mechanism play blocking roles in interpolating abnormal frames, increasing the system's sensitivity to anomalies. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over prior arts",

    "abstract": "Designing robust algorithms capable of training accurate neural networks on uncurated datasets from the web has been the subject of much research as it reduces the need for time consuming human labor. The focus of many previous research contributions has been on the detection of different types of label noise; however, this paper proposes to improve the correction accuracy of noisy samples once they have been detected. In many state-of-the-art contributions, a two phase approach is adopted where the noisy samples are detected before guessing a corrected pseudo-label in a semi-supervised fashion. The guessed pseudo-labels are then used in the supervised objective without ensuring that the label guess is likely to be correct. This can lead to confirmation bias, which reduces the noise robustness. Here we propose the pseudo-loss, a simple metric that we find to be strongly correlated with pseudo-label correctness on noisy samples. Using the pseudo-loss, we dynamically down weight under-confident pseudo-labels throughout training to avoid confirmation bias and improve the network accuracy. We additionally propose to use a confidence guided contrastive objective that learns robust representation on an interpolated objective between class bound (supervised) for confidently corrected samples and unsupervised representation for under-confident label corrections. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our Pseudo-Loss Selection (PLS) algorithm on a variety of benchmark datasets including curated data synthetically corrupted with in-distribution and out-of-distribution noise, and two real world web noise datasets.

More collected data leads to more concerns about data privacy, including but not limited to pedestrian faces and surrounding vehicle license plates, which urges for robust solutions for detecting and anonymizing them in realistic road-driving scenarios. Existing public datasets for both face and license plate detection are either not focused on autonomous driving or only in parking lots. In this paper, we introduce a challenging public dataset for face and license plate detection in autonomous driving domain. The dataset is aggregated from visual data that is available in public domain, to cover scenarios from six European cities, including daytime and nighttime, annotated with both faces and license plates. All of the images feature a variety of poses and sizes for both faces and license plates. Our dataset offers not only a benchmark for evaluating data anonymization models but also data to get more insights about privacy-preserving autonomous driving. The experimental results showed that 1) current generic state-of-the-art face and/or license plate detection models do not perform well on a realistic and diverse road-driving dataset like ours, 2) our model trained with autonomous driving data (even with soft-labeling data) outperformed strong but generic models, and 3) the size of faces and license plates is an important factor for evaluating and optimizing the performance of privacy-preserving autonomous driving.

The tiny, fuzzy camouflaged objects result in visually indistinguishable properties. However, current single-view COD detectors are sensitive to background distractors. Therefore, blurred boundaries and variable shapes of the camouflaged objects are challenging to be fully captured with a single-view detector. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a behavior-inspired framework, called Multi-view Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), which mimics the human behaviors of finding indistinct objects in images, i.e., observing from multiple angles, distances, perspectives. Specifically, the key idea behind it is to generate multiple ways of observation (multi-view) by data augmentation and apply them as inputs. MFFN captures critical boundary and semantic information by comparing and fusing extracted multi-view features. In addition, our MFFN exploits the dependence and interaction between views and channels. Specifically, our methods leverage the complementary information between different views through a two-stage attention module called Co-attention of Multi-view (CAMV). And we design a local-overall module called Channel Fusion Unit (CFU) to explore the channel-wise contextual clues of diverse feature maps in an iterative manner.

In Fed-Star, a client receives weights from all other clients, updates its local weights through pre-aggregation (to address statistical heterogeneity) and local training, and sends its updated local weights to all other clients, thus forming a star-like topology.

The proposed method can achieve increased adversarial robustness on a primary dataset by leveraging auxiliary datasets via multi-domain learning.

Moreover, we demonstrate that while existing methods are vulnerable to negative transfer due to the distributional discrepancy between auxiliary and primary data, the proposed method enables neural networks to flexibly leverage diverse image datasets for adversarial training by successfully handling the domain discrepancy through the application of a confidence-based selection strategy.

In this paper, we present a novel method to resolve the ambiguity of confidence scores with the guidance of network pruning. A recent finding showed that network pruning severely impairs the network generalization ability on samples that are not yet well learned or represented. Inspired by this finding, we refine the confidence scores by reflecting the extent to which the predictions are affected by pruning. Furthermore, we adopted a curriculum learning strategy for the confidence score, which enables the network to learn gradually from easy to hard samples. This approach resolves the ambiguity by suppressing the learning of noisy pseudo-labels, the confidence scores of which are difficult to trust owing to insufficient training in the early stages.

This paper focuses on texture images and considers how few normal samples are needed for accurate AD. We first highlight the critical nature of the problem that previous studies have overlooked: accurate detection gets harder for anisotropic textures when image orientations are not aligned between inputs and normal samples. We then propose a zero-shot method, which detects anomalies without using a normal sample. The method is free from the issue of unaligned orientation between input and normal images. It assumes the input texture to be homogeneous, detecting image regions that break the homogeneity as anomalies. We present a quantitative criterion to judge whether this assumption holds for an input texture. Experimental results show the broad applicability of the proposed zero-shot method and its good performance comparable to or even higher than the state-of-the-art methods using hundreds of normal samples.

Specifying the right space of admissible transformations is challenging: the registration quality can be poor if the space is too restrictive, while the optimization can be hard to solve if the space is too general. Recent learning-based methods, utilizing deep neural networks to learn the transformation directly, achieve fast inference, but face challenges in accuracy due to the difficulties in capturing the small local deformations and generalization ability. Here we propose a new optimization-based method named DNVF (Diffeomorphic Image Registration with Neural Velocity Field) which utilizes deep neural network to model the space of admissible transformations. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sinusoidal activation function is used to represent the continuous velocity field and assigns a velocity vector to every point in space, providing the flexibility of modeling complex deformations as well as the convenience of optimization. Moreover, we propose a cascaded image registration framework (Cas-DNVF) by combining the benefits of both optimization and learning based methods, where a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) is trained to predict the initial deformation, followed by DNVF for further refinement.

Unlike general images, these two labels are easily obtained in phase-contrast images. The intercellular boundary, which is necessary for cell instance segmentation, cannot be directly obtained from these two weak labels, so to generate the boundary information, we propose a single instance pasting based on the copy-and-paste technique. First, we locate single-cell regions by counting cells and store them in a pool. Then, we generate the intercellular boundary by pasting the stored single-cell regions to the original image. Finally, we train a boundary estimation network with the generated labels and perform instance segmentation with the network. Our evaluation on a public dataset demonstrated that the proposed method achieves the best performance among the several weakly supervised methods we compared",

    "abstract": "Considering the functionality of situational awareness in safety-critical automation systems, the perception of risk in driving scenes and its explainability is of particular importance for autonomous and cooperative driving. Toward this goal, this paper proposes a new research direction of joint risk localization in driving scenes and its risk explanation as a natural language description. Due to the lack of standard benchmarks, we collected a large-scale dataset, DRAMA (Driving Risk Assessment Mechanism with A captioning module), which consists of 17,785 interactive driving scenarios collected in Tokyo, Japan. Our DRAMA dataset accommodates video- and object-level questions on driving risks with associated important objects to achieve the goal of visual captioning as a free-form language description utilizing closed and open-ended responses for multi-level questions, which can be used to evaluate a range of visual captioning capabilities in driving scenarios. We make this data available to the community for further research. Using DRAMA, we explore multiple facets of joint risk localization and captioning in interactive driving scenarios. In particular, we benchmark various multi-task prediction architectures and provide a detailed analysis of joint risk localization and risk captioning.

In this work, we seek to substantially reduce the inputs to a single unposed image. Existing approaches using local image features to reconstruct a 3D object often render blurry predictions at viewpoints distant from the source view. To address this, we propose to leverage both the global and local features to form an expressive 3D representation. The global features are learned from a vision transformer, while the local features are extracted from a 2D convolutional network. To synthesize a novel view, we train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network conditioned on the learned 3D representation to perform volume rendering. This novel 3D representation allows the network to reconstruct unseen regions without enforcing constraints like symmetry or canonical coordinate systems. Our method renders novel views from just a single input image, and generalizes across multiple object categories using a single model.

In order to achieve a generic editing pipeline, we pose this as multi-attribute image manipulation task, where the attribute ranges from item category, fabric, pattern to collar and neckline. We empirically show that conventional methods fail in our challenging setting, and study efficient adaptation scheme that involves recently introduced attention-pooling technique to obtain a multi-attribute classifier guidance.

Many papers train one model for each scene respectively and few of them explore incorporating multi-modal data into this problem. In this paper, we focus on a rarely discussed but important setting: can we train one model that can represent multiple scenes, with 360deg insufficient views and RGB-D images? We refer insufficient views to few extremely sparse and almost non-overlapping views. To deal with it, X-NeRF, a fully explicit approach which learns a general scene completion process instead of a coordinate-based mapping, is proposed. Given a few insufficient RGB-D input views, X-NeRF first transforms them to a sparse point cloud tensor and then applies a 3D sparse generative Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to complete it to an explicit radiance field whose volumetric rendering can be conducted fast without running networks during inference. To avoid overfitting, besides common rendering loss, we apply perceptual loss as well as view augmentation through random rotation on point clouds.

However, DNNs are notoriously fragile to the class imbalance in image classification. We further point out that such imbalance fragility can be amplified when it comes to more sophisticated tasks such as pathology localization, as imbalances in such problems can have highly complex and often implicit forms of presence. For example, different pathology can have different sizes or colors (w.r.t.the background), different underlying demographic distributions, and in general different difficulty levels to recognize, even in a meticulously curated balanced distribution of training data. In this paper, we propose to use pruning to automatically and adaptively identify hard-to-learn (HTL) training samples, and improve pathology localization by attending them explicitly, during training in supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly-supervised settings. Our main inspiration is drawn from the recent finding that deep classification models have difficult-to-memorize samples and those may be effectively exposed through network pruning - and we extend such observation beyond classification for the first time. We also present interesting demographic analysis which illustrates HTLs ability to capture complex demographic imbalances. Our extensive experiments on the Skin Lesion Localization task in multiple training settings by paying additional attention to HTLs show significant improvement of localization performance by  2-3%",

In this paper, we propose a three-stage cascaded Scale-Augmented Transformer (SAT) person search framework. In the three-stage design of our SAT framework, the first stage performs person detection whereas the last two stages performs both detection and re-identification. Considering the contradictory nature of detection and identification, in the last two stages, we introduce separate norm feature embeddings for the two tasks to reconcile the relationship between them in a joint person search model. Our SAT framework benefits from the attributes of convolutional neural networks and transformers by introducing a convolutional encoder and a scale modulator within each stage. Here, the convolutional encoder increases the generalization ability of the model whereas the scale modulator performs context aggregation at different granularity levels to aid in handling pose/scale variations within a region of interest. To further improve the performance during occlusion, we apply shifting augmentation operations at each granularity level within the scale modulator.

Consequently, in the online setting, this results in disconnections of tracklets which cannot be recovered. In this regard, we present Sparse Graph Tracker (SGT), a novel online graph tracker using higher-order relational features which are more discriminative by aggregating the features of neighboring detections and their relations. SGT converts video data into a graph where detections, their connections, and the relational features of two connected nodes are represented by nodes, edges, and edge features, respectively.

    "title": "Image Completion With Heterogeneously Filtered Spectral Hints",
    "abstract": "Image completion with large-scale free-form missing regions is one of the most challenging tasks for the computer vision community. While researchers pursue better solutions, drawbacks such as pattern unawareness, blurry textures, and structure distortion remain noticeable, and thus leave space for improvement. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new StyleGAN-based image completion network, Spectral Hint GAN (SH-GAN), inside which a carefully designed spectral processing module, Spectral Hint Unit, is introduced. We also propose two novel 2D spectral processing strategies, Heterogeneous Filtering, and Gaussian Split that well-fit modern deep learning models and may further be extended to other tasks. From our inclusive experiments, we demonstrate that our model can reach FID scores of 3.4134 and 7.0277 on the benchmark datasets FFHQ and Places2, and therefore outperforms prior works and reaches a new state-of-the-art. We also prove the effectiveness of our design via ablation studies, from which one may notice that the aforementioned challenges, i.e. pattern unawareness, blurry textures, and structure distortion, can be noticeably resolved.

    "title": "Split To Learn: Gradient Split for Multi-Task Human Image Analysis",
    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to train a unified deep network that simultaneously solves multiple human-related tasks. A multi-task framework is favorable for sharing information across tasks under restricted computational resources. However, tasks not only share information but may also compete for resources and conflict with each other, making the optimization of shared parameters difficult and leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a simple but effective training scheme called GradSplit that alleviates this issue by utilizing asymmetric inter-task relations. Specifically, at each convolution module, it splits features into T groups for T tasks and trains each group only using the gradient back-propagated from the task losses with which it does not have conflicts. During training, we apply GradSplit to a series of convolution modules. As a result, each module is trained to generate a set of task-specific features using the shared features from the previous module. This enables a network to use complementary information across tasks while circumventing gradient conflicts. Experimental results show that GradSplit achieves a better accuracy-efficiency trade-off than existing methods. It minimizes accuracy drop caused by task conflicts while significantly saving compute resources in terms of both FLOPs and memory at inference. We further show that GradSplit achieves higher cross-dataset accuracy compared to single-task and other multi-task networks",

In this paper, we design TransPillars, a novel transformer-based feature aggregation technique that exploits temporal features of consecutive point cloud frames for multi-frame 3D object detection. TransPillars aggregates spatial-temporal point cloud features from two perspectives. First, it fuses voxel-level features directly from multi-frame feature maps instead of pooled instance features to preserve instance details with contextual information that are essential to accurate object localization. Second, it introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy to fuse multi-scale features progressively to effectively capture the motion of moving objects and guide the aggregation of fine features. Besides, a variant of deformable transformer is introduced to improve the effectiveness of cross-frame feature matching.

    "abstract": "Occluded person re-identification (ReID) is a person retrieval task which aims at matching occluded person images with holistic ones. For addressing occluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer fine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance), this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not adapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided with human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body part-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules for predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features of the ReID target. We then propose GiLt, a novel training scheme for learning part-based representations that is robust to occlusions and non-discriminative local appearance. Extensive experiments on popular holistic and occluded datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.7% mAP and 5.6% rank-1 accuracy on the challenging Occluded-Duke dataset.

To address the issue, this paper proposes a generative model of LiDAR range images applicable to the data-level domain transfer. Motivated by the fact that LiDAR measurement is based on point-by-point range imaging, we train an implicit image representation-based generative adversarial networks along with a differentiable ray-drop effect. We demonstrate the fidelity and diversity of our model in comparison with the point-based and image-based state-of-the-art generative models. We also showcase upsampling and restoration applications.

    "abstract": "Remote photoplethysmography can provide non-contact heart rate (HR) estimation by analyzing the skin color variations obtained from face videos. These variations are subtle, imperceptible to human eyes, and easily affected by noise. Existing deep learning-based rPPG estimators are incompetent due to three reasons. Firstly, they suppress the noise by utilizing information from the whole face even though different facial regions contain different noise characteristics. Secondly, local noise characteristics inherently affect the convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Lastly, the CNN sequential architectures fail to preserve long temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose RADIANT, that is, rPPG estimation using Signal Embeddings and Transformer. Our Transformer utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism that facilitates the feature subspace learning to extract the multiple correlations among the color variations corresponding to the periodic pulse. Also, its global information processing ability helps to suppress local noise characteristics. Apart from Transformer, we propose novel signal embedding to enhance the rPPG feature representation and suppress noise. We have also improved the generalization of our architecture by adding a new training set. To this end, the effectiveness of synthetic temporal signals and data augmentations were explored.

A cluttered office can contain a busy table; even though these compositions don't share a state or object, the presence of a busy table can guide the presence of a cluttered office. We propose a novel method called Compositional Attention Propagated Embedding (CAPE) as a solution. The key intuition to our method is that a rich dependency structure exists between compositions arising from complex interactions of primitives in addition to other dependencies between compositions. CAPE learns to identify this structure and propagates knowledge between them to learn class embedding for all seen and unseen compositions.

Considering intersections among bounding boxes in a scene would result in ambiguous labels, we first group points into two sets, i.e., univocal and equivocal sets, indicating the certainty of a 3D point belonging to an instance, respectively. Specifically, 3D points with clear labels belong to the univocal set while the rest are grouped into the equivocal set. To assign reliable labels to points in the equivocal set, we design a Geometry-guided Label Propagation (GLP) scheme that progressively propagates labels to linked points based on geometric structure, e.g., polygon meshes and superpoints. Afterwards, we train an instance segmentation model with the univocal points and equivocal points labeled by GLP, and then employ it to assign pseudo labels for the remainder of the unlabeled points. Lastly, we retrain the model with all the labeled points to achieve better instance segmentation performance.

Recently, federated learning (FL), an emerging machine learning paradigm to train a global model from multiple decentralized clients without compromising data privacy, brings new challenges, also new possibilities, to DG. In the FL scenario, many existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) DG methods become ineffective, because they require the centralization of data from different domains during training. In this paper, we propose a novel domain generalization method for image recognition under federated learning through cross-client style transfer (CCST) without exchanging data samples. Our CCST method can lead to more uniform distributions of source clients, and thus make each local model learn to fit the image styles of all the clients to avoid the different model biases. Two types of style (single image style and overall domain style) with corresponding mechanisms are proposed to be chosen according to different scenarios. Our style representation is exceptionally lightweight and can hardly be used for the reconstruction of the dataset. The level of diversity is also flexible to be controlled with a hyper-parameter. Our method outperforms recent SOTA DG methods on two DG benchmarks (PACS, OfficeHome) and a large-scale medical image dataset (Camelyon17) in the FL setting.

To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map.

To increase its real world applicability, numerous models have also been proposed to restore SR images with arbitrary scale factors, including asymmetric ones where images are resized to different scales along horizontal and vertical directions. Though most models are only optimized for the unidirectional upscaling task while assuming a predefined downscaling kernel for low-resolution (LR) inputs, recent models based on Invertible Neural Networks (INN) are able to increase upscaling accuracy significantly by optimizing the downscaling and upscaling cycle jointly. However, limited by the INN architecture, it is constrained to fixed integer scale factors and requires one model for each scale. Without increasing model complexity, a simple and effective invertible arbitrary rescaling network (IARN) is proposed to achieve arbitrary image rescaling by training only one model in this work. Using innovative components like position-aware scale encoding and preemptive channel splitting, the network is optimized to convert the non-invertible rescaling cycle to an effectively invertible process. It is shown to achieve a state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in bidirectional arbitrary rescaling without compromising perceptual quality in LR outputs. It is also demonstrated to perform well on tests with asymmetric scales using the same network architecture",

In IFSR, we leverage the intermediate features in an identity encoder to preserve important attributes such as head pose, facial expression, lighting, and occlusion in the target face, while still transferring the identity of the source face with high fidelity.

    "abstract": "Recently, due to the increasing requirements of medical imaging applications and the professional requirements of annotating medical images, few-shot learning has gained increasing attention in the medical image semantic segmentation field. To perform segmentation with limited number of labeled medical images, most existing studies use Prototypical Networks (PN) and have obtained compelling success. However, these approaches overlook the query image features extracted from the proposed representation network, failing to preserving the spatial connection between query and support images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised few-shot medical image segmentation network and introduce a novel Cycle-Resemblance Attention (CRA) module to fully leverage the pixel-wise relation between query and support medical images. Notably, we first line up multiple attention blocks to refine more abundant relation information. Then, we present CRAPNet by integrating the CRA module with a classic prototype network, where pixel-wise relations between query and support features are well recaptured for segmentation.

While training deep models on the small set of condensed images can be extremely fast, their synthesis remains computationally expensive due to the complex bi-level optimization and second-order derivative computation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method that synthesizes condensed images by matching feature distributions of the synthetic and original training images in many sampled embedding spaces. Our method significantly reduces the synthesis cost while achieving comparable or better performance.

To develop the certified defense for CBIR, we first define new certified robustness of CBIR, which guarantees that no AX that changes the ranking of CBIR exists around the query or candidate images. Then, we propose computationally tractable verification algorithms that verify whether the certified robustness of CBIR is achieved by utilizing upper and lower bounds of distances between feature representations of perturbed and non-perturbed images.

    "abstract": "Due to the scarcity of dense pixel-level semantic annotations for images recorded in adverse visual conditions, there has been a keen interest in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for the semantic segmentation of such images. UDA adapts models trained on normal conditions to the target adverse-condition domains. Meanwhile, multiple datasets with driving scenes provide corresponding images of the same scenes across multiple conditions, which can serve as a form of weak supervision for domain adaptation. We propose Refign, a generic extension to self-training-based UDA methods which leverages these cross-domain correspondences. Refign consists of two steps: (1) aligning the normal-condition image to the corresponding adverse-condition image using an uncertainty-aware dense matching network, and (2) refining the adverse prediction with the normal prediction using an adaptive label correction mechanism. We design custom modules to streamline both steps and set the new state of the art for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on several adverse-condition benchmarks, including ACDC and Dark Zurich. The approach introduces no extra training parameters, minimal computational overhead--during training only--and can be used as a drop-in extension to improve any given self-training-based UDA method.

To achieve a good trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we propose an Efficient Transformer for Re-ranking (ETR), utilizing both global and local descriptors to re-rank the top candidates in a single shot. In contrast to traditional re-ranking methods, we leverage self-attention to capture relationships between local descriptors in a single image and cross-attention to explore the similarity of the image pairs.

    "title": "MT-DETR: Robust End-to-End Multimodal Detection With Confidence Fusion",
    "abstract": "Due to the trending need for autonomous driving, camera-based object detection has recently attracted lots of attention and successful development. However, there are times when unexpected and severe weather occurs in outdoor environments, making the detection tasks less effective and unexpected. In this case, additional sensors like lidar and radar are adopted to help the camera work in bad weather. However, existing multimodal detection methods do not consider the characteristics of different vehicle sensors to complement each other. Therefore, a novel end-to-end multimodal multistage object detection network called MT-DETR is proposed. Unlike the unimodal object detection networks, MT-DETR adds fusion modules and enhancement modules and adopts a hierarchical fusion mechanism. The Residual Fusion Module (RFM) and Confidence Fusion Module (CFM) are designed to fuse camera, lidar, radar, and time features. The Residual Enhancement Module (REM) reinforces each unimodal branch while a multistage loss is introduced to strengthen each branch's effectiveness. The synthesis algorithm for generating camera-lidar data pairs in foggy conditions further boosts the performance in unseen adverse weather. Extensive experiments on various weather conditions of the STF dataset demonstrate that MT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The generality of MT-DETR has also been confirmed by replacing the feature extractor in the experiments. The code and pre-trained models are available on https://github.com/Chushihyun/MT-DETR",

Thus, ADA creates a continuum of cost-performance trade-off models, with unsupervised, and fully supervised DA techniques at the two ends. We observe that in ADA not all regions of a selected frame contribute equally to a model's performance, and there is a strong correlation between annotating certain hard/unique/novel object/stuff instances, and a model's performance. E.g., road regions in a target dataset may look mostly similar to source domain except for certain curved instances, where annotation may be more useful. Based on the observation, we propose Anchor-based and Augmentation-based ADA techniques, which, given a selected frame, determine certain 'hard' semantic regions to be annotated in that frame, such that the selected regions are complementary and diverse in the context of the current labeled set. The proposed techniques carefully avoid the pitfall of region based AL techniques which try to choose most uncertain regions in a frame, but ends up selecting all edge pixels, and similar annotation cost as the whole frame.

Its goal is to semantically manipulate parts of an input reference image according to the text descriptions. However, most of the existing works have the following problems: (1) text-irrelevant content cannot always be maintained but randomly changed, (2) the performance of image manipulation still needs to be further improved, (3) only can manipulate descriptive attributes. To solve these problems, we propose a novel image manipulation method that interactively edits an image using complex text instructions. It allows users to not only improve the accuracy of image manipulation but also achieve complex tasks such as enlarging, dwindling, or removing objects and replacing the background with the input image. To make these tasks possible, we apply three strategies. First, the given image is divided into text-relevant content and text-irrelevant content. Only the text-relevant content is manipulated and the text-irrelevant content can be maintained. Second, a super-resolution method is used to enlarge the manipulation region to further improve the operability and to help manipulate the object itself. Third, a user interface is introduced for editing the segmentation map interactively to re-modify the generated image according to the user's desires. Extensive experiments on the Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB) dataset and Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) datasets demonstrate our proposed method can enable interactive, flexible, and accurate image manipulation in real-time.

First, limited high-dimensional HSI training examples exacerbate the difficulty of deep learning methods in learning effective spatial and spectral representations. Second, the existing CNN-based methods model local relations and present limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. In this paper, we customize a novel dual-stream Transformer (DSTrans) for HSI restoration, which mainly consists of the dual-stream attention and the dual-stream feed-forward network. Specifically, we develop the dual-stream attention consisting of Multi-Dconv-head spectral attention (MDSA) and Multi-head Spatial self-attention (MSSA). MDSA and MSSA respectively calculate self-attention along the spectral and spatial dimensions in local windows to capture long-range spectrum dependencies and model global spatial interactions. Meanwhile, the dual-stream feed-forward network is developed to extract global signals and local details in parallel branches. In addition, we exploit a multi-tasking network to train the auxiliary RGB image (RGBI) task and HSI task jointly so that both numerous RGBI samples and limited HSI samples are exploited to learn parameter distribution for DSTrans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on HSI restoration tasks, including HSI super-resolution and denoising.

This paper introduces a novel method we call Cascaded Pose Refinement Transformers, or CRT-6D. We replace the commonly used dense intermediate representation with a sparse set of features sampled from the feature pyramid we call OSKFs(Object Surface Keypoint Features) where each element corresponds to an object keypoint. We employ lightweight deformable transformers and chain them together to iteratively refine proposed poses over the sampled OSKFs. We achieve inference runtimes 2x faster than the closest real-time state of the art methods while supporting up to 21 objects on a single model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRT-6D by performing extensive experiments on the LM-O and YCBV datasets. Compared to real-time methods, we achieve state of the art on LM-O and YCB-V, falling slightly behind methods with inference runtimes one order of magnitude higher.

    "abstract": "The cost volume, capturing the similarity of possible correspondences across two input images, is a key ingredient in state-of-the-art optical flow approaches. When sampling correspondences to build the cost volume, a large neighborhood radius is required to deal with large displacements, introducing a significant computational burden. To address this, coarse-to-fine or recurrent processing of the cost volume is usually adopted, where correspondence sampling in a local neighborhood with a small radius suffices. In this paper, we propose an alternative by constructing cost volumes with different dilation factors to capture small and large displacements simultaneously. A U-Net with sikp connections is employed to convert the dilated cost volumes into interpolation weights between all possible captured displacements to get the optical flow. Our proposed model DCVNet only needs to process the cost volume once in a simple feedforward manner and does not rely on the sequential processing strategy. DCVNet obtains comparable accuracy to existing approaches and achieves real-time inference (30 fps on a mid-end 1080ti GPU)",

    "abstract": "Modern deep generative models can assign high likelihood to inputs drawn from outside the training distribution, posing threats to models in open-world deployments. While much research attention has been placed on defining new test-time measures of OOD uncertainty, these methods do not fundamentally change how deep generative models are regularized and optimized in training. In particular, generative models are shown to overly rely on the background information to estimate the likelihood. To address the issue, we propose a novel frequency-regularized learning (FRL) framework for OOD detection, which incorporates high-frequency information into training and guides the model to focus on semantically relevant features. FRL effectively improves performance on a wide range of generative architectures, including variational auto-encoder, GLOW, and PixelCNN++. On a new large-scale evaluation task, FRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming a strong baseline Likelihood Regret by 10.7% (AUROC) while achieving 147x faster inference speed. Extensive ablations show that FRL improves the OOD detection performance while preserving the image generation quality",

    "title": "Similarity Contrastive Estimation for Self-Supervised Soft Contrastive Learning",
    "abstract": "Contrastive representation learning has proven to be an effective self-supervised learning method. Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations, or semantic similarity, between the instances. Contrastive learning implicitly learns relations but considering all negatives as noise harms the quality of the learned relations. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive learning one. Instead of hard classifying positives and negatives, we estimate from one view of a batch a continuous distribution to push or pull instances based on their semantic similarities. This target similarity distribution is sharpened to eliminate noisy relations. The model predicts for each instance, from another view, the target distribution while contrasting its positive with negatives. Experimental results show that SCE is Top-1 on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol at 100 pretraining epochs with 72.1% accuracy and is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms by reaching 75.4% for 200 epochs with multi-crop. We also show that SCE is able to generalize to several tasks. Source code is available here: https://github.com/CEA-LIST/SCE",

Based on this finding, we present a novel class-level confidence based 3D SSL method. Firstly, a dynamic thresholding strategy is proposed to utilize more unlabeled data, especially for low learning status classes. Then, a re-sampling strategy is designed to avoid biasing toward high learning status classes, which dynamically changes the sampling probability of each class. Unlike the latest state-of-the-art SSL method FlexMatch which also utilizes dynamic threshold, our method can be applied to the inherently imbalanced dataset and thus is more general. To show the effectiveness of our method in 3D SSL tasks, we conduct extensive experiments on 3D SSL classification and detection tasks.

In this work, we establish PIDS, a novel paradigm to jointly explore point interactions and point dimensions to serve semantic segmentation on point cloud data. We establish a large search space to jointly consider versatile point interactions and point dimensions. This supports point operators with various geometry/density considerations. The enlarged search space with heterogeneous search components calls for a better ranking of candidate models. To achieve this, we improve the search space exploration by leveraging predictor-based Neural Architecture Search (NAS), and enhance the quality of prediction by assigning unique encoding to heterogeneous search components based on their priors.

We evaluate the performance of cooperative perception for both vehicle and pedestrian detection using the CODD dataset.

This dataset is created using cross-calibrated mmWave radar sensors and a monocular RGB camera for cross-modality training of radar-based human pose estimation. There are two advantages of using mmWave radar to perform human pose estimation. First, it is robust to dark and low-light conditions. Second, it is not visually perceivable by humans and therefore, can be widely applied to applications with privacy concerns, e.g., surveillance systems in patient rooms. In addition to the benchmark, we propose a cross-modality training framework that leverages the ground-truth 2D keypoints representing human body joints for training, which are systematically generated from the pre-trained 2D pose estimation network based on a monocular camera input image, avoiding laborious manual label annotation efforts. The framework consists of a new radar pre-processing method that better extracts the velocity information from radar data, Cross- and Self-Attention Module (CSAM), to fuse multi-scale radar features, and Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Networks (PRGCN), to refine the predicted keypoint confidence heatmaps. Our intensive experiments on the HuPR benchmark show that the proposed scheme achieves better human pose estimation performance with only radar data, as compared to traditional pre-processing solutions and previous radio-frequency-based methods.

Previous works in deep MVS select a range of interest within the depth space, discretize it, and sample the epipolar line according to the resulting depth values: this can result in an uneven scanning of the epipolar line, hence of the image space. Instead, our method works directly on the epipolar line: this guarantees an even scanning of the image space and avoids both the need to select a depth range of interest, which is often not known a priori and can vary dramatically from scene to scene, and the need for a suitable discretization of the depth space. In fact, our search is iterative, which avoids the building of a cost volume, costly both to store and to process. Finally, our method performs a robust geometry-aware fusion of the estimated depth maps, leveraging a confidence predicted alongside each depth.

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art for monocular 3D human pose estimation in videos is dominated by the paradigm of 2D-to-3D pose uplifting. While the uplifting methods themselves are rather efficient, the true computational complexity depends on the per-frame 2D pose estimation. In this paper, we present a Transformer-based pose uplifting scheme that can operate on temporally sparse 2D pose sequences but still produce temporally dense 3D pose estimates. We show how masked token modeling can be utilized for temporal upsampling within Transformer blocks. This allows to decouple the sampling rate of input 2D poses and the target frame rate of the video and drastically decreases the total computational complexity. Additionally, we explore the option of pre-training on large motion capture archives, which has been largely neglected so far.

While most of the existing neural video coding literature addresses first-order redundancy, we tackle the problem of capturing second-order redundancy in neural video codecs via predictors. We introduce generic motion and residual predictors that learn to extrapolate from previously decoded data. These predictors are lightweight, and can be employed with most neural video codecs in order to improve their rate-distortion performance. Moreover, while RGB is the dominant colorspace in neural video coding literature, we introduce general modifications for neural video codecs to embrace the YUV420 colorspace and report YUV420 results.

Similarly, some methods focus on a particular fabric, body shape, and pose. To circumvent these limitations, our method fundamentally learns the physical dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body shape, motion, and fabric properties to generalize across garment types, topology, and fabric along with different body shape and pose. In particular, we represent the garment as a graph, where the nodes represent the physical state of the garment vertices, and the edges represent the relation between the two nodes. The nodes and edges of the garment graph encode various properties of garments and the human body to compute the dynamics of the vertices through a learned message-passing. Learning of such dynamics of the garment vertices conditioned on underlying body motion and fabric properties enables our method to be trained simultaneously for multiple types of garments (e.g., tops, skirts, etc) with arbitrary mesh resolutions, varying topologies, and fabric properties.

    "title": "Aggregating Bilateral Attention for Few-Shot Instance Localization",
    "abstract": "Attention filtering under various learning scenarios has proven advantageous in enhancing the performance of many neural network architectures. The mainstream attention mechanism is established upon the non-local block, also known as an essential component of the prominent Transformer networks, to catch long-range correlations. However, such unilateral attention is often hampered by sparse and obscure responses, revealing insufficient dependencies across images/patches, and high computational cost, especially for those employing the multi-head design. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel mechanism of aggregating bilateral attention (ABA) and validate its usefulness in tackling the task of few-shot instance localization, reflecting the underlying query-support dependency. Specifically, our method facilitates uncovering informative features via assessing: i) an embedding norm for exploring the semantically-related cues; ii) context awareness for correlating the query data and support regions. ABA is then carried out by integrating the affinity relations derived from the two measurements to serve as a lightweight but effective query-support attention mechanism with high localization recall. We evaluate ABA on two localization tasks, namely, few-shot action localization and one-shot object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed ABA achieves superior performances over existing methods",

    "abstract": "Plant diseases severely limits agriculture production, necessitating the high-throughput monitoring of plant leaves. Currently, this is formulated as an automatic disease segmentation task addressed via deep learning frameworks. These deep leaning frameworks trained with leaf image data in a supervised paradigm have few limitations, mainly: (1) training datasets are heavily imbalanced towards healthy leaf images, (2) disease region annotation is labour-intensive and (3) due to the heterogeneity of disease symptoms, these frameworks lacks generalisability. In this paper, we reformulate disease segmentation as an anomaly localisation task. Specifically, we introduce a novel unsupervised framework (AnoLeaf) based on an edge-guided inpainting that optimises the learning of contextual attention on only healthy leaf images. The network utilisation on diseased leaf images results in reconstruction of its healthy counterparts, generating an inpainting error. The contextual attention maps reinforce the inpainting error to effectively localise the disease. Thus, AnoLeaf alleviates the acquisition and annotation of rare disease images. Additional experiments on MVTec anomaly detection dataset further demonstrate its generalisability",

    "abstract": "Crowd counting has attracted increasing attentions in recent years due to its challenges and wide societal applications. Despite persevering efforts made by the research community, most of existing methods require a large amount of location-level annotations. Collecting such type of fine-granularity supervisory signals is extremely time-consuming and labour-intensive, thereby hindering the well generalization of these location-adherent models. To shun this drawback, several pioneering studies open a promising research direction of location-agonistic crowd counting. Albeit the noticeable efforts, they somewhat ignore the merits of diverse learning paradigms and the issue of intractable density shift. To ameliorate these issues, in this paper, a novel Dynamic Mixture of Counter Network (DMCNet) is proposed for location-agnostic crowd counting. Specifically, our DMCNet inherits the hybrid advantages of CNNs (e.g. locality-oriented and pyramidal property) and MLP-based structure (e.g. global receptive fields and light weight). Particularly, the dynamic counter predictor and the mixture of counter heads are delicately designed to hammer at combating huge density shift and overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMCNet attains state-of-the-art performance against existing location-agnostic approaches and performs on par with many conventional location-adherent ones",

SECLA is a Symmetry-Enhanced Contrastive Learning-based Alignment model that can effectively maximize the similarity scores between corresponding faces and names in a weakly supervised fashion. A variation of the model, SECLA-B, learns to align names and faces as humans do, that is, learning from easy to hard cases to further increase the performance of SECLA. More specifically, SECLA-B applies a two-stage learning framework: (1) Training the model on an easy subset with a few names and faces in each image-caption pair. (2) Leveraging the known pairs of names and faces from the easy cases using a bootstrapping strategy with additional loss to prevent forgetting and learning new alignments at the same time.

    "abstract": "Discriminativeness is a desirable feature of image captions: captions should describe the characteristic details of input images. However, recent high-performing captioning models, which are trained with reinforcement learning (RL), tend to generate overly generic captions despite their high performance in various other criteria. First, we investigate the cause of the unexpectedly low discriminativeness and show that RL has a deeply rooted side effect of limiting the output words to high-frequency words. The limited vocabulary is a severe bottleneck for discriminativeness as it is difficult for a model to describe the details beyond its vocabulary. This identification of the bottleneck allows us to drastically recast discriminative image captioning as a much simpler task of encouraging low-frequency word generation. Hinted by long-tail classification and debiasing methods, we propose the methods that easily switch off-the-shelf RL models to discriminativeness-aware models with only a single-epoch fine-tuning on the part of the parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance the discriminativeness of off-the-shelf RL models and even outperform previous discriminativeness-aware methods with much smaller computational costs.

Some prior results were obtained utilizing the techniques of adding extra parameters to extend the limits of the certification regions. In this way, sample-wise optimization was proposed to maximize the certification radius per input. The idea was further extended with the generalized anisotropic counterparts of l1 and l2 certificates which allow achieving larger certified region volume avoiding worst-case certification near potentially larger safe regions. However, anisotropic certification is limited by the aligned axis lacking the freedom to extend in any direction. To mitigate this constraint, in this work, we (i) revisit the anisotropic certification, provide an analysis of its non-axis aligned counterpart and propose its rotation-free extension, (ii) conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to report the improved performance",

    "abstract": "Many real-world scenarios in which DNN-based recognition systems are deployed have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition, medical image classification). In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities, and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in fine-grained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/zjysteven/MixOE",

Although it is an effective approach, the adaptive approach requires many iterations involving the inference process to assess the candidate data, which is not suitable for LiDAR systems.

Thus, we study the problem of semi-supervised learning for low-light image restoration when limited low-light images have ground truth labels. Our main contributions in this work are twofold. We first deploy an ensemble of low-light restoration networks to restore the unlabeled images and generate a set of potential pseudo-labels. We model the contrast distortions in the labeled set to generate different sets of training data and create the ensemble of networks. We then design a contrastive self-supervised learning based image quality measure to obtain the pseudo-label among the images restored by the ensemble. We show that training the restoration network with the pseudo-labels allows us to achieve excellent restoration performance even with very few labeled pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on three popular low-light image restoration datasets to show the superior performance of our semi-supervised low-light image restoration compared to other approaches",

    "title": "Select, Label, and Mix: Learning Discriminative Invariant Feature Representations for Partial Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Partial domain adaptation which assumes that the unknown target label space is a subset of the source label space has attracted much attention in computer vision. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from three key problems: negative transfer, lack of discriminability, and domain invariance in the latent space. To alleviate the above issues, we develop a novel 'Select, Label, and Mix' (SLM) framework that aims to learn discriminative invariant feature representations for partial domain adaptation. First, we present an efficient \"select\" module that automatically filters out the outlier source samples to avoid negative transfer while aligning distributions across both domains. Second, the \"label\" module iteratively trains the classifier using both the labeled source domain data and the generated pseudo-labels for the target domain to enhance the discriminability of the latent space. Finally, the \"mix\" module utilizes domain mixup regularization jointly with the other two modules to explore more intrinsic structures across domains leading to a domain-invariant latent space for partial domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over state-of-the-art methods. Project page: https://cvir.github.io/projects/slm",

In this work we propose a training algorithm, which allows to supervise Optical Flow (OF) networks directly on the reconstructed depth, without the need of having ground truth flows.

Graph Convolutional networks (GCNs) allow for the preservation of the topologies of hands poses and shapes by modeling them as a graph. In this work, we propose the THOR-Net which combines the power of GCNs, Transformer, and self-supervision to realistically reconstruct two hands and an object from a single RGB image. Our network comprises two stages; namely the features extraction stage and the reconstruction stage. In the features extraction stage, a Keypoint RCNN is used to extract 2D poses, features maps, heatmaps, and bounding boxes from a monocular RGB image. Thereafter, this 2D information is modeled as two graphs and passed to the two branches of the reconstruction stage. The shape reconstruction branch estimates meshes of two hands and an object using our novel coarse-to-fine GraFormer shape network. The 3D poses of the hands and objects are reconstructed by the other branch using a GraFormer network. Finally, a self-supervised photometric loss is used to directly regress the realistic textured of each vertex in the hands' meshes. Our approach achieves State-of-the-art results in Hand shape estimation on the HO3D dataset (10.0mm) exceeding ArtiBoost (10.8mm). It also surpasses other methods in hand pose estimation on the challenging two hands and object (H2O) dataset by 5mm on the left-hand pose and 1 mm on the right-hand pose.

Therefore, we propose an intra-source style augmentation (ISSA) method to improve domain generalization in semantic segmentation. Our method is based on a novel masked noise encoder for StyleGAN2 inversion. The model learns to faithfully reconstruct the image preserving its semantic layout through noise prediction. Random masking of the estimated noise enables the style mixing capability of our model, i.e. it allows to alter the global appearance without affecting the semantic layout of an image. Using the proposed masked noise encoder to randomize style and content combinations in the training set, ISSA effectively increases the diversity of training data and reduces spurious correlation. As a result, we achieve up to 12.4% mIoU improvements on driving-scene semantic segmentation under different types of data shifts, i.e., changing geographic locations, adverse weather conditions, and day to night. ISSA is model-agnostic and straightforwardly applicable with CNNs and Transformers.

    "title": "Expert-Defined Keywords Improve Interpretability of Retinal Image Captioning",
    "abstract": "Automatic machine learning-based (ML-based) medical report generation systems for retinal images suffer from a relative lack of interpretability. Hence, such ML-based systems are still not widely accepted. The main reason is that trust is one of the important motivating aspects of interpretability and humans do not trust blindly. Precise technical definitions of interpretability still lack consensus. Hence, it is difficult to make a human-comprehensible ML-based medical report generation system. Heat maps/saliency maps, i.e., post-hoc explanation approaches, are widely used to improve the interpretability of ML-based medical systems. However, they are well known to be problematic. From an ML-based medical model's perspective, the highlighted areas of an image are considered important for making a prediction. However, from a doctor's perspective, even the hottest regions of a heat map contain both useful and non-useful information. Simply localizing the region, therefore, does not reveal exactly what it was in that area that the model considered useful. Hence, the post-hoc explanation-based method relies on humans who probably have a biased nature to decide what a given heat map might mean. Interpretability boosters, in particular expert-defined keywords, are effective carriers of expert domain knowledge and they are human-comprehensible. In this work, we propose to exploit such keywords and a specialized attention-based strategy to build a more human-comprehensible medical report generation system for retinal images. Both keywords and the proposed strategy effectively improve the interpretability. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance under commonly used text evaluation metrics BLEU, ROUGE, CIDEr, and METEOR.

To address this issue, we propose a method, Meta-learning-based Open-set Recognition via Generative Adversarial Network (MORGAN), that can learn a finer separation between the closed and the open spaces. MORGAN seeks to generate class-conditioned adversarial samples for both the closed and open spaces in the few-shot regime using two GANs by judiciously tuning noise variance while ensuring discriminability using a novel Anti-Overlap Latent (AOL) regularizer. Adversarial samples from low noise variance amplify known class data density, and we use samples from high noise variance to augment known-unknowns. A first-order episodic strategy is adapted to ensure stability in the GAN training. Finally, we introduce a combination of metric losses which push these augmented known-unknowns or outliers to disperse in the open space while condensing known class distributions.

Our indirect adversarial losses use a simple known distribution (i.e., the Normal or Uniform distribution in our experiments) to simulate indirect adversarial learning between three parts -- real, fake, and intermediate distributions. Furthermore, we found the Kernelized Stein Discrepancy (KSD) from the IPM family as the adversarial loss function to avoid randomness from intermediate distribution samples because the target side (intermediate one) is sample-free in KSD.

However, while the self-attention models fail to incorporate the global context due to the limited size of the receptive fields, cross-attention learning may generate ambiguous features as the feature extractors for all the modalities are jointly trained. This results in the generation of redundant multi-modal features, thus limiting the fusion performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel fusion architecture called Global Attention based Fusion Network (GAF-Net), equipped with novel self and cross-attention learning techniques. We introduce the within-modality feature refinement module through global spectral-spatial attention learning using the query-key-value processing where both the global spatial and channel contexts are used to generate two channel attention masks. Since it is non-trivial to generate the cross-attention from within the fusion network, we propose to leverage two auxiliary tasks of modality-specific classification to produce highly discriminative cross-attention masks. Finally, to ensure non-redundancy, we propose to penalize the high correlation between attended modality-specific features.

When the detector succeeds, it can detect faces that cannot be recognized, no matter how capable the recognition system is. Recognizability, a latent variable, should therefore be factored into the design and implementation of face recognition systems. We propose a measure of recognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: An embedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using mostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby unrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the phenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, be it optical or motion blur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, or poor illumination. Therefore, we use the distance from such an \"unrecognizable identity\" as a measure of recognizability, and incorporate it into the design of the overall system. We show that accounting for recognizability reduces the error rate of single-image face recognition by 58% at FAR=1e-5 on the IJB-C Covariate Verification benchmark, and reduces the verification error rate by 24% at FAR=1e-5 in set-based recognition on the IJB-C benchmark",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer the knowledge learnt from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature. To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the performance of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly, ViT demonstrates superior generalization ability, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g., attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods",

    "abstract": "A match cut is a transition between a pair of shots that uses similar framing, composition, or action to fluidly bring the viewer from one scene to the next. Match cuts are frequently used in film, television, and advertising. However, finding shots that work together is a highly manual and time-consuming process that can take days. We propose a modular and flexible system to efficiently find high-quality match cut candidates starting from millions of shot pairs. We annotate and release a dataset of approximately 20,000 labeled pairs that we use to evaluate our system, using both classification and metric learning approaches that leverage a variety of image, video, audio, and audio-visual feature extractors. In addition, we release code and embeddings for reproducing our experiments at github.com/netflix/matchcut",

    "title": "Are Straight-Through Gradients and Soft-Thresholding All You Need for Sparse Training?",
    "abstract": "Turning the weights to zero when training a neural network helps in reducing the computational complexity at inference. To progressively increase the sparsity ratio in the network without causing sharp weight discontinuities during training, our work combines soft-thresholding and straight-through gradient estimation to update the raw, i.e. non-thresholded, version of zeroed weights. Our method, named ST-3 for straight-through/soft-thresholding/sparse-training, obtains SoA results, both in terms of accuracy/sparsity and accuracy/FLOPS trade-offs, when progressively increasing the sparsity ratio in a single training cycle. In particular, despite its simplicity, ST-3 favorably compares to the most recent methods, adopting differentiable formulations or bio-inspired neuroregeneration principles. This suggests that the key ingredients for effective sparsification primarily lie in the ability to give the weights the freedom to evolve smoothly across the zero state while progressively increasing the sparsity ratio.

    "title": "Fast and Accurate: Video Enhancement Using Sparse Depth",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a general framework to build fast and accurate algorithms for video enhancement tasks such as super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising. Essential to our framework is the realization that the accuracy, rather than the density, of pixel flows is what is required for high-quality video enhancement. Most of prior works take the opposite approach: they estimate dense (per-pixel)--but generally less robust--flows, mostly using computationally costly algorithms. Instead, we propose a lightweight flow estimation algorithm; it fuses the sparse point cloud data and (even sparser and less reliable) IMU data available in modern autonomous agents to estimate the flow information. Building on top of the flow estimation, we demonstrate a general framework that integrates the flows in a plug-and-play fashion with different task-specific layers. Algorithms built in our framework achieve 1.78x -- 187.41x speedup while providing a 0.42dB - 6.70 dB quality improvement over competing methods",

    "title": "SGPCR: Spherical Gaussian Point Cloud Representation and Its Application To Object Registration and Retrieval",
    "abstract": "Retrieving and aligning CAD models from databases with scanned real-world point clouds remains an important topic for 3D reconstruction. Due to zero point-to-point correspondences between the sampled CAD model and the scanned real-world object, an information-rich representation of point clouds is needed. We propose SGPCR, a novel method for representing 3D point clouds by Spherical Gaussians for efficient, stable, and rotation-equivariant representation. We also propose a rotation-invariant convolution to improve the representation quality through a trainable optimization process. In addition, we demonstrate the strengths of SGPCR-based point cloud representation using the fundamental challenge of shape retrieval and point cloud registration on point clouds with zero point-to-point correspondences. Under these conditions, our approach improves registration quality by reducing chamfer distance by up to 90% and rotation root mean square error by up to 86% compared to the state of the art. Furthermore, the proposed SGCPR is used for one-shot shape retrieval and registration and improves retrieval precision by up to 58% over comparable methods",

    "title": "Nested Deformable Multi-Head Attention for Facial Image Inpainting",
    "abstract": "Extracting adequate contextual information is an important aspect of any image inpainting method. To achieve this, ample image inpainting methods are available that aim to focus on large receptive fields. Recent advancements in the deep learning field with the introduction of transformers for image inpainting paved the way toward plausible results. Stacking multiple transformer blocks in a single layer causes the architecture to become computationally complex. In this context, we propose a novel lightweight architecture with a nested deformable attention based transformer layer for feature fusion. The nested attention helps the network to focus on long-term dependencies from encoder and decoder features. Also, multi head attention consisting of a deformable convolution is proposed to delve into the diverse receptive fields. With the advantage of nested and deformable attention, we propose a lightweight architecture for facial image inpainting. The results comparison on Celeb HQ [25] dataset using known (NVIDIA) and unknown (QD-IMD) masks and Places2 [57] dataset with NVIDIA masks along with extensive ablation study prove the superiority of the proposed approach for image inpainting tasks.

    "title": "Fashion Image Retrieval With Text Feedback by Additive Attention Compositional Learning",
    "abstract": "Effective fashion image retrieval with text feedback stands to impact a range of real-world applications, such as e-commerce. Given a source image and text feedback that describes the desired modifications to that image, the goal is to retrieve the target images that resemble the source yet satisfy the given modifications by composing a multi-modal (image-text) query. We propose a novel solution to this problem, Additive Attention Compositional Learning (AACL), that uses a multi-modal transformer-based architecture and effectively models the image-text contexts. Specifically, we propose a novel image-text composition module based on additive attention that can be seamlessly plugged into deep neural networks. We also introduce a new challenging benchmark derived from the Shopping100k dataset. AACL is evaluated on three large-scale datasets (FashionIQ, Fashion200k, and Shopping100k), each with strong baselines. Extensive experiments show that AACL achieves new state-of-the-art results on all three datasets",

    "title": "Center-Aware Adversarial Augmentation for Single Domain Generalization",
    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model from multiple training (i.e., source) domains that can generalize well to the unseen test (i.e., target) data coming from a different distribution. Single domain generalization (Single-DG) has recently emerged to tackle a more challenging, yet realistic setting, where only one source domain is available at training time. The existing Single-DG approaches typically are based on data augmentation strategies and aim to expand the span of source data by augmenting out-of-domain samples. Generally speaking, they aim to generate hard examples to confuse the classifier. While this may make the classifier robust to small perturbation, the generated samples are typically not diverse enough to mimic a large domain shift, resulting in sub-optimal generalization performance To alleviate this, we propose a center-aware adversarial augmentation technique that expands the source distribution by altering the source samples so as to push them away from the class centers via a novel angular center loss. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets for Single-DG and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in most cases",
