    "title": "Proportionally Fair Online Allocation of Public Goods with Predictions",
    "abstract": "We design online algorithms for fair allocation of public goods to a set of N agents over a sequence of T rounds and focus on improving their performance using predictions. In the basic model, a public good arrives in each round, and every agent reveals their value for it upon arrival. The algorithm must irrevocably decide the investment in this good without exceeding a total budget of B across all rounds. The algorithm can utilize (potentially noisy) predictions of each agent’s total value for all remaining goods. The algorithm's performance is measured using a proportional fairness objective, which informally demands that every group of agents be rewarded proportional to its size and the cohesiveness of its preferences. We show that no algorithm can achieve better than Θ(T/B) proportional fairness without predictions. With reasonably accurate predictions, the situation improves significantly, and Θ(log(T/B)) proportional fairness is achieved. We also extend our results to a general setting wherein a batch of L public goods arrive in each round and O(log(min(N,L)T/B)) proportional fairness is achieved. Our exact bounds are parameterized as a function of the prediction error, with performance degrading gracefully with increasing errors",

    "title": "On the Role of Memory in Robust Opinion Dynamics",
    "abstract": "We investigate opinion dynamics in a fully-connected system, consisting of n agents, where one of the opinions, called correct, represents a piece of information to disseminate. \r\nOne source agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion throughout the execution. The goal of the remaining agents is to quickly agree on this correct opinion. At each round, one agent chosen uniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the opinions of l random agents and then updates its opinion according to some rule. \r\nWe consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they only revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently sample. \r\nThis setting encompasses very popular opinion dynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-k majority rules. \r\n\r\nQualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient  convergence. Specifically, we prove that any dynamics requires Omega(n^2) expected time, even under a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete access to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case l=n. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which l=1) correctly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower bound. \r\n\r\nThese results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that do not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct opinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may require the use of memory",

    "abstract": "Opinion diffusion is a crucial phenomenon in social networks, often underlying the way in which a collection of agents develops a consensus on relevant decisions.  Voter models are well-known theoretical models to study opinion spreading in social networks and structured populations. Their simplest version assumes that an updating agent will adopt the opinion of a neighboring agent chosen at random. These models allow us to study, for example, the probability that a certain opinion will fixate into a consensus opinion, as well as the expected time it takes for a consensus opinion to emerge. \r\n\r\nStandard voter models are oblivious to the opinions held by the agents involved in the opinion adoption process. We propose and study a context-dependent opinion spreading process on an arbitrary social graph, in which the probability that an agent abandons opinion a in favor of opinion b depends on both a and b. We discuss the relations of the model with existing voter models and then derive theoretical results for both the fixation probability and the expected consensus time for two opinions, for both the synchronous and the asynchronous update models",

This work presents an approach for generating policy-level contrastive explanations for MARL to answer a temporal user query, which specifies a sequence of tasks completed by agents with possible cooperation. The proposed approach encodes the temporal query as a PCTL* logic formula and checks if the query is feasible under a given MARL policy via probabilistic model checking. Such explanations can help reconcile discrepancies between the actual and anticipated multi-agent behaviors. The proposed approach also generates correct and complete explanations to pinpoint reasons that make a user query infeasible. We have successfully applied the proposed approach to four benchmark MARL domains (up to 9 agents in one domain). Moreover, the results of a user study show that the generated explanations significantly improve user performance and satisfaction",

    "title": "Safe Multi-agent Learning via Trapping Regions",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges of multi-agent learning lies in establishing convergence of the algorithms, as, in general, a collection of individual, self-serving agents is not guaranteed to converge with their joint policy, when learning concurrently. This is in stark contrast to most single-agent environments, and sets a prohibitive barrier for deployment in practical applications, as it induces uncertainty in long term behavior of the system. In this work, we apply the concept of trapping regions, known from qualitative theory of dynamical systems, to create safety sets in the joint strategy space for decentralized learning. We propose a binary partitioning algorithm for verification that candidate sets form trapping regions in systems with known learning dynamics, and a heuristic sampling algorithm for scenarios where learning dynamics are not known. We demonstrate the applications to a regularized version of Dirac Generative Adversarial Network,  a four-intersection traffic control scenario run in a state of the art open-source microscopic traffic simulator SUMO, and a mathematical model of economic competition",

We show how online goal recognition can be incorporated into an MCTS-based intention scheduler, and evaluate our approach in a range of scenarios.

    "abstract": "Repeated games consider a situation where multiple agents are motivated by their independent rewards throughout learning. In general, the dynamics of their learning become complex. Especially when their rewards compete with each other like zero-sum games, the dynamics often do not converge to their optimum, i.e., the Nash equilibrium. To tackle such complexity, many studies have understood various learning algorithms as dynamical systems and discovered qualitative insights among the algorithms. However, such studies have yet to handle multi-memory games (where agents can memorize actions they played in the past and choose their actions based on their memories), even though memorization plays a pivotal role in artificial intelligence and interpersonal relationship. This study extends two major learning algorithms in games, i.e., replicator dynamics and gradient ascent, into multi-memory games. Then, we prove their dynamics are identical. Furthermore, theoretically and experimentally, we clarify that the learning dynamics diverge from the Nash equilibrium in multi-memory zero-sum games and reach heteroclinic cycles (sojourn longer around the boundary of the strategy space), providing a fundamental advance in learning in games",

However, existing works either broadcast the messages leading to information redundancy, or learn targeted communication by modeling all the other agents as targets, which is not scalable when the number of agents varies. In this work, to tackle the scalability problem of MARL communication for partially-observed tasks, we propose a novel framework Transformer-based Email Mechanism (TEM). The agents adopt local communication to send messages only to the ones that can be observed without modeling all the agents. Inspired by human cooperation with email forwarding, we design message chains to forward information to cooperate with the agents outside the observation range. We introduce Transformer to encode and decode the message chain to choose the next receiver selectively. Empirically, TEM outperforms the baselines on multiple cooperative MARL benchmarks.

    "title": "Beyond Strict Competition: Approximate Convergence of Multi-agent Q-Learning Dynamics",
    "abstract": "The behaviour of multi-agent learning in competitive settings is often considered under the restrictive assumption of a zero-sum game. Only under this strict requirement is the behaviour of learning well understood; beyond this, learning dynamics can often display non-convergent behaviours which prevent fixed-point analysis. Nonetheless, many relevant competitive games do not satisfy the zero-sum assumption.\r\nMotivated by this, we study a smooth variant of Q-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning dynamics which balances the agents' tendency to maximise their payoffs with their propensity to explore the state space. We examine this dynamic in games which are `close' to network zero-sum games and find that Q-Learning converges to a neighbourhood around a unique equilibrium. The size of the neighbourhood is determined by the `distance' to the zero-sum game, as well as the exploration rates of the agents. We complement these results by providing a method whereby, given an arbitrary network game, the `nearest' network zero-sum game can be found efficiently. Importantly, our theoretical guarantees are widely applicable in different game settings, regardless of whether the dynamics ultimately reach an equilibrium, or remain non convergent",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study a computational version of the principal-agent problem -- a classic problem in Economics that arises when a principal desires to contract an agent to carry out some task, but has incomplete information about the agent or their subsequent actions. The key challenge in this setting is for the principal to design a contract for the agent such that the agent's preferences are then aligned with those of the principal. We study this problem using a variation of Boolean games, where multiple players each choose valuations for Boolean variables under their control, seeking the satisfaction of a personal goal formula. In our setting, the principal can only observe some subset of these variables, and the principal chooses a contract which rewards players on the basis of the assignments they make for the variables that are observable to the principal. The principal's challenge is to design a contract so that, firstly, the principal's goal is achieved in some or all Nash equilibrium choices, and secondly, that the principal is able to verify that their goal is satisfied.

The predicted distribution is used for computing a normality score for the agents, which allows the detection of the misbehavior of other agents. To explore the robustness of the proposed detection scheme, we formulate the worst-case attack against our scheme as a constrained reinforcement learning problem.

    "abstract": "The use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods in coordinating traffic lights (CTL) has become increasingly popular, treating each intersection as an agent. However, existing MARL approaches either treat each agent absolutely homogeneous, i.e., same network and parameter for each agent, or treat each agent completely heterogeneous, i.e., different networks and parameters for each agent. This creates a difficult balance between accuracy and complexity, especially in large-scale CTL. To address this challenge, we propose a grouped MARL method named GPLight. We first mine the similarity between agent environment considering both real-time traffic flow and static fine-grained road topology. Then we propose two loss functions to maintain a learnable and dynamic clustering, one that uses mutual information estimation for better stability, and the other that maximizes separability between groups. Finally, GPLight enforces the agents in a group to share the same network and parameters. This approach reduces complexity by promoting cooperation within the same group of agents while reflecting differences between groups to ensure accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 1,089 intersections.

    "abstract": "Sharing intentions is crucial for efficient cooperation in communication-enabled multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work applies static or undirected graphs to determine the order of interaction. However, the static graph is not general for complex cooperative tasks, and the parallel message-passing update in the undirected graph with cycles cannot guarantee convergence. To solve this problem, we propose Deep Hierarchical Communication Graph (DHCG) to learn the dependency relationships between agents based on their messages. The relationships are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the selection of the proper topology is viewed as an action and trained in an end-to-end fashion. To eliminate the cycles in the graph, we apply an acyclicity constraint as intrinsic rewards and then project the graph in the admissible solution set of DAGs. As a result, DHCG removes redundant communication edges for cost improvement and guarantees convergence. To show the effectiveness of the learned graphs, we propose policy-based and value-based DHCG. Policy-based DHCG factorizes the joint policy in an auto-regressive manner, and value-based DHCG factorizes the joint value function to individual value functions and pairwise payoff functions.

    "abstract": "We study a rumor spreading model where individuals are connected via a network structure. Initially, only a small subset of the individuals are spreading a rumor. Each individual who is connected to a spreader, starts spreading the rumor with some probability as a function of their trust in the spreader, quantified by the Jaccard similarity index. Furthermore, the probability that a spreader diffuses the rumor decreases over time until they fully lose their interest and stop spreading.\r\n\r\nWe focus on determining the graph parameters which govern the magnitude and pace that the rumor spreads in this model. We prove that for the rumor to spread to a sizable fraction of the individuals, the network needs to enjoy ``strong'' expansion properties and most nodes should be in ``well-connected'' communities. Both of these characteristics are, arguably, present in real-world social networks up to a certain degree, shedding light on the driving force behind the extremely fast spread of rumors in social networks.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we formulate a large range of countermeasures to cease the spread of a rumor. We introduce four fundamental criteria which a countermeasure ideally should possess. We evaluate all the proposed countermeasures by conducting experiments on real-world social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We conclude that our novel decentralized countermeasures (which are executed by the individuals) generally outperform the previously studied centralized ones (which need to be imposed by a third entity such as the government)",

    "abstract": "This study extends the recently-developed LaCAM algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). LaCAM is a sub-optimal search-based algorithm that uses lazy successor generation to dramatically reduce the planning effort. We present two enhancements. First, we propose its anytime version, called LaCAM*, which eventually converges to optima, provided that solution costs are accumulated transition costs. Second, we improve the successor generation to quickly obtain initial solutions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate their utility. For instance, LaCAM* sub-optimally solved 99% of the instances retrieved from the MAPF benchmark, where the number of agents varied up to a thousand, within ten seconds on a standard desktop PC, while ensuring eventual convergence to optima; developing a new horizon of MAPF algorithms",

Conventional MRMP studies mostly take the form of two-phase planning that constructs roadmaps and then finds inter-robot collision-free paths on those roadmaps. In contrast, SSSP simultaneously performs roadmap construction and collision-free pathfinding. This is realized by uniting techniques of single-robot sampling-based motion planning and search techniques of multi-agent pathfinding on discretized spaces. Doing so builds the small search space, leading to quick MRMP. SSSP ensures finding a solution eventually if exists. Our empirical evaluations in various scenarios demonstrate that SSSP significantly outperforms standard approaches to MRMP, i.e., solving more problem instances much faster. We also applied SSSP to planning for 32 ground robots in a dense situation",

A task allocation algorithm based on Fisher market clearing (FMC_TA), that can be performed either centrally or distributively, has been shown to produce high quality allocations in comparison to both centralized and distributed state of the art incomplete optimization algorithms. However, the algorithm is synchronous and therefore depends on perfect communication between agents.\r\n\r\nWe propose FMC_ATA, an asynchronous version of FMC_TA, which is robust to message latency and message loss. In contrast to the former version of the algorithm, FMC_ATA allows agents to identify dynamic events and initiate the generation of an updated allocation. Thus, it is more compatible for dynamic environments. We further investigate the conditions in which the distributed version of the algorithm is preferred over the centralized version. Our results indicate that the proposed asynchronous distributed algorithm produces consistent results even when the communication level is extremely poor",

    "abstract": "In the study of reactive systems, qualitative properties are usually easier to model and analyze than quantitative properties. This is especially true in systems where mutually beneficial cooperation between agents is possible, such as multi-agent systems. The large number of possible payoffs available to agents in reactive systems with quantitative properties means that there are many scenarios in which agents deviate from mutually beneficial outcomes in order to gain negligible payoff improvements. This behavior often leads to less desirable outcomes for all agents involved. For this reason we study satisficing goals, derived from a decision-making approach aimed at meeting a good-enough outcome instead of pure optimization. By considering satisficing goals, we are able to employ efficient automata-based algorithms to find pure-strategy Nash equilibria. We then show that these algorithms extend to scenarios in which agents have multiple thresholds, providing an approximation of optimization while still retaining the possibility of mutually beneficial cooperation and efficient automata-based algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a one-way correspondence between the existence of epsilon-equilibria and the existence of equilibria in games where agents have multiple thresholds",

A crucial part of coalition formation that is extensively studied in AI is coalition structure generation: partitioning agents into coalitions to maximize overall value. \r\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method for coalition structure generation by introducing a compact and efficient representation of coalition structures. Our representation partitions the solution space into smaller, more manageable subspaces that gather structures containing coalitions of specific sizes. Our proposed method combines two new algorithms, one which leverages our compact representation and a branch-and-bound technique to generate optimal coalition structures, and another that utilizes a preprocessing phase to identify the most promising sets of coalitions to evaluate. Additionally, we show how parts of the solution space can be gathered into groups to avoid their redundant evaluation and we investigate the computational gain that is achieved by avoiding that redundant processing. Through this approach, our algorithm is able to prune the solution space more efficiently. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to prior state-of-the-art methods in generating optimal coalition structures under several value distributions",

They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies",

Previous works argue that complex dynamics between agents and the huge exploration space in MARL scenarios amplify the vulnerability of classical count-based exploration methods when combined with agents parameterized by neural networks, resulting in inefficient exploration. In this paper, we show that introducing constrained joint policy diversity into a classical count-based method can significantly improve exploration when agents are parameterized by neural networks. Specifically, we propose a joint policy diversity to measure the difference between current joint policy and previous joint policies, and then use a filtering-based exploration constraint to further refine the joint policy diversity. Under the sparse-reward setting, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the multiple-particle environment, the Google Research Football, and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.

For example, a spacious hall leads to more reverberation. Room Impulse Responses (RIR) are commonly used to characterize environment acoustics as a function of the scene geometry, materials, and source/receiver locations. Traditionally, RIRs are measured by setting up a loudspeaker and microphone in the environment for all source/receiver locations, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We propose to let two robots measure the environment's acoustics by actively moving and emitting/receiving sweep signals. We also devise a collaborative multi-agent policy where these two robots are trained to explore the environment's acoustics while being rewarded for wide exploration and accurate prediction. We show that the robots learn to collaborate and move to explore environment acoustics while minimizing the prediction error.

Every agent learns to cooperate without access to the observations and policies of others. However, the decentralized training of multi-agent is of great difficulty due to non-stationarity, especially when other agents' policies are also in learning during training. To overcome this, we propose to learn a dynamic policy belief for each agent to predict the current policies of other agents and accordingly condition the policy of its own. To quickly adapt to the development of others' policies, we introduce a historical context to learn the belief inference according to a few recent action histories of other agents and a latent variational inference to model their policies by a learned distribution.

However, existing MARL approaches are mostly bound by the simultaneous actions of all agents in the Markov game (MG) framework, and few works consider the formation of equilibrium strategies via asynchronous action coordination. In view of the advantages of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) over Nash equilibrium, we construct a spatio-temporal sequential decision-making structure derived from the MG and propose an N-level policy model based on a conditional hypernetwork shared by all agents. This approach allows for asymmetric training with symmetric execution, with each agent responding optimally conditioned on the decisions made by superior agents. Agents can learn heterogeneous SE policies while still maintaining parameter sharing, which leads to reduced cost for learning and storage and enhanced scalability as the number of agents increases. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively converges to the SE policies in repeated matrix game scenarios, and performs admirably in immensely complex settings including cooperative tasks and mixed tasks",

The former involves deception, and is inherently undesirable, whereas the latter may well be a desirable goal insofar as it changes true individual qualification. We study misreporting and recourse as strategic choices by individuals within a unified framework. In particular, we propose auditing as a means to incentivize recourse actions over attribute manipulation, and characterize optimal audit policies for two types of principals, utility-maximizing and recourse-maximizing. Additionally, we consider subsidies as an incentive for recourse over manipulation, and show that even a utility-maximizing principal would be willing to devote a considerable amount of audit budget to providing such subsidies.

Although methods for mitigating unfairness are constantly proposed, little research has been conducted to understand how discrimination and bias develop during the standard training process. In this study, we propose analyzing the contribution of each subgroup (i.e., a group of data with the same sensitive attribute) in the training process to understand the cause of such bias development process. We propose a gradient-based metric to assess training subgroup contribution disparity, showing that unequal contributions from different subgroups are one source of such unfairness. One way to balance the contribution of each subgroup is through oversampling, which ensures that an equal number of samples are drawn from each subgroup during each training iteration. However, we have found that even with a balanced number of samples, the contribution of each group remains unequal, resulting in unfairness under the oversampling strategy. To address the above issues, we propose an easy but effective group contribution matching (GCM) method to match the contribution of each subgroup.

Existing efforts typically address the robust RL problem by solving a max-min problem. The main idea is to maximize the cumulative reward under the worst-possible perturbations. However, the worst-case optimization either leads to overly conservative solutions or unstable training process, which further affects the policy robustness and generalization performance. In this paper, we tackle this problem from both formulation definition and algorithm design. First, we formulate the robust RL as a max-expectation optimization problem, where the goal is to find an optimal policy under both the worst cases and the non-worst cases. Then, we propose a novel framework DRRL to solve the max-expectation optimization. Given our definition of the feasible tasks, a task generation and sequencing mechanism is introduced to dynamically output tasks at appropriate difficulty level for the current policy. With these progressive tasks, DRRL realizes dynamic multi-task learning to improve the policy robustness and the training stability.

    "title": "Towards Robust Gan-Generated Image Detection: A Multi-View Completion Representation",
    "abstract": "GAN-generated image detection now becomes the first line of defense against the malicious uses of machine-synthesized image manipulations such as deepfakes. Although some existing detectors work well in detecting clean, known GAN samples, their success is largely attributable to overfitting unstable features such as frequency artifacts, which will cause failures when facing unknown GANs or perturbation attacks. To overcome the issue, we propose a robust detection framework based on a novel multi-view image completion representation. The framework first learns various view-to-image tasks to model the diverse distributions of genuine images. Frequency-irrelevant features can be represented from the distributional discrepancies characterized by the completion models, which are stable, generalized, and robust for detecting unknown fake patterns. Then, a multi-view classification is devised with elaborated intra- and inter-view learning strategies to enhance view-specific feature representation and cross-view feature aggregation, respectively. We evaluated the generalization ability of our framework across six popular GANs at different resolutions and its robustness against a broad range of perturbation attacks. The results confirm our method's improved effectiveness, generalization, and robustness over various baselines",

    "title": "Explanation-Guided Reward Alignment",
    "abstract": "Agents often need to infer a reward function from observations to learn desired behaviors. However, agents may infer a reward function that does not align with the original intent because there can be multiple reward functions consistent with its observations. Operating based on such misaligned rewards can be risky. Furthermore, black-box representations make it difficult to verify the learned rewards and prevent harmful behavior. We present a framework for verifying and improving reward alignment using explanations and show how explanations can help detect misalignment and reveal failure cases in novel scenarios. The problem is formulated as inverse reinforcement learning from ranked trajectories. Verification tests created from the trajectory dataset are used to iteratively validate and improve reward alignment. The agent explains its learned reward and a tester signals whether the explanation passes the test. In cases where the explanation fails, the agent offers alternative explanations to gather feedback, which is then used to improve the learned reward. We analyze the efficiency of our approach in improving reward alignment using different types of explanations and demonstrate its effectiveness in five domains",

    "title": "Adversarial Behavior Exclusion for Safe Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Learning by exploration makes reinforcement learning (RL) potentially attractive for many real-world applications. However, this learning process makes RL inherently too vulnerable to be used in real-world applications where safety is of utmost importance. Most prior studies consider exploration at odds with safety and thereby restrict it using either joint optimization of task and safety or imposing constraints for safe exploration. This paper migrates from the current convention to using exploration as a key to safety by learning safety as a robust behavior that completely excludes any behavioral pattern responsible for safety violations. Adversarial Behavior Exclusion for Safe RL (AdvEx-RL) learns a behavioral representation of the agent's safety violations by approximating an optimal adversary utilizing exploration and later uses this representation to learn a separate safety policy that excludes those unsafe behaviors. In addition, AdvEx-RL ensures safety in a task-agnostic manner by acting as a safety firewall and therefore can be integrated with any RL task policy. We demonstrate the robustness of AdvEx-RL via comprehensive experiments in standard constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP) environments under 2 white-box action space perturbations as well as with changes in environment dynamics against 7 baselines. Consistently, AdvEx-RL outperforms the baselines by achieving an average safety performance of over 75% in the continuous action space with 10 times more variations in the testing environment dynamics. By using a standalone safety policy independent of conflicting objectives, AdvEx-RL also paves the way for interpretable safety behavior analysis as we show in our user study",

While drifts in model accuracy have been widely investigated, drifts in fairness metrics over time remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose FEAMOE, a novel \"mixture-of-experts\" inspired framework aimed at learning fairer, more interpretable models that can also rapidly adjust to drifts in both the accuracy and the fairness of a classifier. We illustrate our framework for three popular fairness measures and demonstrate how drift can be handled with respect to these fairness constraints. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our framework as applied to a mixture of linear experts is able to perform comparably to neural networks in terms of accuracy while producing fairer models. We then use the large-scale HMDA dataset and show that various models trained on HMDA demonstrate drift and FEAMOE can ably handle these drifts with respect to all the considered fairness measures and maintain model accuracy. We also prove that the proposed framework allows for producing fast Shapley value explanations, which makes computationally efficient feature attribution based explanations of model decisions readily available via FEAMOE",

    "abstract": "Language models are known to be vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the input to mislead DNNs. It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs before real-world deployment. However, existing word-level attacks have two major deficiencies: (1) They may change the semantics of the original sentence. (2) The generated adversarial sample can appear unnatural to humans due to the introduction of out-of-domain substitute words. In this paper, to address such drawbacks, we propose a semantics- and domain-aware word-level attack method. Specifically, we greedily replace the important words in a sentence with the ones suggested by a language model. The language model is trained to be semantics- and domain-aware via contrastive learning and in-domain pre-training. Furthermore, to balance the quality of adversarial examples and the attack success rate, we propose an iterative updating framework to optimize the contrastive learning loss and the in-domain pre-training loss in circular order. Comprehensive experimental comparisons confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, our strategy can achieve over 3\\% improvement in attack success rates and 9.8\\% improvement in the quality of adversarial examples",

    "title": "Tracking Different Ant Species: An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework and a Dataset for Multi-object Tracking",
    "abstract": "Tracking individuals is a vital part of many experiments conducted to understand collective behaviour. Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable racking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species'  appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively. We compare our proposed framework against other domain-adaptive and non-domain-adaptive multi-object tracking baselines using this dataset and show that incorporating domain adaptation at multiple levels of the tracking pipeline yields significant improvements.

    "abstract": "Text-based person search aims to retrieve the specified person images given a textual description. The key to tackling such a challenging task is to learn powerful multi-modal representations. Towards this, we propose a Relation and Sensitivity aware representation learning method (RaSa), including two novel tasks: Relation-Aware learning (RA) and Sensitivity-Aware learning (SA). For one thing, existing methods cluster representations of all positive pairs without distinction and overlook the noise problem caused by the weak positive pairs where the text and the paired image have noise correspondences, thus leading to overfitting learning. RA offsets the overfitting risk by introducing a novel positive relation detection task (i.e., learning to distinguish strong and weak positive pairs). For another thing, learning invariant representation under data augmentation (i.e., being insensitive to some transformations) is a general practice for improving representation's robustness in existing methods. Beyond that, we encourage the representation to perceive the sensitive transformation by SA (i.e., learning to detect the replaced words), thus promoting the representation's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that RaSa outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 6.94%, 4.45% and 15.35% in terms of Rank@1 on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets, respectively.

Meanwhile, there is an increasing demand for single image super-resolution with arbitrary scale factors in real-world scenarios. Many approaches adopt scale-specific multi-path learning to cope with multi-scale super-resolution with a single network. However, these methods require a large number of parameters. To achieve a better balance between the reconstruction quality and parameter amounts, we proposes a learnable interpolation method that leverages the advantages of neural networks and interpolation methods to tackle the scale-arbitrary super-resolution task. The scale factor is treated as a function parameter for generating the kernel weights for the learnable interpolation. We demonstrate that the learnable interpolation builds a bridge between neural networks and traditional interpolation methods. Experiments show that the proposed learnable interpolation requires much fewer parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution methods",

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation is a challenging task due to its structured data sequence nature. Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction of body joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping joints and rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel approach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverages high-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation. Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-order attention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitates first-order \"joint-joint\", second-order \"bone-joint\", and high-order \"hyperbone-joint\" interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavy situations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into the transformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parameters and significantly lower computational costs. Moreover, HDFormer demonstrates broad real-world applicability, enabling real-time, accurate 3D pose estimation. The source code is in https://github.com/hyer/HDFormer",

    "abstract": "Most infrared small target detection (ISTD) networks focus on building effective neural blocks or feature fusion modules but none describes the ISTD process from the image evolution perspective. The directional evolution of image pixels influenced by convolution, pooling and surrounding pixels is analogous to the movement of fluid elements constrained by surrounding variables ang particles. Inspired by this, we explore a novel research routine by abstracting the movement of pixels in the ISTD process as the flow of fluid in fluid dynamics (FD). Specifically, a new Fluid Dynamics-Inspired Network (FDI-Net) is devised for ISTD. Based on Taylor Central Difference (TCD) method, the TCD feature extraction block is designed, where convolution and Transformer structures are combined for local and global information. The pixel motion equation during the ISTD process is derived from the Navier–Stokes (N-S) equation, constructing a N-S Refinement Module that refines extracted features with edge details. Thus, the TCD feature extraction block determines the primary movement direction of pixels during detection, while the N-S Refinement Module corrects some skewed directions of the pixel stream to supplement the edge details. Experiments on IRSTD-1k and SIRST demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in terms of evaluation metrics",

To handle the issue, we aim to involve Transformer into cost aggregation. However, another problem may occur due to the quadratically growing computational complexity caused by Transformer, resulting in memory overflow and inference latency. In this paper, we overcome these limits with an efficient Transformer-based cost aggregation network, namely CostFormer. The Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer(RDACT) is proposed to aggregate long-range features on cost volume via self-attention mechanisms along the depth and spatial dimensions.

    "abstract": "The performance of existing supervised neuron segmentation methods is highly dependent on the number of accurate annotations, especially when applied to large scale electron microscopy (EM) data. By extracting semantic information from unlabeled data, self-supervised methods can improve the performance of downstream tasks, among which the mask image model (MIM) has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in recovering original information from masked images. However, due to the high degree of structural locality in EM images, as well as the existence of considerable noise, many voxels contain little discriminative information, making MIM pretraining inefficient on the neuron segmentation task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decision-based MIM that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically search for optimal image masking ratio and masking strategy. Due to the vast exploration space, using single-agent RL for voxel prediction is impractical. Therefore, we treat each input patch as an agent with a shared behavior policy, allowing for multi-agent collaboration. Furthermore, this multi-agent model can capture dependencies between voxels, which is beneficial for the downstream segmentation task. Experiments conducted on representative EM datasets demonstrate that our approach has a significant advantage over alternative self-supervised methods on the task of neuron segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called CIG based on controllable image generation to directly tackle these two issues. Our main idea is to generate extra training samples with specific labels near category boundaries, and the sample generation is biased toward the less-represented categories. To achieve controllable image generation, we seek to separate structural and categorical information of images based on structural similarity, categorical similarity, and reconstruction constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our new CIG approach in three different image ordinal regression scenarios. The results demonstrate that CIG can be flexibly integrated with off-the-shelf image encoders or ordinal regression models to achieve improvement, and further, the improvement is more significant for minority categories",

In this context, we build Win-win Cooperation (WiCo) to exploit complementary nature of two types of methods on both interaction and integration aspects for achieving a win-win improvement. For the interaction aspect, Complementary Feature Interaction (CFI) introduces prior object information to bottom-up branch and provides fine-grained information to top-down branch for complementary feature enhancement.

In recent years, owing to the strong ability of self-attention in capturing long-range dependencies, Transformer based methods have achieved promising performance on multifarious image restoration tasks. However, the canonical self-attention leads to quadratic complexity with respect to input size, hindering its further applications in image restoration.

Specifically, a strip attention unit is proposed to harvest the contextual information for each pixel from its adjacent pixels in the same row or column. By employing this operation in different directions, each location can perceive information from an expanded region. Furthermore, we apply various receptive fields in different feature groups to enhance representation learning.

RZCR consists of a visual semantic fusion-based radical information extractor (RIE) and a knowledge graph character reasoner (KGR). RIE aims to recognize candidate radicals and their possible structural relations from character images in parallel.

In this paper, we propose the illumination-coupled domain adaptation framework(ICDA) to effectively avoid the illumination gap and mitigate the dataset gap by coupling daytime and nighttime images as a whole with semantic relevance. Specifically, we first design a new composite enhancement method(CEM) that considers not only illumination but also spatial consistency to construct the source and target domain pairs, which provides the basic adaptation unit for our ICDA. Next, to avoid the illumination gap, we devise the Deformable Attention Relevance(DAR) module to capture the semantic relevance inside each domain pair, which can couple the daytime and nighttime images at the feature level and adaptively guide the predictions of nighttime images. Besides, to mitigate the dataset gap and acquire domain-invariant semantic relevance, we propose the Prototype-based Class Alignment(PCA) module, which improves the usage of category information and performs fine-grained alignment.

    "title": "Timestamp-Supervised Action Segmentation from the Perspective of Clustering",
    "abstract": "Video action segmentation under timestamp supervision has recently received much attention due to lower annotation costs. Most existing methods generate pseudo-labels for all frames in each video to train the segmentation model. However, these methods suffer from incorrect pseudo-labels, especially for the semantically unclear frames in the transition region between two consecutive actions, which we call ambiguous intervals. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework from the perspective of clustering, which includes the following two parts. First, pseudo-label ensembling generates incomplete but high-quality pseudo-label sequences, where the frames in ambiguous intervals have no pseudo-labels. Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the pseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the pseudo-label sequences to train the model. We further introduce a clustering loss, which encourages the features of frames within the same action segment more compact. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method",

    "title": "LION: Label Disambiguation for Semi-supervised Facial Expression Recognition with Progressive Negative Learning",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised deep facial expression recognition (SS-DFER) has recently attracted rising research interest due to its more practical setting of abundant unlabeled data. However, there are two main problems unconsidered in current SS-DFER methods: 1) label ambiguity, i.e., given labels mismatch with facial expressions; 2) inefficient utilization of unlabeled data with low-confidence. In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER method, including a Label DIsambiguation module and a PrOgressive Negative Learning module, namely LION, to simultaneously address both problems. Specifically, the label disambiguation module operates on labeled data, including data with accurate labels (clear data) and ambiguous labels (ambiguous data). It first uses clear data to calculate prototypes for all the expression classes, and then re-assign a candidate label set to all the ambiguous data. Based on the prototypes and the candidate label set, the ambiguous data can be relabeled more accurately. As for unlabeled data with low-confidence, the progressive negative learning module is developed to iteratively mine more complete complementary labels, which can guide the model to reduce the association between data and corresponding complementary labels. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in SS-DFER and surpasses fully-supervised baselines.

    "title": "Improve Video Representation with Temporal Adversarial Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Recent works reveal that adversarial augmentation benefits the generalization of neural networks (NNs) if used in an appropriate manner. In this paper, we introduce Temporal Adversarial Augmentation (TA), a novel video augmentation technique that utilizes temporal attention. Unlike conventional adversarial augmentation, TA is specifically designed to shift the attention distributions of neural networks with respect to video clips by maximizing a temporal-related loss function. We demonstrate that TA will obtain diverse temporal views, which significantly affect the focus of neural networks. Training with these examples remedies the flaw of unbalanced temporal information perception and enhances the ability to defend against temporal shifts, ultimately leading to better generalization. To leverage TA, we propose Temporal Video Adversarial Fine-tuning (TAF) framework for improving video representations. TAF is a model-agnostic, generic, and interpretability-friendly training strategy. We evaluate TAF with four powerful models (TSM, GST, TAM, and TPN) over three challenging temporal-related benchmarks (Something-something V1&V2 and diving48). Experimental results demonstrate that TAF effectively improves the test accuracy of these models with notable margins without introducing additional parameters or computational costs. As a byproduct, TAF also improves the robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TAF",

    "abstract": "Glass-like objects are widespread in daily life but remain intractable to be segmented for most existing methods. The transparent property makes it difficult to be distinguished from background, while the tiny separation boundary further impedes the acquisition of their exact contour. In this paper, by revealing the key co-evolution demand of semantic and boundary learning, we propose a Selective Mutual Evolution (SME) module to enable the reciprocal feature learning between them. Then to exploit the global shape context, we propose a Structurally Attentive Refinement (SAR) module to conduct a fine-grained feature refinement for those ambiguous points around the boundary. Finally, to further utilize the multi-scale representation, we integrate the above two modules into a cascaded structure and then introduce a Reciprocal Feature Evolution Network (RFENet) for effective glass-like object segmentation.

The main contribution is based on an interesting finding of the significant existence of the middle frequency sub-band during the CNN process. Consequently, a Sub-Band based Attention (SBA) module is proposed, which uniformly adopts either the high or middle sub-bands of the encoder features to boost the decoder features and thus concretely improve the feature discrimination. A strong encoder supplying informative sub-bands is also very important, while we highly value the local-and-global information enriched CNN features. Therefore, a Transformer Attended Convolution (TAC) module as the main encoder block is introduced. It takes the Transformer features to boost the CNN features with stronger long-range object contexts. The combination of SBA and TAC leads to a novel polyp segmentation framework, SBA-Net. It adopts TAC to effectively obtain encoded features which also input to SBA, so that efficient sub-bands based attention maps can be generated for progressively decoding the bottleneck features. Consequently, SBA-Net can achieve the robust polyp segmentation, as the experimental results demonstrate",

Taking inspiration from Bézier decomposition on NURBS models, we transfer it to guide point cloud segmentation casting off primitive types. A joint optimization framework is proposed to learn Bézier primitive segmentation and geometric fitting simultaneously on a cascaded architecture.

We also introduce a reconstruction module where we successfully process multiple CAD models with different primitives simultaneously.

    "abstract": "There are two problems that widely exist in current end-to-end sign language processing architecture. One is the CTC spike phenomenon which weakens the visual representational ability in Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). The other one is the exposure bias problem which leads to the accumulation of translation errors during inference in  Sign Language Translation (SLT). In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing contrast learning, aiming to enhance both visual-level feature representation and semantic-level error tolerance. Specifically, to alleviate CTC spike phenomenon and enhance visual-level representation, we design a visual contrastive loss by minimizing visual feature distance between different augmented samples of frames in one sign video, so that the model can further explore features by utilizing numerous unlabeled frames in an unsupervised way. To alleviate exposure bias problem and improve semantic-level error tolerance, we design a semantic contrastive loss by re-inputting the predicted sentence into semantic module and comparing features of ground-truth sequence  and predicted sequence, for exposing model to its own mistakes. Besides, we propose two new metrics, i.e., Blank Rate and Consecutive Wrong Word Rate to directly reflect our improvement on the two problems.

Large and complex search spaces with versatile building operators and structures provide more opportunities to brew promising architectures, yet pose severe challenges on efficient exploration and exploitation. Subsequently, several search space shrinkage methods optimize by selecting a single sub-region that contains some well-performing networks.  Small performance and efficiency gains are observed with these methods but such techniques leave room for significantly improved search performance and are ineffective at retaining architectural diversity. We propose LISSNAS, an automated algorithm that shrinks a large space into a diverse, small search space with SOTA search performance. Our approach leverages locality, the relationship between structural and performance similarity, to efficiently extract many pockets of well-performing networks. We showcase our method on an array of search spaces spanning various sizes and datasets. We accentuate the effectiveness of our shrunk spaces when used in one-shot search by achieving the best Top-1 accuracy in two different search spaces.

    "abstract": "Scene text image super-resolution (STISR), aiming to improve image quality while boosting downstream scene text recognition accuracy, has recently achieved great success. However, most existing methods treat the foreground (character regions) and background (non-character regions) equally in the forward process, and neglect the disturbance from the complex background, thus limiting the performance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method LEMMA that explicitly models character regions to produce high-level text-specific guidance for super-resolution. To model the location of characters effectively, we propose the location enhancement module to extract character region features based on the attention map sequence. Besides, we propose the multi-modal alignment module to perform bidirectional visual-semantic alignment to generate high-quality prior guidance, which is then incorporated into the super-resolution branch in an adaptive manner using the proposed adaptive fusion module.

    "abstract": "Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promising performance in self-supervised learning for both 2D and 3D computer vision. However, existing MAE-style methods can only learn from the data of a single modality, i.e., either images or point clouds, which neglect the implicit semantic and geometric correlation between 2D and 3D. In this paper, we explore how the 2D modality can benefit 3D masked autoencoding, and propose Joint-MAE, a 2D-3D joint MAE framework for self-supervised 3D point cloud pre-training. Joint-MAE randomly masks an input 3D point cloud and its projected 2D images, and then reconstructs the masked information of the two modalities. For better cross-modal interaction, we construct our JointMAE by two hierarchical 2D-3D embedding modules, a joint encoder, and a joint decoder with modal-shared and model-specific decoders. On top of this, we further introduce two cross-modal strategies to boost the 3D representation learning, which are local-aligned attention mechanisms for 2D-3D semantic cues, and a cross-reconstruction loss for 2D-3D geometric constraints. By our pre-training paradigm, Joint-MAE achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, e.g., 92.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40 and 86.07% accuracy on the hardest split of ScanObjectNN",

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on supervised learning-based image denoising methods. However, these methods rely on large-scale noisy-clean image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Denoising methods with self-supervised training that can be trained with only noisy images have been proposed to address the limitation. These methods are based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown promising performance. However, CNN-based methods do not consider using nonlocal self-similarities essential in the traditional method, which can cause performance limitations. This paper presents self-similarity attention (SS-Attention), a novel self-attention module that can capture nonlocal self-similarities to solve the problem. We focus on designing a lightweight self-attention module in a pixel-wise manner, which is nearly impossible to implement using the classic self-attention module due to the quadratically increasing complexity with spatial resolution. Furthermore, we integrate SS-Attention into the blind-spot network called self-similarity-based blind-spot network (SS-BSN). We conduct the experiments on real-world image denoising tasks. The proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised denoising on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) benchmark datasets",

In practice, however, the obtained features is often mixed with domain-specific information which causes performance degradation. To overcome this fundamental limitation, this article presents a novel independent feature decomposition and instance alignment method (IndUDA in short). Specifically, based on an invertible flow, we project the base features into a decomposed latent space with domain-invariant and domain-specific dimensions. To drive semantic decomposition independently, we then swap the domain-invariant part across source and target domain samples with the same category and require their inverted features are consistent in class-level with the original features.  By treating domain-specific information as noise, we replace it by Gaussian noise and further regularize source model training by instance alignment, i.e., requiring the base features close to the corresponding reconstructed features, respectively.

A prominent direction to reduce the cost is to learn with noisy labels, which are ubiquitous in the real-world applications. A critical challenge for such a learning task is to reduce the effect of network memorization on the falsely-labeled data.  In this work, we propose an iterative selection approach based on the Weibull mixture model, which identifies clean data by considering the overall learning dynamics of each data instance. In contrast to the previous small-loss heuristics, we leverage the observation that deep network is easy to memorize and hard to forget clean data. In particular, we measure the difficulty of memorization and forgetting for each instance via the transition times between being misclassified and being memorized in training, and integrate them into a novel metric for selection. Based on the proposed metric, we retain a subset of identified clean data and repeat the selection procedure to iteratively refine the clean subset, which is finally used for model training. To validate our method, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic noisy datasets and real-world web data, and our strategy outperforms existing noisy-label learning methods",

Existing video-and-language learning models commonly sample multiple frames for training instead of observing all. These sampled deputies greatly improve computational efficiency, but do they represent the original video content enough with no more redundancy? In this work, we propose a dual video summarization framework and verify it in the context of video captioning. Given the video frames, we firstly extract the visual representation based on the ViT model fine-tuned on the video-text domain. Then we summarize the keyframes according to the frame-lever score.  To compress the number of keyframes as much as possible while ensuring the quality of captioning, we learn a cross-modal video summarizer to select the most semantically consistent frames according to the pseudo score label. Top K frames ( K is no more than 3% of the entire video.) are chosen to form the video representation. Moreover, to evaluate the static appearance and temporal information of video, we design the ranking scheme of video representation from two aspects: feature-oriented and sequence-oriented. Finally, we generate the descriptions with a lightweight LSTM decoder. The experiment results on the MSR-VTT and MSVD dataset reveal that, for the generative task as video captioning, a small number of keyframes can convey the same semantic information to perform well on captioning, or even better than the original sampling",

    "title": "Part Aware Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in self-supervised action recognition using skeleton sequences with contrastive learning. It has been observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is often represented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageous for skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the entire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR learns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment results demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity significantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed SkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD datasets.

In this paper, we propose an Audio-Queried Transformer architecture, AQFormer, where we define a set of object queries conditioned on audio information and associate each of them to particular sounding objects. Explicit object-level semantic correspondence between audio and visual modalities is established by gathering object information from visual features with predefined audio queries. Besides, an Audio-Bridged Temporal Interaction module is proposed to exchange sounding object-relevant information among multiple frames with the bridge of audio features.

To achieve intra-domain adaptation, we first introduce a pseudo-label aggregation based on the intra-domain optimal transport to help the model align the feature distribution of unlabeled target samples and the prototype. At the inter-domain level, we propose a cross-domain alignment loss to help the model use the target prototype for cross-domain knowledge transfer.

To realize more comprehensive visual-linguistic interaction, we propose to enrich phrases with coupled pixel and object contexts by designing a Phrase-Pixel-Object Transformer Decoder (PPO-TD), where both fine-grained part details and coarse-grained entity clues are aggregated to phrase features. In addition, we also propose a Phrase-Object Contrastive Loss (POCL) to pull closer the matched phrase-object pairs and push away unmatched ones for aggregating more precise object contexts from more phrase-relevant object tokens. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance with large margins",

    "abstract": "Most existing ultra-high resolution (UHR) segmentation methods always struggle in the dilemma of balancing memory cost and local characterization accuracy, which are both taken into account in our proposed Guided Patch-Grouping Wavelet Transformer (GPWFormer) that achieves impressive performances. In this work, GPWFormer is a Transformer (T)-CNN (C) mutual leaning framework, where T takes the whole UHR image as input and harvests both local details and fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies, while C takes downsampled image as input for learning the category-wise deep context. For the sake of high inference speed and low computation complexity, T partitions the original UHR image into patches and groups them dynamically, then learns the low-level local details with the lightweight multi-head Wavelet Transformer (WFormer) network. Meanwhile, the fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies are also captured during this process, since patches that are far away in the spatial domain can also be assigned to the same group. In addition, masks produced by C are utilized to guide the patch grouping process, providing a heuristics decision. Moreover, the congruence constraints between the two branches are also exploited to maintain the spatial consistency among the patches. Overall, we stack the multi-stage process in a pyramid way. Experiments show that GPWFormer outperforms the existing methods with significant improvements on five benchmark datasets",

Current methods either fail to leverage the local details or are computationally expensive. What's worse, they fail to leverage the heterogeneous concepts in data. In this paper, we propose the Disentangled Conceptualization and Set-to-set Alignment (DiCoSA) to simulate the conceptualizing and reasoning process of human beings. For disentangled conceptualization, we divide the coarse feature into multiple latent factors related to semantic concepts. For set-to-set alignment, where a set of visual concepts correspond to a set of textual concepts, we propose an adaptive pooling method to aggregate semantic concepts to address the partial matching. In particular, since we encode concepts independently in only a few dimensions, DiCoSA is superior at efficiency and granularity, ensuring fine-grained interactions using a similar computational complexity as coarse-grained alignment.

    "abstract": "Incorporating physics in human motion capture to avoid artifacts like floating, foot sliding, and ground penetration is a promising direction. Existing solutions always adopt kinematic results as reference motions, and the physics is treated as a post-processing module. However, due to the depth ambiguity, monocular motion capture inevitably suffers from noises, and the noisy reference often leads to failure for physics-based tracking. To address the obstacles, our key-idea is to employ physics as denoising guidance in the reverse diffusion process to reconstruct physically plausible human motion from a modeled pose probability distribution. Specifically, we first train a latent gaussian model that encodes the uncertainty of 2D-to-3D lifting to facilitate reverse diffusion. Then, a physics module is constructed to track the motion sampled from the distribution. The discrepancies between the tracked motion and image observation are used to provide explicit guidance for the reverse diffusion model to refine the motion. With several iterations, the physics-based tracking and kinematic denoising promote each other to generate a physically plausible human motion. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous physics-based methods in both joint accuracy and success rate.

    "title": "SWAT: Spatial Structure Within and Among Tokens",
    "abstract": "Modeling visual data as tokens (i.e., image patches) using attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks or convolutions has been highly effective in recent years. Such methods usually have a common pipeline: a tokenization method, followed by a set of layers/blocks for information mixing, both within and among tokens. When image patches are converted into tokens, they are often flattened, discarding the spatial structure within each patch. As a result, any processing that follows (eg: multi-head self-attention) may fail to recover and/or benefit from such information. In this paper, we argue that models can have significant gains when spatial structure is preserved during tokenization, and is explicitly used during the mixing stage. We propose two key contributions: (1) Structure-aware Tokenization and, (2) Structure-aware Mixing, both of which can be combined with existing models with minimal effort. We introduce a family of models (SWAT), showing improvements over the likes of DeiT, MLP-Mixer and Swin Transformer, across multiple benchmarks including ImageNet classification and ADE20K segmentation.

In this work, to address the student model's limitation, we propose a novel flexible KD framework, Integrating Matched Features using Attentive Logit in Knowledge Distillation (IMF). Our approach introduces an intermediate feature distiller (IFD) to improve the overall performance of the student model by directly distilling the teacher's knowledge into branches of student models. The generated output of IFD, which is trained by the teacher model, is effectively combined by attentive logit. We use only a few blocks of the student and the trained IFD during inference, requiring an equal or less number of parameters.

Our study is motivated by the limitations of current Text2Image attacking approaches that still rely on manual trials to create adversarial prompts. To address such limitations, we develop CharGrad, a character-level gradient based attacking framework that replaces specific characters of a prompt with pixel-level similar ones by interactively learning the perturbation direction for the prompt and updating the attacking examiner for the generated image based on a novel proxy perturbation representation for characters.  We evaluate CharGrad using the texts from two public image captioning datasets. Results demonstrate that CharGrad outperforms existing text adversarial attacking approaches on attacking various subjects of generated images by black-box Text2Image models in a more effective and efficient way with less perturbation on the characters of the prompts",

To alleviate this problem, recent researchers build connections between support and query instances through embedding patch features to generate discriminative representations. However, we observe that there exists semantic mismatches (foreground/ background) among these local patches, because the location and size of the target object are not fixed. What is worse, these mismatches result in unreliable similarity confidences, and complex dense connection exacerbates the problem. According to this, we propose a novel Clustered-patch Element Connection (CEC) layer to correct the mismatch problem. The CEC layer leverages Patch Cluster and Element Connection operations to collect and establish reliable connections with high similarity patch features, respectively. Moreover, we propose a CECNet, including CEC layer based attention module and distance metric. The former is utilized to generate a more discriminative representation benefiting from the global clustered-patch features, and the latter is introduced to reliably measure the similarity between pair-features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CECNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on classification benchmark.

    "abstract": "Recently, MLP-based architectures achieved impressive results in image classification against CNNs and ViTs. However, there is an obvious limitation in that their parameters are related to image sizes, allowing them to process only fixed image sizes. Therefore, they cannot directly adapt dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) where images are of various sizes. Recent methods tried to address it but brought two new problems, long-range dependencies or important visual cues are ignored. This paper presents a new MLP-based architecture, Region-aware MLP (RaMLP), to satisfy various vision tasks and address the above three problems. In particular, we propose a well-designed module, Region-aware Mixing (RaM). RaM captures important local information and further aggregates these important visual clues. Based on RaM, RaMLP achieves a global receptive field even in one block. It is worth noting that, unlike most existing MLP-based architectures that adopt the same spatial weights to all samples, RaM is region-aware and adaptively determines weights to extract region-level features better. Impressively, our RaMLP outperforms state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs, and MLPs on both ImageNet-1K image classification and downstream dense prediction tasks, including MS-COCO object detection, MS-COCO instance segmentation, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. In particular, RaMLP outperforms MLPs by a large margin (around 1.5% Apb or 1.0% mIoU) on dense prediction tasks. The training code could be found at https://github.com/xiaolai-sqlai/RaMLP",

    "title": "Deep Unfolding Convolutional Dictionary Model for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-resolution and Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks often involve multiple contrasts. Recently, numerous deep learning-based multi-contrast MRI super-resolution (SR) and reconstruction methods have been proposed to explore the complementary information from the multi-contrast images. However, these methods either construct parameter-sharing networks or manually design fusion rules, failing to accurately model the correlations between multi-contrast images and lacking certain interpretations. In this paper, we propose a multi-contrast convolutional dictionary (MC-CDic) model under the guidance of the optimization algorithm with a well-designed data fidelity term. Specifically, we bulid an observation model for the multi-contrast MR images to explicitly model the multi-contrast images as common features and unique features. In this way, only the useful information in the reference image can be transferred to the target image, while the inconsistent information will be ignored. We employ the proximal gradient algorithm to optimize the model and unroll the iterative steps into a deep CDic model. Especially, the proximal operators are replaced by learnable ResNet. In addition, multi-scale dictionaries are introduced to further improve the model performance. We test our MC-CDic model on multi-contrast MRI SR and reconstruction tasks.

    "abstract": "The hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer are very popular for medical image segmentation. However, it suffers from two challenges. First, although a CNNs branch can capture the local image features using vanilla convolution, it cannot achieve adaptive feature learning. Second, although a Transformer branch can capture the global features, it ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention, resulting in a low segmentation accuracy on complex-content images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks hand in hand with vision Transformers (CiT-Net) for medical image segmentation. Our network has two advantages. First, we design a dynamic deformable convolution and apply it to the CNNs branch, which overcomes the weak feature extraction ability due to fixed-size convolution kernels and the stiff design of sharing kernel parameters among different inputs. Second, we design a shifted-window adaptive complementary attention module and a compact convolutional projection. We apply them to the Transformer branch to learn the cross-dimensional long-term dependency for medical images. Experimental results show that our CiT-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than popular SOTA methods. Besides, our CiT-Net requires lower parameters and less computational costs and does not rely on pre-training. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/SR0920/CiT-Net",

However, these approaches tend to integrate global information in a large searching region, which neglect to focus on the most relevant information and induce blurry effect by the irrelevant textures. Some improved methods simply constrain self-attention in a local window to suppress the useless information. But it also limits the capability of recovering high-frequency details when flat areas dominate the local searching window. To improve the above issues, we propose a novel self-refinement mechanism which could adaptively achieve texture-aware reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine procedure. Generally, the primary self-attention is first conducted to reconstruct the coarse-grained textures and detect the fine-grained regions required further compensation. Then, region selection attention is performed to refine the textures on these key regions. Since self-attention considers the channel information on tokens equally, we employ a dual-branch feature integration module to privilege the important channels in feature extraction. Furthermore, we design the wavelet fusion module which integrate shallow-layer structure and deep-layer detailed feature to recover realistic face images in frequency domain.

To tackle the challenge, we introduce an intermediate variable for grasp contact areas to constrain the grasp generation; in other words, we factorize the mapping into two sequential stages by assuming that grasping poses are fully constrained given contact maps: 1) we first learn contact map distributions to generate the potential contact maps for grasps; 2) then learn a mapping from the contact maps to the grasping poses.

Although deep learning (DL)-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved promising performance, most of them have a two-fold deficiency. For one thing, the universally adopted black box principle limits the model interpretability. For another thing, existing DL-based methods fail to efficiently capture local and global dependencies at the same time, inevitably limiting the overall performance. To address these mentioned issues, we first formulate the degradation process of the high-resolution multispectral (HrMS) image as a unified variational optimization problem, and alternately solve its data and prior subproblems by the designed iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm. Moreover, we customize a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) to simultaneously model local and global dependencies, and further formulate an LGT-based prior module for image denoising. Besides the prior module, we also design a lightweight data module. Finally, by serially integrating the data and prior modules in each iterative stage, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a stage-wise unfolding network, Local-Global Transformer Enhanced Unfolding Network (LGTEUN), for the interpretable MS pan-sharpening.

    "abstract": "Accurately perceiving instances and predicting their future motion are key tasks for autonomous vehicles, enabling them to navigate safely in complex urban traffic. While bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations are commonplace in perception for autonomous driving, their potential in a motion prediction setting is less explored. Existing approaches for BEV instance prediction from surround cameras rely on a multi-task auto-regressive setup coupled with complex post-processing to predict future instances in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. In this paper, we depart from this paradigm and propose an efficient novel end-to-end framework named PowerBEV, which differs in several design choices aimed at reducing the inherent redundancy in previous methods. First, rather than predicting the future in an auto-regressive fashion, PowerBEV uses a parallel, multi-scale module built from lightweight 2D convolutional networks. Second, we show that segmentation and centripetal backward flow are sufficient for prediction, simplifying previous multi-task objectives by eliminating redundant output modalities. Building on this output representation, we propose a simple, flow warping-based post-processing approach which produces more stable instance associations across time. Through this lightweight yet powerful design, PowerBEV outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the NuScenes Dataset and poses an alternative paradigm for BEV instance prediction.

    "abstract": "Pre-training has marked numerous state of the arts in high-level computer vision, while few attempts have ever been made to investigate how pre-training acts in image processing systems. In this paper, we tailor transformer-based pre-training regimes that boost various low-level tasks. To comprehensively diagnose the influence of pre-training, we design a whole set of principled evaluation tools that uncover its effects on internal representations. The observations demonstrate that pre-training plays strikingly different roles in low-level tasks. For example, pre-training introduces more local information to intermediate layers in super-resolution (SR), yielding significant performance gains, while pre-training hardly affects internal feature representations in denoising, resulting in limited gains. Further, we explore different methods of pre-training, revealing that multi-related-task pre-training is more effective and data-efficient than other alternatives. Finally, we extend our study to varying data scales and model sizes, as well as comparisons between transformers and CNNs. Based on the study, we successfully develop state-of-the-art models for multiple low-level tasks",

    "title": "Compositional Zero-Shot Artistic Font Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Recently, many researchers have made remarkable achievements in the field of artistic font synthesis, with impressive glyph style and effect style in the results. However, due to less exploration in style disentanglement, it is difficult for existing methods to envision a kind of unseen style (glyph-effect) compositions of artistic font, and thus can only learn the seen style compositions. To solve this problem, we propose a novel compositional zero-shot artistic font synthesis gan (CAFS-GAN), which allows the synthesis of unseen style compositions by exploring the visual independence and joint compatibility of encoding semantics between glyph and effect. Specifically, we propose two contrast-based style encoders to achieve style disentanglement due to glyph and effect intertwining in the image. Meanwhile, to preserve more glyph and effect detail, we propose a generator based on hierarchical dual styles AdaIN to reorganize content-styles representations from structure to texture gradually. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating high-quality artistic font images with unseen style compositions against other state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "VS-Boost: Boosting Visual-Semantic Association for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Unlike conventional zero-shot learning (CZSL) which only focuses on the recognition of unseen classes by using the classifier trained on seen classes and semantic embeddings, generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims at recognizing both the seen and unseen classes, so it is more challenging due to the extreme training imbalance. Recently, some feature generation methods introduce metric learning to enhance the discriminability of visual features. Although these methods achieve good results, they focus only on metric learning in the visual feature space to enhance features and ignore the association between the feature space and the semantic space. Since the GZSL method uses semantics as prior knowledge to migrate visual knowledge to unseen classes, the consistency between visual space and semantic space is critical. To this end, we propose relational metric learning which can relate the metrics in the two spaces and make the distribution of the two spaces more consistent. Based on the generation method and relational metric learning, we proposed a novel GZSL method, termed VS-Boost, which can effectively boost the association between vision and semantics. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective and achieves significant gains on five benchmark datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "SGAT4PASS: Spherical Geometry-Aware Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) gives complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Usually, prevalent PASS methods with 2D panoramic image input focus on solving image distortions but lack consideration of the 3D properties of original 360 degree data. Therefore, their performance will drop a lot when inputting panoramic images with the 3D disturbance. To be more robust to 3D disturbance, we propose our Spherical Geometry-Aware Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (SGAT4PASS), considering 3D spherical geometry knowledge. Specifically, a spherical geometry-aware framework is proposed for PASS. It includes three modules, i.e., spherical geometry-aware image projection, spherical deformable patch embedding, and a panorama-aware loss, which takes input images with 3D disturbance into account, adds a spherical geometry-aware constraint on the existing deformable patch embedding, and indicates the pixel density of original 360 degree data, respectively. Experimental results on Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets show that SGAT4PASS significantly improves performance and robustness, with approximately a 2% increase in mIoU, and when small 3D disturbances occur in the data, the stability of our performance is improved by an order of magnitude.

It always requires the source contents to be completely in front of the target contents or needs manual interventions to adjust occlusions, which is very tedious. Though several methods have suggested exploiting priors or learning techniques for promoting occlusion determination, their potentials are much limited. This paper addresses the challenge by presenting a depth registration method for merging the source contents seamlessly into the 3D space that the target image represents. Thus, the occlusions between the source contents and target contents can be conveniently handled through pixel-wise depth comparisons, allowing the user to more efficiently focus on the designs for image composition. Experimental results show that we can conveniently handle occlusions in image composition and improve efficiency by about 4 times compared to Photoshop",

    "title": "Complete Instances Mining for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) using only image-level labels is a challenging task due to the difficulty of aligning coarse annotations with the finer task. However, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), WSIS has garnered significant attention. Following a proposal-based paradigm, we encounter a redundant segmentation problem resulting from a single instance being represented by multiple proposals. For example, we feed a picture of a dog and proposals into the network and expect to output only one proposal containing a dog, but the network outputs multiple proposals. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for WSIS that focuses on the online refinement of complete instances through the use of MaskIoU heads to predict the integrity scores of proposals and a Complete Instances Mining (CIM) strategy to explicitly model the redundant segmentation problem and generate refined pseudo labels. Our approach allows the network to become aware of multiple instances and complete instances, and we further improve its robustness through the incorporation of an Anti-noise strategy. Empirical evaluations on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin.

    "title": "Analyzing and Combating Attribute Bias for Face Restoration",
    "abstract": "Face restoration (FR) recovers high resolution (HR) faces from low resolution (LR) faces and is challenging due to its ill-posed nature. With years of development, existing methods can produce quality HR faces with realistic details. However, we observe that key facial attributes (e.g., age and gender) of the restored faces could be dramatically different from the LR faces and call this phenomenon attribute bias, which is fatal when using FR for applications such as surveillance and security. Thus, we argue that FR should consider not only image quality as in existing works but also attribute bias. To this end, we thoroughly analyze attribute bias with extensive experiments and find that two major causes are the lack of attribute information in LR faces and bias in the training data. Moreover, we propose the DebiasFR framework to produce HR faces with high image quality and accurate facial attributes. The key design is to explicitly model the facial attributes, which also allows to adjust facial attributes for the output HR faces. Experiment results show that DebiasFR has comparable image quality but significantly smaller attribute bias when compared with state-of-the-art FR methods",

Specifically, we first graft a static scene graph generation model to generate static visual relationships within frames. Then we propose the temporal dependency model to extract the temporal dependencies across frames, and explicitly reassemble static visual relationships into dynamic scene graphs.

    "abstract": "Reliable pseudo labels from unlabeled data play a key role in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, the state-of-the-art SSOD methods all rely on pseudo labels with high confidence, which ignore valuable pseudo labels with lower confidence. Additionally, the insufficient excavation for unlabeled data results in an excessively low recall rate thus hurting the network training. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-confidence Samples Mining (LSM) method to utilize low confidence pseudo labels efficiently. Specifically, we develop an additional pseudo information mining (PIM) branch on account of low-resolution feature maps to extract reliable large area instances, the IoUs of which are higher than small area ones. Owing to the complementary predictions between PIM and the main branch, we further design self-distillation (SD) to compensate for both in a mutually learning manner. Meanwhile, the extensibility of the above approaches enables our LSM to apply to Faster-RCNN and Deformable-DETR respectively. On the MS-COCO benchmark, our method achieves 3.54% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art methods under 5% labeling ratios",

    "abstract": "Decision-based methods have shown to be effective in black-box adversarial attacks, as they can obtain satisfactory performance and only require to access the final model prediction. Gradient estimation is a critical step in black-box adversarial attacks, as it will directly affect the query efficiency. Recent works have attempted to utilize gradient priors to facilitate score-based methods to obtain better results. However, these gradient priors still suffer from the edge gradient discrepancy issue and the successive iteration gradient direction issue, thus are difficult to simply extend to decision-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Decision-based Black-box Attack framework with Gradient Priors (DBA-GP), which seamlessly integrates the data-dependent gradient prior and time-dependent prior into the gradient estimation procedure. First, by leveraging the joint bilateral filter to deal with each random perturbation, DBA-GP can guarantee that the generated perturbations in edge locations are hardly smoothed, i.e., alleviating the edge gradient discrepancy, thus remaining the characteristics of the original image as much as possible. Second, by utilizing a new gradient updating strategy to automatically adjust the successive iteration gradient direction, DBA-GP can accelerate the convergence speed, thus improving the query efficiency.

    "abstract": "For many driving safety applications, it is of great importance to accurately register LiDAR point clouds generated on distant moving vehicles. However, such point clouds have extremely different point density and sensor perspective on the same object, making registration on such point clouds very hard. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction framework, called APR, for online distant point cloud registration. Specifically, APR leverages an autoencoder design, where the autoencoder reconstructs a denser aggregated point cloud with several frames instead of the original single input point cloud. Our design forces the encoder to extract features with rich local geometry information based on one single input point cloud. Such features are then used for online distant point cloud registration. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art (SOTA) feature extractors on KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Results show that APR outperforms all other extractors by a large margin, increasing average registration recall of SOTA extractors by 7.1% on LoKITTI and 4.6% on LoNuScenes.

    "title": "Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition via Disentangling Identity Representation",
    "abstract": "Most existing cross-domain facial expression recognition (FER) works require target domain data to assist the model in analyzing distribution shifts to overcome negative effects. However, it is often hard to obtain expression images of the target domain in practical applications. Moreover, existing methods suffer from the interference of identity information, thus limiting the discriminative ability of the expression features. We exploit the idea of domain generalization (DG) and propose a representation disentanglement model to address the above problems. Specifically, we learn three independent potential subspaces corresponding to the domain, expression, and identity information from facial images. Meanwhile, the extracted expression and identity features are recovered as Fourier phase information reconstructed images, thereby ensuring that the high-level semantics of images remain unchanged after disentangling the domain information. Our proposed method can disentangle expression features from expression-irrelevant ones (i.e., identity and domain features). Therefore, the learned expression features exhibit sufficient domain invariance and discriminative ability. We conduct experiments with different settings on multiple benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention",
    "abstract": "Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods",

    "abstract": "Object detection on panoramic/spherical images has been developed rapidly in the past few years, where IoU-calculator is a fundamental part of various detector components, i.e. Label Assignment, Loss and NMS. Due to the low efficiency and non-differentiability of spherical Unbiased IoU, spherical approximate IoU methods have been proposed recently. We find that the key of these approximate methods is to map spherical boxes to planar boxes. However, there exists two problems in these methods: (1) they do not eliminate the influence of panoramic image distortion; (2) they break the original pose between bounding boxes. They lead to the low accuracy of these methods. Taking the two problems into account, we propose a new sphere-plane boxes transform, called Sph2Pob. Based on the Sph2Pob, we propose (1) an differentiable IoU, Sph2Pob-IoU, for spherical boxes with low time-cost and high accuracy and (2) an agent Loss, Sph2Pob-Loss, for spherical detection with high flexibility and expansibility.

    "title": "Semantic-Aware Generation of Multi-View Portrait Drawings",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) based methods have shown amazing performance in synthesizing 3D-consistent photographic images, but fail to generate multi-view portrait drawings. The key is that the basic assumption of these methods -- a surface point is consistent when rendered from different views -- doesn't hold for drawings. In a portrait drawing, the appearance of a facial point may changes when viewed from different angles. Besides, portrait drawings usually present little 3D information and suffer from insufficient training data. To combat this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware GEnerator (SAGE) for synthesizing multi-view portrait drawings. Our motivation is that facial semantic labels are view-consistent and correlate with drawing techniques. We therefore propose to collaboratively synthesize multi-view semantic maps and the corresponding portrait drawings. To facilitate training, we design a semantic-aware domain translator, which generates portrait drawings based on features of photographic faces. In addition, use data augmentation via synthesis to mitigate collapsed results. We apply SAGE to synthesize multi-view portrait drawings in diverse artistic styles. Experimental results show that SAGE achieves significantly superior or highly competitive performance, compared to existing 3D-aware image synthesis methods.

    "title": "Dual Relation Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective method for model compression. However, it is still a challenging topic to apply knowledge distillation to detection tasks. There are two key points resulting in poor distillation performance for detection tasks. One is the serious imbalance between foreground and background features, another one is that small object lacks enough feature representation. To solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual relation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation distillation and instance-wise relation distillation. The pixel-wise relation distillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph convolution to capture the global pixel relation. By distilling the global pixel relation, the student detector can learn the relation between foreground and background features, and avoid the difficulty of distilling features directly for the feature imbalance issue. Besides, we find that instance-wise relation supplements valuable knowledge beyond independent features for small objects. Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which calculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix. More importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable instance relations. The proposed dual relation knowledge distillation is general and can be easily applied for both one-stage and two-stage detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, which improves Faster R-CNN based on ResNet50 from 38.4% to 41.6% mAP and improves RetinaNet based on ResNet50 from 37.4% to 40.3% mAP on COCO 2017",

It synchronizes 3D proposal generation and center-ness score prediction by a parallel predictor without tedious hyper-parameters. To guide a task-aligned score ranking of proposals, a center-aware focal loss is proposed to supervise the training of the center-ness branch, which enhances the network's discriminative ability to distinguish proposals of different quality. Besides, we design a binary target classifier to identify target-relevant points. By integrating the derived classification scores with the center-ness scores, the resulting network can effectively suppress interference proposals and further mitigate task misalignment. Finally, we present a novel one-stage Siamese tracker OSP2B equipped with the designed network. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks including KITTI and Waymo SOT Dataset show that our OSP2B achieves leading performance with a considerable real-time speed",

    "title": "SLViT: Scale-Wise Language-Guided Vision Transformer for Referring Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims to segment an object out of an image via a specific language expression. The main concept is establishing global visual-linguistic relationships to locate the object and identify boundaries using details of the image. Recently, various Transformer-based techniques have been proposed to efficiently leverage long-range cross-modal dependencies,  enhancing performance for referring segmentation. However, existing methods consider visual feature extraction and cross-modal fusion separately, resulting in insufficient visual-linguistic alignment in semantic space. In addition, they employ sequential structures and hence lack multi-scale information interaction. To address these limitations, we propose a Scale-Wise Language-Guided Vision Transformer (SLViT) with two appealing designs: (1) Language-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion Attention, a novel attention mechanism module for extracting rich local visual information and modeling global visual-linguistic relationships in an integrated manner. (2) An Uncertain Region Cross-Scale Enhancement module that can identify regions of high uncertainty using linguistic features and refine them via aggregated multi-scale features. We have evaluated our method on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that SLViT surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.

    "abstract": "We study visual question answering in a setting where the answer has to be mined from a pool of relevant and irrelevant images given as a context. For such a setting, a model must first retrieve relevant images from the pool and answer the question from these retrieved images. We refer to this problem as retrieval-based visual question answering (or RETVQA in short). The RETVQA is distinctively different and more challenging than the traditionally-studied Visual Question Answering (VQA), where a given question has to be answered with a single relevant image in context. Towards solving the RETVQA task, we propose a unified Multi Image BART (MI-BART) that takes a question and retrieved images using our relevance encoder for free-form fluent answer generation. Further, we introduce the largest dataset in this space, namely RETVQA, which has the following salient features: multi-image and retrieval requirement for VQA, metadata-independent questions over a pool of heterogeneous images, expecting a mix of classification-oriented and open-ended generative answers. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76.5% and a fluency of 79.3% on the proposed dataset, namely RETVQA and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.9% and 11.8% on the image segment of the publicly available WebQA dataset on the accuracy and fluency metrics, respectively",

    "abstract": "Multi-camera instance association, which identifies identical objects among multiple objects in multi-view images, is challenging due to several harsh constraints. To tackle this problem, most studies have employed CNNs as feature extractors but often fail under such harsh constraints. Inspired by Vision Transformer (ViT), we first develop a pure ViT-based framework for robust feature extraction through self-attention and residual connection. We then propose two novel methods to achieve robust feature learning. First, we introduce learnable pseudo 3D position embeddings (P3DEs) that represent the 3D location of an object in the world coordinate system, which is independent of the harsh constraints. To generate P3DEs, we encode the camera ID and the object's 2D position in the image using embedding tables. We then build a framework that trains P3DEs to represent an object's 3D position in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we also utilize joint patch generation (JPG). During patch generation, JPG considers an object and its surroundings as a single input patch to reinforce the relationship information between two features. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate that both ViT-P3DE and ViT-P3DE with JPG achieve state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperform existing works, especially when dealing with extremely harsh constraints",

This gives the student the best assistance in making up for his (or her) weaknesses and becoming a good one overall. Enlightened by this, we introduce the \"Teaching what you Should Teach\" strategy into a knowledge distillation framework, and propose a data-based distillation method named \"TST\" that searches for desirable augmented samples to assist in distilling more efficiently and rationally. To be specific, we design a neural network-based data augmentation module with priori bias to find out what meets the teacher's strengths but the student's weaknesses, by learning magnitudes and probabilities to generate suitable data samples. By training the data augmentation module and the generalized distillation paradigm alternately, a student model is learned with excellent generalization ability. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive comparative experiments on object recognition, detection, and segmentation tasks. The results on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, MS-COCO, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all teacher-student pairs.

    "abstract": "The problem of long-tailed recognition (LTR) has received attention in recent years due to the fundamental power-law distribution of objects in the real-world. Most recent works in LTR use softmax classifiers that are biased in that they correlate classifier norm with the amount of training data for a given class. In this work, we show that learning prototype classifiers addresses the biased softmax problem in LTR. Prototype classifiers can deliver promising results simply using Nearest-Class-Mean (NCM), a special case where prototypes are empirical centroids. We go one step further and propose to jointly learn prototypes by using distances to prototypes in representation space as the logit scores for classification. Further, we theoretically analyze the properties of Euclidean distance based prototype classifiers that lead to stable gradient-based optimization which is robust to outliers. To enable independent distance scales along each channel, we enhance Prototype classifiers by learning channel-dependent temperature parameters. Our analysis shows that prototypes learned by Prototype classifiers are better separated than empirical centroids. Results on four LTR benchmarks show that Prototype classifier outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advanced Table Structure Recognition (TSR) models adopt image-to-text solutions to parse table structure. These methods can be formulated as image caption problem, i.e., input a single-table image and output table structure description in a specific text format, e.g., HTML. With the impressive success of Transformer in text generation tasks, these methods use Transformer architecture to predict HTML table text in an autoregressive manner. However, tables always emerge with a large variety of shapes and sizes. Autoregressive models usually suffer from the error accumulation problem as the length of predicted text increases, which results in unsatisfactory performance for large tables. In this paper, we propose a novel image-to-text based TSR method that relieves error accumulation problems and improves performance noticeably. At the core of our method is a cascaded two-step decoder architecture with the former decoder predicting HTML table row tags non-autoregressively and the latter predicting HTML table cell tags of each row in a semi-autoregressive manner. Compared with existing methods that predict HTML text autoregressively, the superiority of our row-to-cell progressive table parsing is twofold: (1) it generates an HTML tag sequence with a vertical-and-horizontal two-step `scanning', which better fits the inherent 2D structure of image data, (2) it performs substantially better for large tables (long sequence prediction) since it alleviates error accumulation problem specific to autoregressive models.

    "abstract": "The conventional lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) claims that there exists a sparse subnetwork within a dense neural network and a proper random initialization method, called the winning ticket, such that it can be trained from scratch to almost as good as the dense counterpart. Meanwhile, the research of LTH in vision transformers (ViTs) is scarcely evaluated. In this paper, we first show that the conventional winning ticket is hard to find at weight level of ViTs by existing methods. Then, we generalize the LTH for ViTs to input data consisting of image patches inspired by the input dependence of ViTs. That is, there exists a subset of input image patches such that a ViT can be trained from scratch by using only this subset of patches and achieve similar accuracy to the ViTs trained by using all image patches. We call this subset of input patches the winning tickets, which represent a significant amount of information in the input data. We use a ticket selector to generate the winning tickets based on the informativeness of patches for various types of ViT, including DeiT, LV-ViT, and Swin Transformers. The experiments show that there is a clear difference between the performance of models trained with winning tickets and randomly selected subsets, which verifies our proposed theory. We elaborate the analogical similarity between our proposed Data-LTH-ViTs and the conventional LTH for further verifying the integrity of our theory.

Specifically, we first propose a Discrepancy-Guided Encoder (DisGE) to extract forgery-sensitive visual patterns.

Besides, a Double-Head Reconstruction (DouHR) module is proposed to enhance genuine compact visual patterns in different granular spaces. Under DouHR, we further introduce a Discrepancy-Aggregation Detector (DisAD) to aggregate these genuine compact visual patterns, such that the forgery detection capability on unknown patterns can be improved.

To overcome the limitation, deep neural networks rely on various visual hints such as size, shade, and texture extracted from RGB information. However, we observe that if such hints are overly exploited, the network can be biased on RGB information without considering the comprehensive view. We propose a novel depth estimation model named RElative Depth Transformer (RED-T) that uses relative depth as guidance in self-attention. Specifically, the model assigns high attention weights to pixels of close depth and low attention weights to pixels of distant depth. As a result, the features of similar depth can become more likely to each other and thus less prone to misused visual hints. We show that the proposed model achieves competitive results in monocular depth estimation benchmarks and is less biased to RGB information. In addition, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation benchmark that limits the observable depth range during training in order to evaluate the robustness of the model for unseen depths",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has shown great success in novel view synthesis due to its state-of-the-art quality and flexibility. However, NeRF requires dense input views (tens to hundreds) and a long training time (hours to days) for a single scene to generate high-fidelity images. Although using the voxel grids to represent the radiance field can significantly accelerate the optimization process, we observe that for sparse inputs, the voxel grids are more prone to overfitting to the training views and will have holes and floaters, which leads to artifacts. In this paper, we propose VGOS, an approach for fast (3-5 minutes) radiance field reconstruction from sparse inputs (3-10 views) to address these issues. To improve the performance of voxel-based radiance field in sparse input scenarios, we propose two methods: (a) We introduce an incremental voxel training strategy, which prevents overfitting by suppressing the optimization of peripheral voxels in the early stage of reconstruction. (b) We use several regularization techniques to smooth the voxels, which avoids degenerate solutions.

    "abstract": "Neural connectivity reconstruction aims to understand the function of biological reconstruction and promote basic scientific research. The intricate morphology and densely intertwined branches make it an extremely challenging task. Most previous best-performing methods adopt affinity learning or metric learning. Nevertheless, they either neglect to model explicit voxel semantics caused by implicit optimization or are hysteresis to spatial information. Furthermore, the inherent locality of 3D CNNs limits modeling long-range dependencies, leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a coherent and unified Appearance Prompt Vision Transformer (APViT) to integrate affinity and metric learning to exploit the complementarity by learning long-range spatial dependencies. The proposed APViT enjoys several merits. First, the extension continuity-aware attention module aims at constructing hierarchical attention customized for neuron extensibility and slice continuity to learn instance voxel semantic context from a global perspective and utilize continuity priors to enhance voxel spatial awareness. Second, the appearance prompt modulator is responsible for leveraging voxel-adaptive appearance knowledge conditioned on affinity rich in spatial information to instruct instance voxel semantics, exploiting the potential of affinity learning to complement metric learning. Extensive experimental results on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our APViT achieves consistent improvements with huge flexibility under the same post-processing strategy",

    "abstract": "Reliable outlier detection is critical for real-world deployment of deep learning models. Although extensively studied, likelihoods produced by deep generative models have been largely dismissed as being impractical for outlier detection. First, deep generative model likelihoods are readily biased by low-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for correcting these biases are computationally expensive, or do not generalize well to complex, natural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a state-of-the-art deep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++. We show that biases in PixelCNN++ likelihoods arise primarily from predictions based on local dependencies. We propose two families of bijective transformations -- ``stirring'' and ``shaking'' -- which ameliorate low-level biases and isolate the contribution of long-range dependencies to PixelCNN++ likelihoods. These transformations are inexpensive and readily computed at evaluation time. We test our approaches extensively with five grayscale and six natural image datasets and show that they achieve or exceed state-of-the-art outlier detection, particularly on datasets with complex, natural images. We also show that our solutions work well with other types of generative models (generative flows and variational autoencoders) and that their efficacy is governed by each model's reliance on local dependencies.

Most existing approaches focus on the spatial-temporal neural network model design for learning movement patterns to reduce prediction errors. However, they usually do not strictly follow the temporal constraints in the inference stage. Even though a small Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) is achieved, some of the predicted poses are not temporal feasible solutions, which disobeys the continuity of the body movement. In this paper, we consider the temporal constrained feasible solutions for human pose forecasting, where the predicted poses of input historical poses are guaranteed to obey the temporal constraints strictly in the inference stage. Rather than direct supervision of the prediction in the original pose space, a temporal constrained subspace is explicitly learned and then followed by an inverse transformation to obtain the final predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale benchmarks, including Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW. State-of-the-art performance has been achieved with the temporal constrained feasible solutions",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for learning calibrated uncertainties under domain shifts, considering the case where the source (training) distribution differs from the target (test) distribution. We detect such domain shifts through the use of a differentiable density ratio estimator and train it together with the task network, composing an adjusted softmax predictive form that concerns the domain shift. In particular, the density ratio estimator yields a density ratio that reflects the closeness of a target (test) sample to the source (training) distribution. We employ it to adjust the uncertainty of prediction in the task network. This idea of using the density ratio is based on the distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework, which accounts for the domain shift through adversarial risk minimization. We demonstrate that our proposed method generates calibrated uncertainties that benefit many downstream tasks, such as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). On these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncertainties to select confident pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show that the introduction of DRL leads to significant improvements in cross-domain performance.

Specifically, we set up three hierarchical embedding spaces that respectively model the states, the objects, and their compositions, which serve as three “experts” that can be combined in inference for more accurate predictions. We achieve this based on the recent success of large-scale pretrained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, which provides a strong initial knowledge of image-text relationships. To better adapt this knowledge to CZSL, we propose to learn three hierarchical prompts by explicitly fixing the unrelated word tokens in the three embedding spaces.

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a realistic but challenging task that requires an agent to locate the target region using verbal and visual cues. While significant advancements have been achieved recently, there are still two broad limitations: (1) The explicit information mining for significant guiding semantics concealed in both vision and language is still under-explored; (2) The previously structured map method provides the average historical appearance of visited nodes, while it ignores distinctive contributions of various images and potent information retention in the reasoning process. This work proposes a dual semantic-aware recurrent global-adaptive network (DSRG) to address the above problems. First, DSRG proposes an instruction-guidance linguistic module (IGL) and an appearance-semantics visual module (ASV) for boosting vision and language semantic learning respectively. For the memory mechanism, a global adaptive aggregation module (GAA) is devised for explicit panoramic observation fusion, and a recurrent memory fusion module (RMF) is introduced to supply implicit temporal hidden states. Extensive experimental results on the R2R and REVERIE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing methods.

    "title": "Detecting Adversarial Faces Using Only Real Face Self-Perturbations",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks aim to disturb the functionality of a target system by adding specific noise to the input samples, bringing potential threats to security and robustness when applied to facial recognition systems. Although existing defense techniques achieve high accuracy in detecting some specific adversarial faces (adv-faces), new attack methods especially GAN-based attacks with completely different noise patterns circumvent them and reach a higher attack success rate. Even worse, existing techniques require attack data before implementing the defense, making it impractical to defend newly emerging attacks that are unseen to defenders. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic generality of adv-faces and propose to generate pseudo adv-faces by perturbing real faces with three heuristically designed noise patterns. We are the first to train an adv-face detector using only real faces and their self-perturbations, agnostic to victim facial recognition systems, and agnostic to unseen attacks. By regarding adv-faces as out-of-distribution data, we then naturally introduce a novel cascaded system for adv-face detection, which consists of training data self-perturbations, decision boundary regularization, and a max-pooling-based binary classifier focusing on abnormal local color aberrations. Experiments conducted on LFW and CelebA-HQ datasets with eight gradient-based and two GAN-based attacks validate that our method generalizes to a variety of unseen adversarial attacks",

    "title": "Align, Perturb and Decouple: Toward Better Leverage of Difference Information for RSI Change Detection",
    "abstract": "Change detection is a widely adopted technique in remote sense imagery (RSI) analysis in the discovery of long-term geomorphic evolution. To highlight the areas of semantic changes, previous effort mostly pays attention to learning representative feature descriptors of a single image, while the difference information is either modeled with simple difference operations or implicitly embedded via feature interactions. Nevertheless, such difference modeling can be noisy since it suffers from non-semantic changes and lacks explicit guidance from image content or context. In this paper, we revisit the importance of feature difference for change detection in RSI, and propose a series of operations to fully exploit the difference information: Alignment, Perturbation and Decoupling (APD). Firstly, alignment leverages contextual similarity to compensate for the non-semantic difference in feature space. Next, a difference module trained with semantic-wise perturbation is adopted to learn more generalized change estimators, which reversely bootstraps feature extraction and prediction. Finally, a decoupled dual-decoder structure is designed to predict semantic changes in both content-aware and content-agnostic manners. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks of LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD and DSIFN-CD, demonstrating our proposed operations bring significant improvement and achieve competitive results under similar comparative conditions.

    "title": "Learning 3D Photography Videos via Self-supervised Diffusion on Single Images",
    "abstract": "3D photography renders a static image into a video with appealing 3D visual effects. Existing approaches typically first conduct monocular depth estimation, then render the input frame to subsequent frames with various viewpoints, and finally use an inpainting model to fill those missing/occluded regions. The inpainting model plays a crucial role in rendering quality, but it is normally trained on out-of-domain data. To reduce the training and inference gap, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion model as the inpainting module. Given a single input image, we automatically construct a training pair of the masked occluded image and the ground-truth image with random cycle rendering. The constructed training samples are closely aligned to the testing instances, without the need for data annotation. To make full use of the masked images, we designed a Masked Enhanced Block (MEB), which can be easily plugged into the UNet and enhance the semantic conditions. Towards real-world animation, we present a novel task: out-animation, which extends the space and time of input objects. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves competitive results with existing SOTA methods",

    "title": "Dual-view Correlation Hybrid Attention Network for Robust Holistic Mammogram Classification",
    "abstract": "Mammogram image is important for breast cancer screening, and typically obtained in a dual-view form, i.e., cranio-caudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO), to provide complementary information for clinical decisions. However, previous methods mostly learn features from the two views independently, which violates the clinical knowledge and ignores the importance of dual-view correlation in the feature learning. In this paper, we propose a dual-view correlation hybrid attention network (DCHA-Net) for robust holistic mammogram classification. Specifically, DCHA-Net is carefully designed to extract and reinvent deep feature maps for the two views, and meanwhile to maximize the underlying correlations between them. A hybrid attention module, consisting of local relation and non-local attention blocks, is proposed to alleviate the spatial misalignment of the paired views in the correlation maximization. A dual-view correlation loss is introduced to maximize the feature similarity between corresponding strip-like regions with equal distance to the chest wall, motivated by the fact that their features represent the same breast tissues, and thus should be highly-correlated with each other. Experimental results on the two public datasets, i.e., INbreast and CBIS-DDSM, demonstrate that the DCHA-Net can well preserve and maximize feature correlations across views, and thus outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for classifying a whole mammogram as malignant or not",

    "title": "Accurate MRI Reconstruction via Multi-Domain Recurrent Networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become dominant in MRI reconstruction from undersampled k-space. However, most existing CNNs methods reconstruct the undersampled images either in the spatial domain or in the frequency domain, and neglecting the correlation between these two domains. This hinders the further reconstruction performance improvement. To tackle this issue, in this work, we propose a new multi-domain recurrent network (MDR-Net) with multi-domain learning (MDL) blocks as its basic units to reconstruct the undersampled MR image progressively. Specifically, the MDL block interactively processes the local spatial features and the global frequency information to facilitate complementary learning, leading to fine-grained features generation. Furthermore, we introduce an effective frequency-based loss to narrow the frequency spectrum gap, compensating for over-smoothness caused by the widely used spatial reconstruction loss. Extensive experiments on public fastMRI datasets demonstrate that our MDR-Net consistently outperforms other competitive methods and is able to provide more details",

    "title": "From Generation to Suppression: Towards Effective Irregular Glow Removal for Nighttime Visibility Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Most existing Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods are primarily designed to improve brightness in dark regions, which suffer from severe degradation in nighttime images. However, these methods have limited exploration in another major visibility damage, the glow effects in real night scenes. Glow effects are inevitable in the presence of artificial light sources and cause further diffused blurring when directly enhanced. To settle this issue, we innovatively consider the glow suppression task as learning physical glow generation via multiple scattering estimation according to the Atmospheric Point Spread Function (APSF). In response to the challenges posed by uneven glow intensity and varying source shapes, an APSF-based Nighttime Imaging Model with Near-field Light Sources (NIM-NLS) is specifically derived to design a scalable Light-aware Blind Deconvolution Network (LBDN). The glow-suppressed result is then brightened via a Retinex-based Enhancement Module (REM). Remarkably, the proposed glow suppression method is based on zero-shot learning and does not rely on any paired or unpaired training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both glow suppression and low-light enhancement tasks",

    "title": "Hierarchical Semantic Contrast for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level annotations has achieved great processes through class activation map (CAM). Since vanilla CAMs are hardly served as guidance to bridge the gap between full and weak supervision, recent studies explore semantic representations to make CAM fit for WSSS and demonstrate encouraging results. However, they generally exploit single-level semantics, which may hamper the model to learn a comprehensive semantic structure. Motivated by the prior that each image has multiple levels of semantics, we propose hierarchical semantic contrast (HSC) to ameliorate the above problem. It conducts semantic contrast from coarse-grained to fine-grained perspective, including ROI level, class level, and pixel level, making the model learn a better object pattern understanding. To further improve CAM quality, building upon HSC, we explore consistency regularization of cross supervision and develop momentum prototype learning to utilize abundant semantics across different images. Extensive studies manifest that our plug-and-play learning paradigm, HSC, can significantly boost CAM quality on both non-saliency-guided and saliency-guided baselines, and establish new state-of-the-art WSSS performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

    "title": "Learning Monocular Depth in Dynamic Environment via Context-aware Temporal Attention",
    "abstract": "The monocular depth estimation task has recently revealed encouraging prospects, especially for the autonomous driving task. To tackle the ill-posed problem of 3D geometric reasoning from 2D monocular images, multi-frame monocular methods are developed to leverage the perspective correlation information from sequential temporal frames. However, moving objects such as cars and trains usually violate the static scene assumption, leading to feature inconsistency deviation and misaligned cost values, which would mislead the optimization algorithm. In this work, we present CTA-Depth, a Context-aware Temporal Attention guided network for multi-frame monocular Depth estimation. Specifically, we first apply a multi-level attention enhancement module to integrate multi-level image features to obtain an initial depth and pose estimation. Then the proposed CTA-Refiner is adopted to alternatively optimize the depth and pose. During the CTA-Refiner process, context-aware temporal attention (CTA) is developed to capture the global temporal-context correlations to maintain the feature consistency and estimation integrity of moving objects. In particular, we propose a long-range geometry embedding (LGE) module to produce a long-range temporal geometry prior. Our approach achieves significant improvements (e.g., 13.5% for the Abs Rel metric on the KITTI dataset) over state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising has achieved promising results with the development of deep learning. A mainstream class of methods exploits the spatial-spectral correlations and recovers each band with the aids of neighboring bands, collectively referred to as spectral auxiliary networks. However, these methods treat entire adjacent spectral bands equally. In theory, clearer and nearer bands  tend to contain more reliable spectral information than noisier and farther ones with higher uncertainties. How to achieve spectral enhancement and adaptation of each adjacent band has become an urgent problem in HSI denoising. This work presents the UA-Adjustor, a comprehensive adjustor that enhances denoising performance by considering both the band-to-pixel and enhancement-to-adjustment aspects. Specifically, UA-Adjustor consists of three stages that evaluate the importance of neighboring bands, enhance neighboring bands based on uncertainty perception, and adjust the weight of spatial pixels in adjacent bands through estimated uncertainty. For its simplicity, UA-Adjustor can be flexibly plugged into existing spectral auxiliary networks to improve denoising behavior at low cost. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed solution can improve over recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both simulated and real-world benchmarks by a large margin",

It is based on patch embeddings, rather than attentions paid to them, and their causal impacts on the model output. Other characteristics of ViTs such as causal overdetermination are considered in the design of ViT-CX. The empirical results show that ViT-CX produces more meaningful saliency maps and does a better job revealing all important evidence for the predictions than previous methods.

In this paper, we establish a multimodal-driven variational autoencoder (mmVAE) framework to perform 3D surface enhancement based on 2D normal images. To fully leverage the multimodal learning, we investigate a multimodal Gaussian mixture model (mmGMM) to align and fuse the latent feature representations from different modalities, and further propose a cross-scale encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct high-resolution normal images.

    "title": "Diagnose Like a Pathologist: Transformer-Enabled Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and transformers are increasingly popular in histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, unlike human pathologists who selectively observe specific regions of histopathology tissues under different magnifications, most methods do not incorporate multiple resolutions of the WSIs, hierarchically and attentively, thereby leading to a loss of focus on the WSIs and information from other resolutions. To resolve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs. This framework can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs. Within this framework, an Integrated Attention Transformer is proposed to further enhance the performance of the transformer and obtain a more holistic WSI (bag) representation. This transformer consists of multiple Integrated Attention Modules, which is the combination of a transformer layer and an aggregation module that produces a bag representation based on every instance representation in that bag.

In this work, we design a novel data augmentation strategy called ``Universal Adaptive Data Augmentation\" (UADA). Different from existing methods, UADA would adaptively update DA's parameters according to the target model's gradient information during training: given a pre-defined set of DA operations, we randomly decide types and magnitudes of DA operations for every data batch during training, and adaptively update DA's parameters along the gradient direction of the loss concerning DA's parameters. In this way, UADA can increase the training loss of the target networks, and the target networks would learn features from harder samples to improve the generalization. Moreover, UADA is very general and can be utilized in numerous tasks, e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection.

Our new benchmark (VIPOSeg) contains exhaustive object annotations and covers various real-world object categories which are carefully divided into subsets of thing/stuff and seen/unseen classes for comprehensive evaluation. Considering the challenges in panoptic VOS, we propose a strong baseline method named panoptic object association with transformers (PAOT), which associates multiple objects by panoptic identification in a pyramid architecture on multiple scales. Experimental results show that VIPOSeg can not only boost the performance of VOS models by panoptic training but also evaluate them comprehensively in panoptic scenes.

    "abstract": "Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), one of the standard intelligence tests in human psychology, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for studying abstract visual reasoning (AVR) abilities in machines. Although existing computational models for RPM problems achieve good performance, they require a large number of labeled training examples for supervised learning. In contrast, humans can efficiently solve unlabeled RPM problems after learning from only a few example questions. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method, called RuleMatch, to train deep models with a small number of labeled RPM questions along with other unlabeled questions. Moreover, instead of using pixel-level augmentation in object perception tasks, we exploit the nature of RPM problems and augment the data at the level of abstract rules. Specifically, we disrupt the possible rules contained among context images in an RPM question and force the two augmented variants of the same unlabeled sample to obey the same abstract rule and predict a common pseudo label for training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed RuleMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular RAVEN datasets.

Following this principle, a novel method named Ensemble Learning with Multi-Order Statistics (ELMOS) is proposed in this paper. In this method, after the backbone network, we use multiple branches to create the individual learners in the ensemble learning, with the goal to reduce the storage cost. We then introduce different order statistics pooling in each branch to increase the diversity of the individual learners.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in video synthesis tasks including prediction, generation, and interpolation. Due to the limitation of the computational budget, existing methods usually implement conditional diffusion models with an autoregressive inference pipeline, in which the future fragment is predicted based on the distribution of adjacent past frames. However, only the conditions from a few previous frames can't capture the global temporal coherence, leading to inconsistent or even outrageous results in long-term video prediction. In this paper, we propose a Local-Global Context guided Video Diffusion model (LGC-VD) to capture multi-perception conditions for producing high-quality videos in both conditional/unconditional settings. In LGC-VD, the UNet is implemented with stacked residual blocks with self-attention units, avoiding the undesirable computational cost in 3D Conv. We construct a local-global context guidance strategy to capture the multi-perceptual embedding of the past fragment to boost the consistency of future prediction. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training strategy to alleviate the effect of noisy frames for more stable predictions.

Unfortunately, existing methods based on pseudo-label learning suffer from the changing target domain environment, and the quality of generated pseudo-labels is attenuated due to the domain shift, leading to instantaneous negative learning and long-term knowledge forgetting. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for exploring safety supervision with three elaborate strategies: Label Safety, Sample Safety, and Parameter Safety. Firstly, to select reliable pseudo-labels, we define and adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the test-time learning status. Secondly, a soft-weighted contrastive learning module is presented to explore the highly-correlated samples and discriminate uncorrelated ones, improving the instantaneous efficiency of the model. Finally, we frame a Soft Weight Alignment strategy to normalize the distance between the parameters of the adapted model and the source pre-trained model, which alleviates the long-term problem of knowledge forgetting and significantly improves the accuracy of the adapted model in the late adaptation stage.

The task is challenging due to the high dimensionality nature of an action, as well as the subtle motion details to be considered. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically learn from articulated motion sequences in the straightforward 3D Euclidean space. However, the vanilla Euclidean space is not efficient for modeling important motion characteristics such as the joint-wise angular acceleration, which reveals the driving force behind the motion. Moreover, current methods typically attend to each channel equally and lack theoretical constrains on extracting task-relevant features from the input. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose to incorporate an acceleration representation, explicitly modeling the higher-order variations in motion. (2) We introduce a novel Stream-GCN network equipped with multi-stream components and channel attention, where different representations (i.e., streams) supplement each other towards a more precise action recognition while attention capitalizes on those important channels. (3) We explore feature-level supervision for maximizing the extraction of task-relevant information and formulate this into a mutual information loss. Empirically, our approach sets the new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA",

    "title": "Orientation-Independent Chinese Text Recognition in Scene Images",
    "abstract": "Scene text recognition (STR) has attracted much attention due to its broad applications. The previous works pay more attention to dealing with the recognition of Latin text images with complex backgrounds by introducing language models or other auxiliary networks. Different from Latin texts, many vertical Chinese texts exist in natural scenes, which brings difficulties to current state-of-the-art STR methods. In this paper, we take the first attempt to extract orientation-independent visual features by disentangling content and orientation information of text images, thus recognizing both horizontal and vertical texts robustly in natural scenes. Specifically, we introduce a Character Image Reconstruction Network (CIRN) to recover corresponding printed character images with disentangled content and orientation information. We conduct experiments on a scene dataset for benchmarking Chinese text recognition, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can indeed improve performance through disentangling content and orientation information. To further validate the effectiveness of our method, we additionally collect a Vertical Chinese Text Recognition (VCTR) dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 45.63\\% improvement on VCTR when introducing CIRN to the baseline model",

    "title": "Actor-Multi-Scale Context Bidirectional Higher Order Interactive Relation Network for Spatial-Temporal Action Localization",
    "abstract": "The key to video action detection lies in the understanding of interaction between persons and background objects in a video. Current methods usually employ object detectors to extract objects directly or use grid features to represent objects in the environment, which underestimate the great potential of multi-scale context information (e.g., objects and scenes of different sizes). How to exactly represent the multi-scale context and make full utilization of it still remains an unresolved challenge for spatial-temporal action localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Actor-Multi-Scale Context Bidirectional Higher Order Interactive Relation Network (AMCRNet) that extracts multi-scale context through multiple pooling layers with different sizes. Specifically, we develop an Interactive Relation Extraction module to model the higher-order relation between the target person and the context (e.g., other persons and objects). Along this line, we further propose a History Feature Bank and Interaction method to achieve better performance by modeling such relation across continuing video clips. Extensive experimental results on AVA2.2 and UCF101-24 demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our proposed AMCRNet",

In this paper, we propose a black-box prompt tuning framework for VLMs to learn task-relevant prompts without back-propagation. In particular, the vision and language prompts are jointly optimized in the intrinsic parameter subspace with various evolution strategies. Different prompt variants are also explored to enhance the cross-model interaction. Experimental results show that our proposed black-box prompt tuning framework outperforms both hand-crafted prompt engineering and gradient-based prompt learning methods, which serves as evidence of its capability to train task-relevant prompts in a derivative-free manner",

    "abstract": "Vision model have gained increasing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. However, due to lacking the perception of linguistic knowledge and information, recent vision models suffer from two problems: (1) the pure vision-based query results in attention drift, which usually causes poor recognition and is summarized as linguistic insensitive drift (LID) problem in this paper. (2) the visual feature is suboptimal for the recognition in some vision-missing cases (e.g. occlusion, etc.). To address these issues, we propose a Linguistic Perception Vision model (LPV), which explores the linguistic capability of vision model for accurate text recognition. To alleviate the LID problem, we introduce a Cascade Position Attention (CPA) mechanism that obtains high-quality and accurate attention maps through step-wise optimization and linguistic information mining. Furthermore, a Global Linguistic Reconstruction Module (GLRM) is proposed to improve the representation of visual features by perceiving the linguistic information in the visual space, which gradually converts visual features into semantically rich ones during the cascade process. Different from previous methods, our method obtains SOTA results while keeping low complexity (92.4% accuracy with only 8.11M parameters). Code is available at https://github.com/CyrilSterling/LPV",

Most existing methods learn a fixed network to predict the action of each frame with the neighboring frames. However, this would result in ambiguity when estimating similar actions, such as pouring juice and pouring coffee. To address this, we aim to exploit temporally global but spatially local human-object interactions (HOI) as video-level prior knowledge for action segmentation. The long-term HOI sequence provides crucial contextual information to distinguish ambiguous actions, where our network dynamically adapts to the given HOI sequence at test time. More specifically, we first design a video HOI encoder that extracts, selects, and integrates the most representative HOI throughout the video. Then, we propose a two-branch HyperNetwork to learn an adaptive temporal encoder, which automatically adjusts the parameters based on the HOI information of various videos on the fly.

On the other hand, in empirical study, the code-oriented methods lose object consistency as their generated images miss certain objects in the input scene graph. To alleviate these two issues, we propose Learning Object Consistency and Interaction (LOCI). To preserve object consistency, we design a consistency module with a weighted augmentation strategy for objects easy to be ignored and a matching loss between scene graphs and image codes. To learn object interaction, we design an interaction module consisting of three kinds of message propagation between the input scene graph and the learned image code.

Specifically, our method incorporates an explicit self-supervised manifold regularization, revealing consistent cumulative target dependency across domains, to a self-training scheme (e.g., the popular Self-Paced Self-Training) to encourage more discriminative transferable representations of regression tasks. Moreover, learning unified implicit neural functions to estimate relative direction and distance of targets to their nearest class bins aims to refine target classification predictions, which can gain robust performance against inconsistent feature scaling sensitive to UDA regressors.

However, due to the scarcity of the support data provided, FSS methods still suffer from the intra-class and inter-class gaps. In this paper, we propose a uniform network to fill both the gaps, termed FGNet. It consists of the novel design of a Self-Adaptive Module (SAM) to emphasize the query feature to generate an enhanced prototype for self-alignment. Such a prototype caters to each query sample itself since it contains the underlying intra-instance information, which gets around the intra-class appearance gap. Moreover, we design an Inter-class Feature Separation Module (IFSM) to separate the feature space of the target class from other classes, which contributes to bridging the inter-class gap. In addition, we present several new losses and a method termed B-SLIC, which help to further enhance the separation performance of FGNet. Experimental results show that FGNet reduces both the gaps for FSS by SAM and IFSM respectively, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets compared with previous top-performing approaches",

    "abstract": "The visual quality of point clouds has been greatly emphasized since the ever-increasing 3D vision applications are expected to provide cost-effective and high-quality experiences for users.  Looking back on the development of point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), the visual quality is usually evaluated by utilizing single-modal information, i.e., either extracted from the 2D projections or 3D point cloud. The 2D projections contain rich texture and semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D point clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to viewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and projected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference Multi-Modal Point Cloud Quality Assessment (MM-PCQA) metric. In specific, we split the point clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as point shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image projections for texture feature extraction. To achieve the goals, the sub-models and projected images are encoded with point-based and image-based neural networks. Finally, symmetric cross-modal attention is employed to fuse multi-modal quality-aware information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of previous no-reference PCQA methods, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Text irregularities pose significant challenges to scene text recognizers. Thin-Plate Spline (TPS)-based rectification is widely regarded as an effective means to deal with them. Currently, the calculation of TPS transformation parameters purely depends on the quality of regressed text borders. It ignores the text content and often leads to unsatisfactory rectified results for severely distorted text. In this work, we introduce TPS++, an attention-enhanced TPS transformation that incorporates the attention mechanism to text rectification for the first time. TPS++ formulates the parameter calculation as a joint process of foreground control point regression and content-based attention score estimation, which is computed by a dedicated designed gated-attention block. TPS++ builds a more flexible content-aware rectifier, generating a natural text correction that is easier to read by the subsequent recognizer. Moreover, TPS++ shares the feature backbone with the recognizer in part and implements the rectification at feature-level rather than image-level, incurring only a small overhead in terms of parameters and inference time. Experiments on public benchmarks show that TPS++ consistently improves the recognition and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Meanwhile, it generalizes well on different backbones and recognizers.

    "title": "Video Frame Interpolation with Densely Queried Bilateral Correlation",
    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to synthesize non-existent intermediate frames between existent frames. Flow-based VFI algorithms estimate intermediate motion fields to warp the existent frames. Real-world motions' complexity and the reference frame's absence make motion estimation challenging. Many state-of-the-art approaches explicitly model the correlations between two neighboring frames for more accurate motion estimation. In common approaches, the receptive field of correlation modeling at higher resolution depends on the motion fields estimated beforehand. Such receptive field dependency makes common motion estimation approaches poor at coping with small and fast-moving objects. To better model correlations and to produce more accurate motion fields, we propose the Densely Queried Bilateral Correlation (DQBC) that gets rid of the receptive field dependency problem and thus is more friendly to small and fast-moving objects. The motion fields generated with the help of DQBC are further refined and up-sampled with context features. After the motion fields are fixed, a CNN-based SynthNet synthesizes the final interpolated frame. Experiments show that our approach enjoys higher accuracy and less inference time than the state-of-the-art. Source code is available at https://github.com/kinoud/DQBC",

    "title": "Pyramid Diffusion Models for Low-light Image Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Recovering noise-covered details from low-light images is challenging, and the results given by previous methods leave room for improvement. Recent diffusion models show realistic and detailed image generation through a sequence of denoising refinements and motivate us to introduce them to low-light image enhancement for recovering realistic details. However, we found two problems when doing this, i.e., 1) diffusion models keep constant resolution in one reverse process, which limits the speed; 2) diffusion models sometimes result in global degradation (e.g., RGB shift). To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Pyramid Diffusion model (PyDiff) for low-light image enhancement. PyDiff uses a novel pyramid diffusion method to perform sampling in a pyramid resolution style (i.e., progressively increasing resolution in one reverse process). Pyramid diffusion makes PyDiff much faster than vanilla diffusion models and introduces no performance degradation. Furthermore, PyDiff uses a global corrector to alleviate the global degradation that may occur in the reverse process, significantly improving the performance and making the training of diffusion models easier with little additional computational consumption. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that PyDiff achieves superior performance and efficiency. Moreover, PyDiff can generalize well to unseen noise and illumination distributions.

    "abstract": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a crucial role in industrial manufacturing by providing geometry information and the construction workflow for manufactured objects. The construction information enables effective re-editing of parametric CAD models. While boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard format for representing geometry structures, JSON format is an alternative due to the lack of uniform criteria for storing the construction workflow. Regrettably, most CAD models available on the Internet only offer geometry information, omitting the construction procedure and hampering creation efficiency. This paper proposes a learning approach CADParser to infer the underlying modeling sequences given a B-Rep CAD model. It achieves this by treating the CAD geometry structure as a graph and the construction workflow as a sequence. Since the existing CAD dataset only contains two operations (i.e., Sketch and Extrusion), limiting the diversity of the CAD model creation, we also introduce a large-scale dataset incorporating a more comprehensive range of operations such as Revolution, Fillet, and Chamfer. Each model includes both the geometry structure and the construction sequences.

Before embedding the frequency priors into the network, we first harmonize the multi-scale side-out features to reduce their heterogeneity. This is achieved by our feature harmonization module, which is based on a gating mechanism to harmonize the grouped features. Finally, we propose a frequency prior embedding module to embed the frequency priors into multi-scale features through an adaptive modulation strategy.

Due to the high cost of data annotation and data collection, current VLN datasets provide limited instruction-trajectory data samples. Learning vision-language alignment for VLN from limited data is challenging since visual observation and language instruction are both complex and diverse. Previous works only generate augmented data based on original scenes while failing to generate data samples from unseen scenes, which limits the generalization ability of the navigation agent. In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge-driven Environmental Dreamer (KED), a method that leverages the knowledge of the embodied environment and generates unseen scenes for a navigation agent to learn. Generating an unseen environment with texture consistency and structure consistency is challenging. To address this problem, we incorporate three knowledge-driven regularization objectives into the KED and adopt a reweighting mechanism for self-adaptive optimization. Our KED method is able to generate unseen embodied environments without extra annotations. We use KED to successfully generate 270 houses and 500K instruction-trajectory pairs. The navigation agent with the KED method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various VLN benchmarks, such as R2R, R4R, and RxR.

    "title": "Towards Accurate Video Text Spotting with Text-wise Semantic Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Video text spotting (VTS) aims at extracting texts from videos, where text detection, tracking and recognition are conducted simultaneously. There have been some works that can tackle VTS; however, they may ignore the underlying semantic relationships among texts within a frame. We observe that the texts within a frame usually share similar semantics, which suggests that, if one text is predicted incorrectly by a text recognizer, it still has a chance to be corrected via semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose an accurate video text spotter, VLSpotter, that reads texts visually, linguistically, and semantically. For ‘visually’, we propose a plug-and-play text-focused super-resolution module to alleviate motion blur and enhance video quality. For ‘linguistically’, a language model is employed to capture intra-text context to mitigate wrongly spelled text predictions. For ‘semantically’, we propose a text-wise semantic reasoning module to model inter-text semantic relationships and reason for better results. The experimental results on multiple VTS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed VLSpotter outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in end-to-end video text spotting",

    "abstract": "Using a regular language as a pattern for string matching is nowadays a common -and sometimes unsafe- operation, provided as a built-in feature by most programming languages. A proper constraint solver over string variables should support most of the operations over regular expressions and related constructs. However, state-of-the-art string solvers natively support only the membership relation of a string variable to a regular language. Here we take a step forward by defining a specialised propagator for the match operation, returning the leftmost position where a pattern can match a given string. Empirical evidences show the effectiveness of our approach, implemented within the constraint programming framework, and tested against state-of-the-art string solvers",

    "title": "Constraints First: A New MDD-based Model to Generate Sentences Under Constraints",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to generating strongly constrained texts. We consider standardized sentence generation for the typical application of vision screening. To solve this problem, we formalize it as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and utilize multivalued decision diagrams (MDD), a well-known data structure to deal with constraints. In our context, one key strength of MDD is to compute an exhaustive set of solutions without performing any search. Once the sentences are obtained, we apply a language model (GPT-2) to keep the best ones. We detail this for English and also for French where the agreement and conjugation rules are known to be more complex. Finally, with the help of GPT-2, we get hundreds of bona-fide candidate sentences. When compared with the few dozen sentences usually available in the well-known vision screening test (MNREAD), this brings a major breakthrough in the field of standardized sentence generation. Also, as it can be easily adapted for other languages, it has the potential to make the MNREAD test even more valuable and usable. More generally, this paper highlights MDD as a convincing alternative for constrained text generation, especially when the constraints are hard to satisfy, but also for many other prospects",

    "title": "Learning When to Use Automatic Tabulation in Constraint Model Reformulation",
    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimisation has numerous practical applications, such as planning, logistics, or circuit design. Problems such as these can be solved by approaches such as Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) or Constraint Programming (CP). Solver performance is affected significantly by the model chosen to represent a given problem, which has led to the study of model reformulation. One such method is tabulation: rewriting the expression of some of the model constraints in terms of a single “table” constraint. Successfully applying this process means identifying expressions amenable to trans- formation, which has typically been done manually. Recent work introduced an automatic tabulation using a set of hand-designed heuristics to identify constraints to tabulate. However, the performance of these heuristics varies across problem classes and solvers. Recent work has shown learning techniques to be increasingly useful in the context of automatic model reformulation. The goal of this study is to understand whether it is possible to improve the performance of such heuristics, by learning a model to predict whether or not to activate them for a given instance. Experimental results suggest that a random forest classifier is the most robust choice, improving the performance of four different SAT and CP solvers",

In this paper we consider the problem of deciding if a (likely incomplete) description of a system of events is consistent, the network consistency problem for the point algebra of partially ordered time (POT). While the classical complexity of this problem has been fully settled, comparably little is known of the fine-grained complexity of POT except that it can\r\nbe solved in O*((0.368n)^n) time by enumerating ordered partitions. We construct a much faster algorithm with a run-time bounded by O*((0.26n)^n), which, e.g., is roughly 1000 times faster than the naive enumeration algorithm in a problem with 20 events. This is achieved by a sophisticated enumeration of structures similar to total orders, which are then greedily expanded toward a solution. While similar ideas have been explored earlier for related problems it turns out that the analysis for POT is non-trivial and requires significant new ideas",

    "abstract": "Allen's interval algebra is one of the most well-known calculi in qualitative temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence. Very recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity of NP-hard reasoning tasks in this algebra, which has improved the running time from the naive 2^O(n^2) to O*((1.0615n)^n), and even faster algorithms are known for unit intervals and the case when we a bounded number of overlapping intervals. \r\nDespite these improvements the best known lower bound is still only 2^o(n) under the exponential-time hypothesis and major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances in computational complexity. \r\nIn this paper we propose a novel framework for solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic programming with sublinear partitioning. \r\n Using this technique we obtain a major improvement of O*((cn/log(n))^n) for Allen's interval algebra. To demonstrate that the technique is applicable to further problem domains we apply it to a problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction calculus, and solve it in O*((cn/log(n))^(2n/3)) time. Hence, not only do we significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems, but obtain a novel algorithmic technique that is likely applicable to many problems where 2^O(n) time algorithms are unlikely",

One typical strategy is algorithm unrolling, which relies on automatic differentiation through the operations of an iterative solver. While flexible and general, unrolling can encounter accuracy and efficiency issues in practice. These issues can be avoided by analytical differentiation of the optimization, but current frameworks impose rigid requirements on the optimization problem's form. This paper provides theoretical insights into the backward pass of unrolled optimization, leading to a system for generating  efficiently solvable analytical models of backpropagation. Additionally, it proposes a unifying view of unrolling and analytical differentiation through optimization mappings.

    "title": "Solving the Identifying Code Set Problem with Grouped Independent Support",
    "abstract": "An important problem in network science is finding an optimal placement of sensors in nodes in order to uniquely detect failures in the network. This problem can be modelled as an identifying code set (ICS) problem, introduced by Karpovsky et al. in 1998. The ICS problem aims to find a cover of a set S, such that the elements in the cover define a unique signature for each of the elements of S, and to minimise the cover’s cardinality. In this work, we study a generalised identifying code set (GICS) problem, where a unique signature must be found for each subset of S that has a cardinality of at most k (instead of just each element of S). The concept of an independent support of a Boolean formula was introduced by Chakraborty et al. in 2014 to speed up propositional model counting, by identifying a subset of variables whose truth assignments uniquely define those of the other variables.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce an extended version of independent support, grouped independent support (GIS), and show how to reduce the GICS problem to the GIS problem. We then propose a new solving method for finding a GICS, based on finding a GIS. We show that the prior state-of-the-art approaches yield integer-linear programming (ILP) models whose sizes grow exponentially with the problem size and k, while our GIS encoding only grows polynomially with the problem size and k. While the ILP approach can solve the GICS problem on networks of at most 494 nodes, the GIS-based method can handle networks of up to 21 363 nodes; a ∼40× improvement. The GIS-based method shows up to a 520× improvement on the ILP-based method in terms of median solving time. For the majority of the instances that can be encoded and solved by both methods, the cardinality of the solution returned by the GIS-based method is less than 10% larger than the cardinality of the solution found by the ILP method",

The core part of GAC for alldifferent constraints is excavating and enumerating all the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the graph model. This causes a large amount of complex data structures to maintain the node information, leading to a large overhead both in time and memory space. More critically, the complexity of the data structures further precludes the coordination of different optimization schemes for GAC. To solve this problem, the key observation of this paper is that the GAC algorithm only cares whether a node of the graph model is in an SCC or not, rather than which SCCs it belongs to. Based on this observation, we propose AllDiffbit, which employs bitwise data structures and operations to efficiently determine if a node is in an SCC. This greatly reduces the corresponding overhead, and enhances the ability to incorporate existing optimizations to work in a synergistic way. Our experiments show that AllDiffbit outperforms the state-of-the-art GAC algorithms over 60%",

    "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective way to learn generalized graph representations in a self-supervised manner, and has grown rapidly in recent years. However, the underlying community semantics has not been well explored by most previous GCL methods. Research that attempts to leverage communities in GCL regards them as having the same influence on the graph, leading to extra representation errors. To tackle this issue, we define ''community strength'' to measure the difference of influence among communities. Under this premise, we propose a Community-Strength-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning (CSGCL) framework to preserve community strength throughout the learning process. Firstly, we present two novel graph augmentation methods, Communal Attribute Voting (CAV) and Communal Edge Dropping (CED), where the perturbations of node attributes and edges are guided by community strength. Secondly, we propose a dynamic ''Team-up'' contrastive learning scheme, where community strength is used to progressively fine-tune the contrastive objective. We report extensive experiment results on three downstream tasks: node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. CSGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other GCL methods, validating that community strength brings effectiveness and generality to graph representations.

    "title": "Probabilistic Masked Attention Networks for Explainable Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based models are powerful for modeling temporal dynamics of user preference in sequential recommendation. Most of the variants adopt the Softmax transformation in the self-attention layers to generate dense attention probabilities. However, real-world item sequences are often noisy, containing a mixture of true-positive and false-positive interactions. Such dense attentions inevitably assign probability mass to noisy or irrelevant items, leading to sub-optimal performance and poor explainability. Here we propose a Probabilistic Masked Attention Network (PMAN) to identify the sparse pattern of attentions, which is more desirable for pruning noisy items in sequential recommendation. Specifically, we employ a probabilistic mask to achieve sparse attentions under a constrained optimization framework. As such, PMAN allows to select which information is critical to be retained or dropped in a data-driven fashion. Experimental studies on real-world benchmark datasets show that PMAN is able to improve the performance of Transformers significantly",

    "title": "Learning Gaussian Mixture Representations for Tensor Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Tensor time series (TTS) data, a generalization of one-dimensional time series on a high-dimensional space, is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, especially in monitoring systems involving multi-source spatio-temporal data (e.g., transportation demands and air pollutants). Compared to modeling time series or multivariate time series, which has received much attention and achieved tremendous progress in recent years, tensor time series has been paid less effort. Properly coping with the tensor time series is a much more challenging task, due to its high-dimensional and complex inner structure. In this paper, we develop a novel TTS forecasting framework, which seeks to individually model each heterogeneity component implied in the time, the location, and the source variables. We name this framework as GMRL, short for Gaussian Mixture Representation Learning. Experiment results on two real-world TTS datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

    "title": "Adaptive Path-Memory Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict the future missing facts based on historical information and has gained increasing research interest recently. Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR",

    "abstract": "Typically, trajectories considered anomalous are the ones deviating from usual (e.g., traffic-dictated) driving patterns. However, this closed-set context fails to recognize the unknown anomalous trajectories, resulting in an insufficient self-motivated learning paradigm. In this study, we investigate the novel Anomalous Trajectory Recognition problem in an Open-world scenario (ATRO) and introduce a novel probabilistic Metric learning model, namely ATROM, to address it. Specifically, ATROM can detect the presence of unknown anomalous behavior in addition to identifying known behavior. It has a Mutual Interaction Distillation that uses contrastive metric learning to explore the interactive semantics regarding the diverse behavioral intents and a Probabilistic Trajectory Embedding that forces the trajectories with distinct behaviors to follow different Gaussian priors. More importantly, ATROM offers a probabilistic metric rule to discriminate between known and unknown behavioral patterns by taking advantage of the approximation of multiple priors. Experimental results on two large-scale trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of ATROM in addressing both known and unknown anomalous patterns",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph-based anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted rising attention due to its effectiveness in identifying anomalies in relational and structured data. Unfortunately, the performance of most existing GAD methods suffers from the inherent structural noises of graphs induced by hidden anomalies connected with considerable benign nodes. In this work, we propose SparseGAD, a novel GAD framework that sparsifies the structures of target graphs to effectively reduce noises and collaboratively learns node representations. It then robustly detects anomalies by uncovering the underlying dependency among node pairs in terms of homophily and heterophily, two essential connection properties of GAD. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets of GAD demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better detection quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods, even when the graph is heavily attacked.

    "title": "Targeting Minimal Rare Itemsets from Transaction Databases",
    "abstract": "The computation of minimal rare itemsets is a well known task in data mining, with numerous applications, e.g., drugs effects analysis and network security, among others. This paper presents a novel approach to the computation of minimal rare itemsets. First, we introduce a generalization of the traditional minimal rare itemset model called k-minimal rare itemset. A k-minimal rare itemset is defined as an itemset that becomes frequent or rare based on the removal of at least k or at most (k − 1) items from it. We claim that our work is the first to propose this generalization in the field of data mining. We then present a SAT-based framework for efficiently discovering k-minimal rare itemsets from large transaction databases. Afterwards, by partitioning the k-minimal rare itemset mining problem into smaller sub-problems, we aim to make it more manageable and easier to solve. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, we conduct extensive experimental analysis using various popular datasets. We compare our method with existing specialized algorithms and CP-based algorithms commonly used for this task",

    "title": "Enhancing Network by Reinforcement Learning and Neural Confined Local Search",
    "abstract": "It has been found that many real networks, such as power grids and the Internet, are non-robust, i.e., attacking a small set of nodes would cause the paralysis of the entire network. Thus, the Network Enhancement Problem~(NEP), i.e., improving the robustness of a given network by modifying its structure, has attracted increasing attention. Heuristics have been proposed to address NEP. However, a hand-engineered heuristic often has significant performance limitations. A recently proposed model solving NEP by reinforcement learning has shown superior performance than heuristics on in-distribution datasets. However, their model shows considerably inferior out-of-distribution generalization ability when enhancing networks against the degree-based targeted attack. In this paper, we propose a more effective model with stronger generalization ability by incorporating domain knowledge including measurements of local network structures and decision criteria of heuristics. We further design a hierarchical attention model to utilize the network structure directly, where the query range changes from local to global. Finally, we propose neural confined local search~(NCLS) to realize the effective search of a large neighborhood, which exploits a learned model to confine the neighborhood to avoid exhaustive enumeration. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real networks to verify the ability of our models",

    "title": "OSDP: Optimal Sharded Data Parallel for Distributed Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models contribute to significant performance improvements on varieties of downstream tasks. Current data and model parallelism approaches utilize model replication and partition techniques to support the distributed training of ultra-large models. However, directly deploying these systems often leads to sub-optimal training efficiency due to the complex model architectures and the strict device memory constraints. In this paper, we propose Optimal Sharded Data Parallel (OSDP), an automated parallel training system that combines the advantages from both data and model parallelism. Given the model description and the device information, OSDP makes trade-offs between the memory consumption and the hardware utilization, thus automatically generates the distributed computation graph and maximizes the overall system throughput. In addition, OSDP introduces operator splitting to further alleviate peak memory footprints during training with negligible overheads, which enables the trainability of larger models as well as the higher throughput. Extensive experimental results of OSDP on multiple different kinds of large-scale models demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art in multiple regards",

    "title": "Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations",
    "abstract": "Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins",

This improves upon the previous work on sublinear approximate degeneracy, which implies a (4 + epsilon)-approximate ~O(n) solution. Our algorithm can be extended to an approximate O(n log n) time solution to the k-core decomposition problem. We also explore the use of our approximate algorithm as a technique for speeding up exact degeneracy computation. We prove theoretical guarantees of our algorithm and provide optimizations, which improve the running time of our algorithm in practice.

    "title": "SMARTformer: Semi-Autoregressive Transformer with Efficient Integrated Window Attention for Long Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "The success of Transformers in long time series forecasting (LTSF) can be attributed to their attention mechanisms and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoder structures, which capture long-range de- pendencies. However, time series data also contain abundant local temporal dependencies, which are often overlooked in the literature and significantly hinder forecasting performance. To address this issue, we introduce SMARTformer, which stands for SeMi-AutoRegressive Transformer. SMARTformer utilizes the Integrated Window Attention (IWA) and Semi-AutoRegressive (SAR) Decoder to capture global and local dependencies from both encoder and decoder perspectives. IWA conducts local self-attention in multi-scale windows and global attention across windows with linear com- plexity to achieve complementary clues in local and enlarged receptive fields. SAR generates subsequences iteratively, similar to autoregressive (AR) decoding, but refines the entire sequence in a NAR manner. This way, SAR benefits from both the global horizon of NAR and the local detail capturing of AR. We also introduce the Time-Independent Embedding (TIE), which better captures local dependencies by avoiding entanglements of various periods that can occur when directly adding po- sitional embedding to value embedding. Our ex- tensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SMARTformer against state-of-the-art models, achieving an improvement of 10.2% and 18.4% in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting, respectively",

    "abstract": "As deep learning gains popularity in modelling dynamical systems, we expose an underappreciated misunderstanding relevant to modelling dynamics on networks. Strongly influenced by graph neural networks, latent vertex embeddings are naturally adopted in many neural dynamical network models. However, we show that embeddings tend to induce a model that fits observations well but simultaneously has incorrect dynamical behaviours. Recognising that previous studies narrowly focus on short-term predictions during the transient phase of a flow, we propose three tests for correct long-term behaviour, and illustrate how an embedding-based dynamical model fails these tests, and analyse the causes, particularly through the lens of topological conjugacy. In doing so, we show that the difficulties can be avoided by not using embedding. We propose a simple embedding-free alternative based on parametrising two additive vector-field components. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the proposed model can reliably recover a broad class of dynamics on different network topologies from time series data",

    "abstract": "While massive valuable deep models trained on large-scale data have been released to facilitate the artificial intelligence community, they may encounter attacks in deployment which leads to privacy leakage of training data. In this work, we propose a learning approach termed differentially private data-free distillation (DPDFD) for model conversion that can convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via an intermediate generator without access to training data. The learning collaborates three parties in a unified way. First, massive synthetic data are generated with the generator. Then, they are fed into the teacher and student to compute differentially private gradients by normalizing the gradients and adding noise before performing descent. Finally, the student is updated with these differentially private gradients and the generator is updated by taking the student as a fixed discriminator in an alternate manner. In addition to a privacy-preserving student, the generator can generate synthetic data in a differentially private way for other down-stream tasks. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and well convergence. Extensive experiments that significantly outperform other differentially private generative approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach",

However, existing GTs still perform unsatisfactorily on the node classification task due to 1) the overwhelming unrelated information obtained from a vast number of irrelevant distant nodes and 2) the quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes via the fully connected attention mechanism. In this paper, we present Gapformer, a method for node classification that deeply incorporates Graph Transformer with Graph Pooling. More specifically, Gapformer coarsens the large-scale nodes of a graph into a smaller number of pooling nodes via local or global graph pooling methods, and then computes the attention solely with the pooling nodes rather than all other nodes. In such a manner, the negative influence of the overwhelming unrelated nodes is mitigated while maintaining the long-range information, and the quadratic complexity is reduced to linear complexity with respect to the fixed number of pooling nodes. Extensive experiments on 13 node classification datasets, including homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets, demonstrate the competitive performance of Gapformer over existing Graph Neural Networks and GTs",

    "abstract": "With the development of modern internet techniques, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) systems have been widely exploited for tackling the data-sparsity problem. Meanwhile most current CDR models assume that user-item interactions are accessible across different domains. However, such knowledge sharing process will break the privacy protection policy. In this paper, we focus on the  Privacy-Preserving Multi-Domain Recommendation problem (PPMDR). The problem is challenging since different domains are sparse and heterogeneous with the privacy protection. To tackle the above issues, we propose Federated Probabilistic Preference Distribution Modelling (FPPDM). FPPDM includes two main components, i.e., local domain modelling component and global server aggregation component with federated learning strategy. The local domain modelling component aims to exploit user/item preference distributions using the rating information in the corresponding domain. The global server aggregation component is set to combine user characteristics across domains. To better extract semantic neighbors information among the users, we further provide compactness co-clustering strategy in FPPDM ++ to cluster the users with similar characteristics.

By an experimental analysis, we discover the semantic information of an augmented graph structure may be not consistent as original graph structure, and whether two augmented graphs are positive or negative pairs is highly related with the multi-scale structures. Based on this finding, we propose a multi-scale subgraph contrastive learning architecture which is able to characterize the fine-grained semantic information. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different scales based on subgraph sampling, and construct multiple contrastive relationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer self-supervised signals.

Specifically, for each interaction, we present an evolution learning module to continuously update the dynamic states of the related users and cascade based on their currently encoded messages and previous dynamic states.

    "abstract": "To alleviate the burden of software maintenance, bug localization, which aims to automatically locate the buggy source files based on the bug report, has drawn significant attention in the software mining community. Recent studies indicate that the program structure in source code carries more semantics reflecting the program behavior, which is beneficial for bug localization. Benefiting from the rich structural information in the Control Flow Graph (CFG), CFG-based bug localization methods have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Existing CFG-based methods extract the semantic feature from the CFG via the graph neural network. However, the step-wise feature propagation in the graph neural network suffers from the problem of information loss when the propagation distance is long, while the long-distance dependency is rather common in the CFG. In this paper, we argue that the long-distance dependency is crucial for feature extraction from the CFG, and propose a novel bug localization model named sgAttention. In sgAttention, a particularly designed structural-guided attention is employed to globally capture the information in the CFG, where features of irrelevant nodes are masked for each node to facilitate better feature extraction from the CFG. Experimental results on four widely-used open-source software projects indicate that sgAttention averagely improves the state-of-the-art bug localization methods by 32.9\\% and 29.2\\% and the state-of-the-art pre-trained models by 5.8\\%  and 4.9\\% in terms of MAP and MRR, respectively",

    "title": "Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Traffic Signal Control under Missing Data",
    "abstract": "The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in traffic signal control (TSC) tasks has achieved promising results. Most RL approaches require the observation of the environment for the agent to decide which action is optimal for a long-term reward. However, in real-world urban scenarios, missing observation of traffic states may frequently occur due to the lack of sensors, which makes existing RL methods inapplicable on road networks with missing observation. In this work, we aim to control the traffic signals in a real-world setting, where some of the intersections in the road network are not installed with sensors and thus with no direct observations around them. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use RL methods to tackle the TSC problem in this real-world setting. Specifically, we propose two solutions: 1) imputes the traffic states to enable adaptive control. 2) imputes both states and rewards to enable adaptive control and the training of RL agents. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world road network traffic, we reveal that our method outperforms conventional approaches and performs consistently with different missing rates. We also investigate how missing data influences the performance of our model",

    "title": "Discriminative-Invariant Representation Learning for Unbiased Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Selection bias hinders recommendation models from learning unbiased user preference. Recent works empirically reveal that pursuing invariant user and item representation across biased and unbiased data is crucial for counteracting selection bias. However, our theoretical analysis reveals that simply optimizing representation invariance is insufficient for addressing the selection bias — recommendation performance is bounded by both representation invariance and discriminability. Worse still, current invariant representation learning methods in recommendation neglect even hurt the representation discriminability due to data sparsity and label shift. In this light, we propose a new Discriminative-Invariant Representation Learning framework for unbiased recommendation, which incorporates label-conditional clustering and prior-guided contrasting into conventional invariant representation learning to mitigate the impact of data sparsity and label shift, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, validating the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

    "title": "Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation in Graph Transfer Learning",
    "abstract": "As a specific case of graph transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs aims for knowledge transfer from label-rich source graphs to unlabeled target graphs. However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding. Thus, the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids. Finally, extensive experiments on a range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed SGDA in different experimental settings",

    "abstract": "User review data is considered as auxiliary information to alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the quality of learned user/item or interaction representations in review-based recommender systems. However, existing methods usually model user-item interactions in a holistic manner and neglect the entanglement of the latent intents behind them, e.g., price, quality, or appearance, resulting in suboptimal representations and reducing interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Graph Disentangled Networks for review-based recommendation (SGDN), to separately model the user-item interactions based on the latent factors through the textual review data. To this end, we first model the distributions of interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review data and structural information in user-item graph data, forming several factor graphs. Then a factorized message passing mechanism is designed to learn disentangled user/item and interaction representations on the factor graphs. Finally, we set an intent-aware contrastive learning task to alleviate the sparsity issue and encourage disentanglement through dynamically identifying positive and negative samples based on the learned intent distributions. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets validate the superiority of  SGDN over the state-of-the-art methods and the  interpretability of learned intent factors",

    "abstract": "Graph clustering is a longstanding research topic, and has achieved remarkable success with the deep learning methods in recent years. Nevertheless, we observe that several important issues largely remain open. On the one hand, graph clustering from the geometric perspective is appealing but has rarely been touched before, as it lacks a promising space for geometric clustering. On the other hand, contrastive learning boosts the deep graph clustering but usually struggles in either graph augmentation or hard sample mining. To bridge this gap, we rethink the problem of graph clustering from geometric perspective and, to the best of our knowledge, make the first attempt to introduce a heterogeneous curvature space to graph clustering problem. Correspondingly, we present a novel end-to-end contrastive graph clustering model named CONGREGATE, addressing geometric graph clustering with Ricci curvatures. To support geometric clustering, we construct a theoretically grounded Heterogeneous Curvature Space where deep representations are generated via the product of the proposed fully Riemannian graph convolutional nets. Thereafter, we train the graph clusters by an augmentation-free reweighted contrastive approach where we pay more attention to both hard negatives and hard positives in our curvature space. Empirical results on real-world graphs show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection aims to distinguish abnormal instances that deviate significantly from the majority of benign ones. As instances that appear in the real world are naturally connected and can be represented with graphs, graph neural networks become increasingly popular in tackling the anomaly detection problem. Despite the promising results, research on anomaly detection has almost exclusively focused on static graphs while the mining of anomalous patterns from dynamic graphs is rarely studied but has significant application value. In addition, anomaly detection is typically tackled from semi-supervised perspectives due to the lack of sufficient labeled data. However, most proposed methods are limited to merely exploiting labeled data, leaving a large number of unlabeled samples unexplored. In this work, we present semi-supervised anomaly detection (SAD), an end-to-end framework for anomaly detection on dynamic graphs. By a combination of a time-equipped memory bank and a pseudo-label contrastive learning module, SAD is able to fully exploit the potential of large unlabeled samples and uncover underlying anomalies on evolving graph streams. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SAD efficiently discovers anomalies from dynamic graphs and outperforms existing advanced methods even when provided with only little labeled data",

However, while variants of attention-based GNNs are setting new benchmarks for numerous real-world datasets, recent works have pointed out that their induced attentions are less robust and generalizable against noisy graphs due to lack of direct supervision. In this paper, we present a new framework which utilizes the tool of causality to provide a powerful supervision signal for the learning process of attention functions. Specifically, we estimate the direct causal effect of attention to the final prediction, and then maximize such effect to guide attention attending to more meaningful neighbors. Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module for any canonical attention-based GNNs in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets illustrated that, by directly supervising attention functions, the model is able to converge faster with a clearer decision boundary, and thus yields better performances",

    "abstract": "Social recommendation is gaining increasing attention in various online applications, including e-commerce and online streaming, where social information is leveraged to improve user-item interaction modeling. Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be remarkably effective in addressing data sparsity through augmented learning tasks. Inspired by this, researchers have attempted to incorporate SSL into social recommendation by supplementing the primary supervised task with social-aware self-supervised signals. However, social information can be unavoidably noisy in characterizing user preferences due to the ubiquitous presence of interest-irrelevant social connections, such as colleagues or classmates who do not share many common interests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel social recommender called the Denoised Self-Augmented Learning paradigm (DSL). Our model not only preserves helpful social relations to enhance user-item interaction modeling but also enables personalized cross-view knowledge transfer through adaptive semantic alignment in embedding space.

    "abstract": "Open knowledge graph (OpenKG) link prediction aims to predict missing factual triples in the form of (head noun phrase, relation phrase, tail noun phrase). Since triples are not canonicalized, previous methods either focus on canonicalizing noun phrases (NPs) to reduce graph sparsity, or utilize textual forms to improve type compatibility. However, they neglect to canonicalize relation phrases (RPs) and triples, making OpenKG maintain high sparsity and impeding the performance. To address the above issues, we propose a Canonicalization-Enhanced Known Fact-Aware (CEKFA) framework that boosts link prediction performance through sparsity reduction of RPs and triples. First, we propose a similarity-driven RP canonicalization method to reduce RPs' sparsity by sharing knowledge of semantically similar ones. Second, to reduce the sparsity of triples, a known fact-aware triple canonicalization method is designed to retrieve relevant known facts from training data. Finally, these two types of canonical information are integrated into a general two-stage re-ranking framework that can be applied to most existing knowledge graph embedding methods. Experiment results on two OpenKG datasets, ReVerb20K and ReVerb45K, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable  recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal.

    "abstract": "Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction in real-world recommender systems often deals with billions of user interactions every day. To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness-aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness-aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Recently, Zero-Shot Node Classification (ZNC) has been an emerging and crucial task in graph data analysis. This task aims to predict nodes from unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features' prototypes and labels' semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the semantics of multiple labels. It's necessary to separate and judge the semantic factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity of the graph's instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by node information aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several public graph datasets and design an application of zero-shot cross-domain recommendation. The quantitative results demonstrate both the effectiveness and generalization of KMF with the comparison of state-of-the-art baselines",

Additionally, it categorizes GTs into three distinct types and provides tailored accelerating methods for each category to encompass all types of GTs. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the performance gap between KDLGT and self-attention to ensure its effectiveness. Under this framework, we select two representative GTs to design our models.

A variety of anomaly detection methods have been proposed, and a category based on the isolation forest mechanism stands out due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency, e.g., iForest is often employed as a state-of-the-art detector for real deployment. While the majority of isolation forests use the binary structure, a framework LSHiForest has demonstrated that the multi-fork isolation tree structure can lead to better detection performance. However, there is no theoretical work answering the fundamentally and practically important question on the optimal tree structure for an isolation forest with respect to the branching factor. In this paper, we establish a theory on isolation efficiency to answer the question and determine the optimal branching factor for an isolation tree. Based on the theoretical underpinning, we design a practical optimal isolation forest OptIForest incorporating clustering based learning to hash which enables more information to be learned from data for better isolation quality. The rationale of our approach relies on a better bias-variance trade-off achieved by bias reduction in OptIForest.

We find that items occurring in the same basket have much higher correlations than those randomly selected by conducting data analysis on a real dataset. \r\nSecond, although some works have recognized the importance of items repeatedly purchased in multiple baskets, they ignore the correlations among the repeated items in a same basket, whose importance is  shown by our data analysis.

Specifically, we first connect all the items (in a basket) as a hyperedge, where the correlations among different items can be well exploited by hypergraph convolution operations. Meanwhile, we also connect all the repeated items in the same basket as a hyperedge, whereby their correlations can be further strengthened. We generate a negative (positive) view of the basket by data augmentation on repeated (non-repeated) items, and apply contrastive learning to force more agreements on repeated items.

Recent neural-symbolic SR models demonstrate their potential to enable SR to be equipped with concurrent perception and cognition capacities. However, neural-symbolic SR remains a challenging problem due to open issues like representing users and items in logical reasoning. In this paper, we combine the Deep Neural Network (DNN) SR models with logical reasoning and propose a general framework named Sequential Recommendation with Probabilistic Logical Reasoning (short for SR-PLR). This framework allows SR-PLR to benefit from both similarity matching and logical reasoning by disentangling feature embedding and logic embedding in the DNN and probabilistic logic network. To better capture the uncertainty and evolution of user tastes, SR-PLR embeds users and items with a probabilistic method and conducts probabilistic logical reasoning on users' interaction patterns.  Then the feature and logic representations learned from the DNN and logic network are concatenated to make the prediction.
