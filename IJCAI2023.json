    "title": "Proportionally Fair Online Allocation of Public Goods with Predictions",
    "abstract": "We design online algorithms for fair allocation of public goods to a set of N agents over a sequence of T rounds and focus on improving their performance using predictions. In the basic model, a public good arrives in each round, and every agent reveals their value for it upon arrival. The algorithm must irrevocably decide the investment in this good without exceeding a total budget of B across all rounds. The algorithm can utilize (potentially noisy) predictions of each agent’s total value for all remaining goods. The algorithm's performance is measured using a proportional fairness objective, which informally demands that every group of agents be rewarded proportional to its size and the cohesiveness of its preferences. We show that no algorithm can achieve better than Θ(T/B) proportional fairness without predictions. With reasonably accurate predictions, the situation improves significantly, and Θ(log(T/B)) proportional fairness is achieved. We also extend our results to a general setting wherein a batch of L public goods arrive in each round and O(log(min(N,L)T/B)) proportional fairness is achieved. Our exact bounds are parameterized as a function of the prediction error, with performance degrading gracefully with increasing errors",

    "title": "On the Role of Memory in Robust Opinion Dynamics",
    "abstract": "We investigate opinion dynamics in a fully-connected system, consisting of n agents, where one of the opinions, called correct, represents a piece of information to disseminate. \r\nOne source agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion throughout the execution. The goal of the remaining agents is to quickly agree on this correct opinion. At each round, one agent chosen uniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the opinions of l random agents and then updates its opinion according to some rule. \r\nWe consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they only revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently sample. \r\nThis setting encompasses very popular opinion dynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-k majority rules. \r\n\r\nQualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient  convergence. Specifically, we prove that any dynamics requires Omega(n^2) expected time, even under a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete access to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case l=n. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which l=1) correctly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower bound. \r\n\r\nThese results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that do not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct opinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may require the use of memory",

    "abstract": "Opinion diffusion is a crucial phenomenon in social networks, often underlying the way in which a collection of agents develops a consensus on relevant decisions.  Voter models are well-known theoretical models to study opinion spreading in social networks and structured populations. Their simplest version assumes that an updating agent will adopt the opinion of a neighboring agent chosen at random. These models allow us to study, for example, the probability that a certain opinion will fixate into a consensus opinion, as well as the expected time it takes for a consensus opinion to emerge. \r\n\r\nStandard voter models are oblivious to the opinions held by the agents involved in the opinion adoption process. We propose and study a context-dependent opinion spreading process on an arbitrary social graph, in which the probability that an agent abandons opinion a in favor of opinion b depends on both a and b. We discuss the relations of the model with existing voter models and then derive theoretical results for both the fixation probability and the expected consensus time for two opinions, for both the synchronous and the asynchronous update models",

This work presents an approach for generating policy-level contrastive explanations for MARL to answer a temporal user query, which specifies a sequence of tasks completed by agents with possible cooperation. The proposed approach encodes the temporal query as a PCTL* logic formula and checks if the query is feasible under a given MARL policy via probabilistic model checking. Such explanations can help reconcile discrepancies between the actual and anticipated multi-agent behaviors. The proposed approach also generates correct and complete explanations to pinpoint reasons that make a user query infeasible. We have successfully applied the proposed approach to four benchmark MARL domains (up to 9 agents in one domain). Moreover, the results of a user study show that the generated explanations significantly improve user performance and satisfaction",

    "title": "Safe Multi-agent Learning via Trapping Regions",
    "abstract": "One of the main challenges of multi-agent learning lies in establishing convergence of the algorithms, as, in general, a collection of individual, self-serving agents is not guaranteed to converge with their joint policy, when learning concurrently. This is in stark contrast to most single-agent environments, and sets a prohibitive barrier for deployment in practical applications, as it induces uncertainty in long term behavior of the system. In this work, we apply the concept of trapping regions, known from qualitative theory of dynamical systems, to create safety sets in the joint strategy space for decentralized learning. We propose a binary partitioning algorithm for verification that candidate sets form trapping regions in systems with known learning dynamics, and a heuristic sampling algorithm for scenarios where learning dynamics are not known. We demonstrate the applications to a regularized version of Dirac Generative Adversarial Network,  a four-intersection traffic control scenario run in a state of the art open-source microscopic traffic simulator SUMO, and a mathematical model of economic competition",

We show how online goal recognition can be incorporated into an MCTS-based intention scheduler, and evaluate our approach in a range of scenarios.

    "abstract": "Repeated games consider a situation where multiple agents are motivated by their independent rewards throughout learning. In general, the dynamics of their learning become complex. Especially when their rewards compete with each other like zero-sum games, the dynamics often do not converge to their optimum, i.e., the Nash equilibrium. To tackle such complexity, many studies have understood various learning algorithms as dynamical systems and discovered qualitative insights among the algorithms. However, such studies have yet to handle multi-memory games (where agents can memorize actions they played in the past and choose their actions based on their memories), even though memorization plays a pivotal role in artificial intelligence and interpersonal relationship. This study extends two major learning algorithms in games, i.e., replicator dynamics and gradient ascent, into multi-memory games. Then, we prove their dynamics are identical. Furthermore, theoretically and experimentally, we clarify that the learning dynamics diverge from the Nash equilibrium in multi-memory zero-sum games and reach heteroclinic cycles (sojourn longer around the boundary of the strategy space), providing a fundamental advance in learning in games",

However, existing works either broadcast the messages leading to information redundancy, or learn targeted communication by modeling all the other agents as targets, which is not scalable when the number of agents varies. In this work, to tackle the scalability problem of MARL communication for partially-observed tasks, we propose a novel framework Transformer-based Email Mechanism (TEM). The agents adopt local communication to send messages only to the ones that can be observed without modeling all the agents. Inspired by human cooperation with email forwarding, we design message chains to forward information to cooperate with the agents outside the observation range. We introduce Transformer to encode and decode the message chain to choose the next receiver selectively. Empirically, TEM outperforms the baselines on multiple cooperative MARL benchmarks.

    "title": "Beyond Strict Competition: Approximate Convergence of Multi-agent Q-Learning Dynamics",
    "abstract": "The behaviour of multi-agent learning in competitive settings is often considered under the restrictive assumption of a zero-sum game. Only under this strict requirement is the behaviour of learning well understood; beyond this, learning dynamics can often display non-convergent behaviours which prevent fixed-point analysis. Nonetheless, many relevant competitive games do not satisfy the zero-sum assumption.\r\nMotivated by this, we study a smooth variant of Q-Learning, a popular reinforcement learning dynamics which balances the agents' tendency to maximise their payoffs with their propensity to explore the state space. We examine this dynamic in games which are `close' to network zero-sum games and find that Q-Learning converges to a neighbourhood around a unique equilibrium. The size of the neighbourhood is determined by the `distance' to the zero-sum game, as well as the exploration rates of the agents. We complement these results by providing a method whereby, given an arbitrary network game, the `nearest' network zero-sum game can be found efficiently. Importantly, our theoretical guarantees are widely applicable in different game settings, regardless of whether the dynamics ultimately reach an equilibrium, or remain non convergent",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study a computational version of the principal-agent problem -- a classic problem in Economics that arises when a principal desires to contract an agent to carry out some task, but has incomplete information about the agent or their subsequent actions. The key challenge in this setting is for the principal to design a contract for the agent such that the agent's preferences are then aligned with those of the principal. We study this problem using a variation of Boolean games, where multiple players each choose valuations for Boolean variables under their control, seeking the satisfaction of a personal goal formula. In our setting, the principal can only observe some subset of these variables, and the principal chooses a contract which rewards players on the basis of the assignments they make for the variables that are observable to the principal. The principal's challenge is to design a contract so that, firstly, the principal's goal is achieved in some or all Nash equilibrium choices, and secondly, that the principal is able to verify that their goal is satisfied.

The predicted distribution is used for computing a normality score for the agents, which allows the detection of the misbehavior of other agents. To explore the robustness of the proposed detection scheme, we formulate the worst-case attack against our scheme as a constrained reinforcement learning problem.

    "abstract": "The use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods in coordinating traffic lights (CTL) has become increasingly popular, treating each intersection as an agent. However, existing MARL approaches either treat each agent absolutely homogeneous, i.e., same network and parameter for each agent, or treat each agent completely heterogeneous, i.e., different networks and parameters for each agent. This creates a difficult balance between accuracy and complexity, especially in large-scale CTL. To address this challenge, we propose a grouped MARL method named GPLight. We first mine the similarity between agent environment considering both real-time traffic flow and static fine-grained road topology. Then we propose two loss functions to maintain a learnable and dynamic clustering, one that uses mutual information estimation for better stability, and the other that maximizes separability between groups. Finally, GPLight enforces the agents in a group to share the same network and parameters. This approach reduces complexity by promoting cooperation within the same group of agents while reflecting differences between groups to ensure accuracy. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 1,089 intersections.

    "abstract": "Sharing intentions is crucial for efficient cooperation in communication-enabled multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work applies static or undirected graphs to determine the order of interaction. However, the static graph is not general for complex cooperative tasks, and the parallel message-passing update in the undirected graph with cycles cannot guarantee convergence. To solve this problem, we propose Deep Hierarchical Communication Graph (DHCG) to learn the dependency relationships between agents based on their messages. The relationships are formulated as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where the selection of the proper topology is viewed as an action and trained in an end-to-end fashion. To eliminate the cycles in the graph, we apply an acyclicity constraint as intrinsic rewards and then project the graph in the admissible solution set of DAGs. As a result, DHCG removes redundant communication edges for cost improvement and guarantees convergence. To show the effectiveness of the learned graphs, we propose policy-based and value-based DHCG. Policy-based DHCG factorizes the joint policy in an auto-regressive manner, and value-based DHCG factorizes the joint value function to individual value functions and pairwise payoff functions.

    "abstract": "We study a rumor spreading model where individuals are connected via a network structure. Initially, only a small subset of the individuals are spreading a rumor. Each individual who is connected to a spreader, starts spreading the rumor with some probability as a function of their trust in the spreader, quantified by the Jaccard similarity index. Furthermore, the probability that a spreader diffuses the rumor decreases over time until they fully lose their interest and stop spreading.\r\n\r\nWe focus on determining the graph parameters which govern the magnitude and pace that the rumor spreads in this model. We prove that for the rumor to spread to a sizable fraction of the individuals, the network needs to enjoy ``strong'' expansion properties and most nodes should be in ``well-connected'' communities. Both of these characteristics are, arguably, present in real-world social networks up to a certain degree, shedding light on the driving force behind the extremely fast spread of rumors in social networks.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we formulate a large range of countermeasures to cease the spread of a rumor. We introduce four fundamental criteria which a countermeasure ideally should possess. We evaluate all the proposed countermeasures by conducting experiments on real-world social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. We conclude that our novel decentralized countermeasures (which are executed by the individuals) generally outperform the previously studied centralized ones (which need to be imposed by a third entity such as the government)",

    "abstract": "This study extends the recently-developed LaCAM algorithm for multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF). LaCAM is a sub-optimal search-based algorithm that uses lazy successor generation to dramatically reduce the planning effort. We present two enhancements. First, we propose its anytime version, called LaCAM*, which eventually converges to optima, provided that solution costs are accumulated transition costs. Second, we improve the successor generation to quickly obtain initial solutions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate their utility. For instance, LaCAM* sub-optimally solved 99% of the instances retrieved from the MAPF benchmark, where the number of agents varied up to a thousand, within ten seconds on a standard desktop PC, while ensuring eventual convergence to optima; developing a new horizon of MAPF algorithms",

Conventional MRMP studies mostly take the form of two-phase planning that constructs roadmaps and then finds inter-robot collision-free paths on those roadmaps. In contrast, SSSP simultaneously performs roadmap construction and collision-free pathfinding. This is realized by uniting techniques of single-robot sampling-based motion planning and search techniques of multi-agent pathfinding on discretized spaces. Doing so builds the small search space, leading to quick MRMP. SSSP ensures finding a solution eventually if exists. Our empirical evaluations in various scenarios demonstrate that SSSP significantly outperforms standard approaches to MRMP, i.e., solving more problem instances much faster. We also applied SSSP to planning for 32 ground robots in a dense situation",

A task allocation algorithm based on Fisher market clearing (FMC_TA), that can be performed either centrally or distributively, has been shown to produce high quality allocations in comparison to both centralized and distributed state of the art incomplete optimization algorithms. However, the algorithm is synchronous and therefore depends on perfect communication between agents.\r\n\r\nWe propose FMC_ATA, an asynchronous version of FMC_TA, which is robust to message latency and message loss. In contrast to the former version of the algorithm, FMC_ATA allows agents to identify dynamic events and initiate the generation of an updated allocation. Thus, it is more compatible for dynamic environments. We further investigate the conditions in which the distributed version of the algorithm is preferred over the centralized version. Our results indicate that the proposed asynchronous distributed algorithm produces consistent results even when the communication level is extremely poor",

    "abstract": "In the study of reactive systems, qualitative properties are usually easier to model and analyze than quantitative properties. This is especially true in systems where mutually beneficial cooperation between agents is possible, such as multi-agent systems. The large number of possible payoffs available to agents in reactive systems with quantitative properties means that there are many scenarios in which agents deviate from mutually beneficial outcomes in order to gain negligible payoff improvements. This behavior often leads to less desirable outcomes for all agents involved. For this reason we study satisficing goals, derived from a decision-making approach aimed at meeting a good-enough outcome instead of pure optimization. By considering satisficing goals, we are able to employ efficient automata-based algorithms to find pure-strategy Nash equilibria. We then show that these algorithms extend to scenarios in which agents have multiple thresholds, providing an approximation of optimization while still retaining the possibility of mutually beneficial cooperation and efficient automata-based algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate a one-way correspondence between the existence of epsilon-equilibria and the existence of equilibria in games where agents have multiple thresholds",

A crucial part of coalition formation that is extensively studied in AI is coalition structure generation: partitioning agents into coalitions to maximize overall value. \r\nIn this paper, we propose a novel method for coalition structure generation by introducing a compact and efficient representation of coalition structures. Our representation partitions the solution space into smaller, more manageable subspaces that gather structures containing coalitions of specific sizes. Our proposed method combines two new algorithms, one which leverages our compact representation and a branch-and-bound technique to generate optimal coalition structures, and another that utilizes a preprocessing phase to identify the most promising sets of coalitions to evaluate. Additionally, we show how parts of the solution space can be gathered into groups to avoid their redundant evaluation and we investigate the computational gain that is achieved by avoiding that redundant processing. Through this approach, our algorithm is able to prune the solution space more efficiently. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to prior state-of-the-art methods in generating optimal coalition structures under several value distributions",

They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies",

Previous works argue that complex dynamics between agents and the huge exploration space in MARL scenarios amplify the vulnerability of classical count-based exploration methods when combined with agents parameterized by neural networks, resulting in inefficient exploration. In this paper, we show that introducing constrained joint policy diversity into a classical count-based method can significantly improve exploration when agents are parameterized by neural networks. Specifically, we propose a joint policy diversity to measure the difference between current joint policy and previous joint policies, and then use a filtering-based exploration constraint to further refine the joint policy diversity. Under the sparse-reward setting, we show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the multiple-particle environment, the Google Research Football, and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks.

For example, a spacious hall leads to more reverberation. Room Impulse Responses (RIR) are commonly used to characterize environment acoustics as a function of the scene geometry, materials, and source/receiver locations. Traditionally, RIRs are measured by setting up a loudspeaker and microphone in the environment for all source/receiver locations, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We propose to let two robots measure the environment's acoustics by actively moving and emitting/receiving sweep signals. We also devise a collaborative multi-agent policy where these two robots are trained to explore the environment's acoustics while being rewarded for wide exploration and accurate prediction. We show that the robots learn to collaborate and move to explore environment acoustics while minimizing the prediction error.

Every agent learns to cooperate without access to the observations and policies of others. However, the decentralized training of multi-agent is of great difficulty due to non-stationarity, especially when other agents' policies are also in learning during training. To overcome this, we propose to learn a dynamic policy belief for each agent to predict the current policies of other agents and accordingly condition the policy of its own. To quickly adapt to the development of others' policies, we introduce a historical context to learn the belief inference according to a few recent action histories of other agents and a latent variational inference to model their policies by a learned distribution.

However, existing MARL approaches are mostly bound by the simultaneous actions of all agents in the Markov game (MG) framework, and few works consider the formation of equilibrium strategies via asynchronous action coordination. In view of the advantages of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) over Nash equilibrium, we construct a spatio-temporal sequential decision-making structure derived from the MG and propose an N-level policy model based on a conditional hypernetwork shared by all agents. This approach allows for asymmetric training with symmetric execution, with each agent responding optimally conditioned on the decisions made by superior agents. Agents can learn heterogeneous SE policies while still maintaining parameter sharing, which leads to reduced cost for learning and storage and enhanced scalability as the number of agents increases. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively converges to the SE policies in repeated matrix game scenarios, and performs admirably in immensely complex settings including cooperative tasks and mixed tasks",

The former involves deception, and is inherently undesirable, whereas the latter may well be a desirable goal insofar as it changes true individual qualification. We study misreporting and recourse as strategic choices by individuals within a unified framework. In particular, we propose auditing as a means to incentivize recourse actions over attribute manipulation, and characterize optimal audit policies for two types of principals, utility-maximizing and recourse-maximizing. Additionally, we consider subsidies as an incentive for recourse over manipulation, and show that even a utility-maximizing principal would be willing to devote a considerable amount of audit budget to providing such subsidies.

Although methods for mitigating unfairness are constantly proposed, little research has been conducted to understand how discrimination and bias develop during the standard training process. In this study, we propose analyzing the contribution of each subgroup (i.e., a group of data with the same sensitive attribute) in the training process to understand the cause of such bias development process. We propose a gradient-based metric to assess training subgroup contribution disparity, showing that unequal contributions from different subgroups are one source of such unfairness. One way to balance the contribution of each subgroup is through oversampling, which ensures that an equal number of samples are drawn from each subgroup during each training iteration. However, we have found that even with a balanced number of samples, the contribution of each group remains unequal, resulting in unfairness under the oversampling strategy. To address the above issues, we propose an easy but effective group contribution matching (GCM) method to match the contribution of each subgroup.

Existing efforts typically address the robust RL problem by solving a max-min problem. The main idea is to maximize the cumulative reward under the worst-possible perturbations. However, the worst-case optimization either leads to overly conservative solutions or unstable training process, which further affects the policy robustness and generalization performance. In this paper, we tackle this problem from both formulation definition and algorithm design. First, we formulate the robust RL as a max-expectation optimization problem, where the goal is to find an optimal policy under both the worst cases and the non-worst cases. Then, we propose a novel framework DRRL to solve the max-expectation optimization. Given our definition of the feasible tasks, a task generation and sequencing mechanism is introduced to dynamically output tasks at appropriate difficulty level for the current policy. With these progressive tasks, DRRL realizes dynamic multi-task learning to improve the policy robustness and the training stability.

    "title": "Towards Robust Gan-Generated Image Detection: A Multi-View Completion Representation",
    "abstract": "GAN-generated image detection now becomes the first line of defense against the malicious uses of machine-synthesized image manipulations such as deepfakes. Although some existing detectors work well in detecting clean, known GAN samples, their success is largely attributable to overfitting unstable features such as frequency artifacts, which will cause failures when facing unknown GANs or perturbation attacks. To overcome the issue, we propose a robust detection framework based on a novel multi-view image completion representation. The framework first learns various view-to-image tasks to model the diverse distributions of genuine images. Frequency-irrelevant features can be represented from the distributional discrepancies characterized by the completion models, which are stable, generalized, and robust for detecting unknown fake patterns. Then, a multi-view classification is devised with elaborated intra- and inter-view learning strategies to enhance view-specific feature representation and cross-view feature aggregation, respectively. We evaluated the generalization ability of our framework across six popular GANs at different resolutions and its robustness against a broad range of perturbation attacks. The results confirm our method's improved effectiveness, generalization, and robustness over various baselines",

    "title": "Explanation-Guided Reward Alignment",
    "abstract": "Agents often need to infer a reward function from observations to learn desired behaviors. However, agents may infer a reward function that does not align with the original intent because there can be multiple reward functions consistent with its observations. Operating based on such misaligned rewards can be risky. Furthermore, black-box representations make it difficult to verify the learned rewards and prevent harmful behavior. We present a framework for verifying and improving reward alignment using explanations and show how explanations can help detect misalignment and reveal failure cases in novel scenarios. The problem is formulated as inverse reinforcement learning from ranked trajectories. Verification tests created from the trajectory dataset are used to iteratively validate and improve reward alignment. The agent explains its learned reward and a tester signals whether the explanation passes the test. In cases where the explanation fails, the agent offers alternative explanations to gather feedback, which is then used to improve the learned reward. We analyze the efficiency of our approach in improving reward alignment using different types of explanations and demonstrate its effectiveness in five domains",

    "title": "Adversarial Behavior Exclusion for Safe Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Learning by exploration makes reinforcement learning (RL) potentially attractive for many real-world applications. However, this learning process makes RL inherently too vulnerable to be used in real-world applications where safety is of utmost importance. Most prior studies consider exploration at odds with safety and thereby restrict it using either joint optimization of task and safety or imposing constraints for safe exploration. This paper migrates from the current convention to using exploration as a key to safety by learning safety as a robust behavior that completely excludes any behavioral pattern responsible for safety violations. Adversarial Behavior Exclusion for Safe RL (AdvEx-RL) learns a behavioral representation of the agent's safety violations by approximating an optimal adversary utilizing exploration and later uses this representation to learn a separate safety policy that excludes those unsafe behaviors. In addition, AdvEx-RL ensures safety in a task-agnostic manner by acting as a safety firewall and therefore can be integrated with any RL task policy. We demonstrate the robustness of AdvEx-RL via comprehensive experiments in standard constrained Markov decision processes (CMDP) environments under 2 white-box action space perturbations as well as with changes in environment dynamics against 7 baselines. Consistently, AdvEx-RL outperforms the baselines by achieving an average safety performance of over 75% in the continuous action space with 10 times more variations in the testing environment dynamics. By using a standalone safety policy independent of conflicting objectives, AdvEx-RL also paves the way for interpretable safety behavior analysis as we show in our user study",

While drifts in model accuracy have been widely investigated, drifts in fairness metrics over time remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose FEAMOE, a novel \"mixture-of-experts\" inspired framework aimed at learning fairer, more interpretable models that can also rapidly adjust to drifts in both the accuracy and the fairness of a classifier. We illustrate our framework for three popular fairness measures and demonstrate how drift can be handled with respect to these fairness constraints. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our framework as applied to a mixture of linear experts is able to perform comparably to neural networks in terms of accuracy while producing fairer models. We then use the large-scale HMDA dataset and show that various models trained on HMDA demonstrate drift and FEAMOE can ably handle these drifts with respect to all the considered fairness measures and maintain model accuracy. We also prove that the proposed framework allows for producing fast Shapley value explanations, which makes computationally efficient feature attribution based explanations of model decisions readily available via FEAMOE",

    "abstract": "Language models are known to be vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks, which add human-imperceptible perturbations to the input to mislead DNNs. It is thus imperative to devise effective attack algorithms to identify the deficiencies of DNNs before real-world deployment. However, existing word-level attacks have two major deficiencies: (1) They may change the semantics of the original sentence. (2) The generated adversarial sample can appear unnatural to humans due to the introduction of out-of-domain substitute words. In this paper, to address such drawbacks, we propose a semantics- and domain-aware word-level attack method. Specifically, we greedily replace the important words in a sentence with the ones suggested by a language model. The language model is trained to be semantics- and domain-aware via contrastive learning and in-domain pre-training. Furthermore, to balance the quality of adversarial examples and the attack success rate, we propose an iterative updating framework to optimize the contrastive learning loss and the in-domain pre-training loss in circular order. Comprehensive experimental comparisons confirm the superiority of our approach. Notably, compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, our strategy can achieve over 3\\% improvement in attack success rates and 9.8\\% improvement in the quality of adversarial examples",

    "title": "Tracking Different Ant Species: An Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework and a Dataset for Multi-object Tracking",
    "abstract": "Tracking individuals is a vital part of many experiments conducted to understand collective behaviour. Ants are the paradigmatic model system for such experiments but their lack of individually distinguishing visual features and their high colony densities make it extremely difficult to perform reliable racking automatically. Additionally, the wide diversity of their species'  appearances makes a generalized approach even harder. In this paper, we propose a data-driven multi-object tracker that, for the first time, employs domain adaptation to achieve the required generalisation. This approach is built upon a joint-detection-and-tracking framework that is extended by a set of domain discriminator modules integrating an adversarial training strategy in addition to the tracking loss. In addition to this novel domain-adaptive tracking framework, we present a new dataset and a benchmark for the ant tracking problem. The dataset contains 57 video sequences with full trajectory annotation, including 30k frames captured from two different ant species moving on different background patterns. It comprises 33 and 24 sequences for source and target domains, respectively. We compare our proposed framework against other domain-adaptive and non-domain-adaptive multi-object tracking baselines using this dataset and show that incorporating domain adaptation at multiple levels of the tracking pipeline yields significant improvements.

    "abstract": "Text-based person search aims to retrieve the specified person images given a textual description. The key to tackling such a challenging task is to learn powerful multi-modal representations. Towards this, we propose a Relation and Sensitivity aware representation learning method (RaSa), including two novel tasks: Relation-Aware learning (RA) and Sensitivity-Aware learning (SA). For one thing, existing methods cluster representations of all positive pairs without distinction and overlook the noise problem caused by the weak positive pairs where the text and the paired image have noise correspondences, thus leading to overfitting learning. RA offsets the overfitting risk by introducing a novel positive relation detection task (i.e., learning to distinguish strong and weak positive pairs). For another thing, learning invariant representation under data augmentation (i.e., being insensitive to some transformations) is a general practice for improving representation's robustness in existing methods. Beyond that, we encourage the representation to perceive the sensitive transformation by SA (i.e., learning to detect the replaced words), thus promoting the representation's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that RaSa outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 6.94%, 4.45% and 15.35% in terms of Rank@1 on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid datasets, respectively.

Meanwhile, there is an increasing demand for single image super-resolution with arbitrary scale factors in real-world scenarios. Many approaches adopt scale-specific multi-path learning to cope with multi-scale super-resolution with a single network. However, these methods require a large number of parameters. To achieve a better balance between the reconstruction quality and parameter amounts, we proposes a learnable interpolation method that leverages the advantages of neural networks and interpolation methods to tackle the scale-arbitrary super-resolution task. The scale factor is treated as a function parameter for generating the kernel weights for the learnable interpolation. We demonstrate that the learnable interpolation builds a bridge between neural networks and traditional interpolation methods. Experiments show that the proposed learnable interpolation requires much fewer parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art super-resolution methods",

    "abstract": "Human pose estimation is a challenging task due to its structured data sequence nature. Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction of body joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping joints and rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel approach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverages high-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation. Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-order attention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitates first-order \"joint-joint\", second-order \"bone-joint\", and high-order \"hyperbone-joint\" interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavy situations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into the transformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance and efficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parameters and significantly lower computational costs. Moreover, HDFormer demonstrates broad real-world applicability, enabling real-time, accurate 3D pose estimation. The source code is in https://github.com/hyer/HDFormer",

    "abstract": "Most infrared small target detection (ISTD) networks focus on building effective neural blocks or feature fusion modules but none describes the ISTD process from the image evolution perspective. The directional evolution of image pixels influenced by convolution, pooling and surrounding pixels is analogous to the movement of fluid elements constrained by surrounding variables ang particles. Inspired by this, we explore a novel research routine by abstracting the movement of pixels in the ISTD process as the flow of fluid in fluid dynamics (FD). Specifically, a new Fluid Dynamics-Inspired Network (FDI-Net) is devised for ISTD. Based on Taylor Central Difference (TCD) method, the TCD feature extraction block is designed, where convolution and Transformer structures are combined for local and global information. The pixel motion equation during the ISTD process is derived from the Navier–Stokes (N-S) equation, constructing a N-S Refinement Module that refines extracted features with edge details. Thus, the TCD feature extraction block determines the primary movement direction of pixels during detection, while the N-S Refinement Module corrects some skewed directions of the pixel stream to supplement the edge details. Experiments on IRSTD-1k and SIRST demonstrate that our method achieves SOTA performance in terms of evaluation metrics",

To handle the issue, we aim to involve Transformer into cost aggregation. However, another problem may occur due to the quadratically growing computational complexity caused by Transformer, resulting in memory overflow and inference latency. In this paper, we overcome these limits with an efficient Transformer-based cost aggregation network, namely CostFormer. The Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer(RDACT) is proposed to aggregate long-range features on cost volume via self-attention mechanisms along the depth and spatial dimensions.

    "abstract": "The performance of existing supervised neuron segmentation methods is highly dependent on the number of accurate annotations, especially when applied to large scale electron microscopy (EM) data. By extracting semantic information from unlabeled data, self-supervised methods can improve the performance of downstream tasks, among which the mask image model (MIM) has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in recovering original information from masked images. However, due to the high degree of structural locality in EM images, as well as the existence of considerable noise, many voxels contain little discriminative information, making MIM pretraining inefficient on the neuron segmentation task. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decision-based MIM that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically search for optimal image masking ratio and masking strategy. Due to the vast exploration space, using single-agent RL for voxel prediction is impractical. Therefore, we treat each input patch as an agent with a shared behavior policy, allowing for multi-agent collaboration. Furthermore, this multi-agent model can capture dependencies between voxels, which is beneficial for the downstream segmentation task. Experiments conducted on representative EM datasets demonstrate that our approach has a significant advantage over alternative self-supervised methods on the task of neuron segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called CIG based on controllable image generation to directly tackle these two issues. Our main idea is to generate extra training samples with specific labels near category boundaries, and the sample generation is biased toward the less-represented categories. To achieve controllable image generation, we seek to separate structural and categorical information of images based on structural similarity, categorical similarity, and reconstruction constraints. We evaluate the effectiveness of our new CIG approach in three different image ordinal regression scenarios. The results demonstrate that CIG can be flexibly integrated with off-the-shelf image encoders or ordinal regression models to achieve improvement, and further, the improvement is more significant for minority categories",

In this context, we build Win-win Cooperation (WiCo) to exploit complementary nature of two types of methods on both interaction and integration aspects for achieving a win-win improvement. For the interaction aspect, Complementary Feature Interaction (CFI) introduces prior object information to bottom-up branch and provides fine-grained information to top-down branch for complementary feature enhancement.

In recent years, owing to the strong ability of self-attention in capturing long-range dependencies, Transformer based methods have achieved promising performance on multifarious image restoration tasks. However, the canonical self-attention leads to quadratic complexity with respect to input size, hindering its further applications in image restoration.

Specifically, a strip attention unit is proposed to harvest the contextual information for each pixel from its adjacent pixels in the same row or column. By employing this operation in different directions, each location can perceive information from an expanded region. Furthermore, we apply various receptive fields in different feature groups to enhance representation learning.

RZCR consists of a visual semantic fusion-based radical information extractor (RIE) and a knowledge graph character reasoner (KGR). RIE aims to recognize candidate radicals and their possible structural relations from character images in parallel.

In this paper, we propose the illumination-coupled domain adaptation framework(ICDA) to effectively avoid the illumination gap and mitigate the dataset gap by coupling daytime and nighttime images as a whole with semantic relevance. Specifically, we first design a new composite enhancement method(CEM) that considers not only illumination but also spatial consistency to construct the source and target domain pairs, which provides the basic adaptation unit for our ICDA. Next, to avoid the illumination gap, we devise the Deformable Attention Relevance(DAR) module to capture the semantic relevance inside each domain pair, which can couple the daytime and nighttime images at the feature level and adaptively guide the predictions of nighttime images. Besides, to mitigate the dataset gap and acquire domain-invariant semantic relevance, we propose the Prototype-based Class Alignment(PCA) module, which improves the usage of category information and performs fine-grained alignment.

    "title": "Timestamp-Supervised Action Segmentation from the Perspective of Clustering",
    "abstract": "Video action segmentation under timestamp supervision has recently received much attention due to lower annotation costs. Most existing methods generate pseudo-labels for all frames in each video to train the segmentation model. However, these methods suffer from incorrect pseudo-labels, especially for the semantically unclear frames in the transition region between two consecutive actions, which we call ambiguous intervals. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework from the perspective of clustering, which includes the following two parts. First, pseudo-label ensembling generates incomplete but high-quality pseudo-label sequences, where the frames in ambiguous intervals have no pseudo-labels. Second, iterative clustering iteratively propagates the pseudo-labels to the ambiguous intervals by clustering, and thus updates the pseudo-label sequences to train the model. We further introduce a clustering loss, which encourages the features of frames within the same action segment more compact. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our method",

    "title": "LION: Label Disambiguation for Semi-supervised Facial Expression Recognition with Progressive Negative Learning",
    "abstract": "Semi-supervised deep facial expression recognition (SS-DFER) has recently attracted rising research interest due to its more practical setting of abundant unlabeled data. However, there are two main problems unconsidered in current SS-DFER methods: 1) label ambiguity, i.e., given labels mismatch with facial expressions; 2) inefficient utilization of unlabeled data with low-confidence. In this paper, we propose a novel SS-DFER method, including a Label DIsambiguation module and a PrOgressive Negative Learning module, namely LION, to simultaneously address both problems. Specifically, the label disambiguation module operates on labeled data, including data with accurate labels (clear data) and ambiguous labels (ambiguous data). It first uses clear data to calculate prototypes for all the expression classes, and then re-assign a candidate label set to all the ambiguous data. Based on the prototypes and the candidate label set, the ambiguous data can be relabeled more accurately. As for unlabeled data with low-confidence, the progressive negative learning module is developed to iteratively mine more complete complementary labels, which can guide the model to reduce the association between data and corresponding complementary labels. Experiments on three challenging datasets show that our method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in SS-DFER and surpasses fully-supervised baselines.

    "title": "Improve Video Representation with Temporal Adversarial Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Recent works reveal that adversarial augmentation benefits the generalization of neural networks (NNs) if used in an appropriate manner. In this paper, we introduce Temporal Adversarial Augmentation (TA), a novel video augmentation technique that utilizes temporal attention. Unlike conventional adversarial augmentation, TA is specifically designed to shift the attention distributions of neural networks with respect to video clips by maximizing a temporal-related loss function. We demonstrate that TA will obtain diverse temporal views, which significantly affect the focus of neural networks. Training with these examples remedies the flaw of unbalanced temporal information perception and enhances the ability to defend against temporal shifts, ultimately leading to better generalization. To leverage TA, we propose Temporal Video Adversarial Fine-tuning (TAF) framework for improving video representations. TAF is a model-agnostic, generic, and interpretability-friendly training strategy. We evaluate TAF with four powerful models (TSM, GST, TAM, and TPN) over three challenging temporal-related benchmarks (Something-something V1&V2 and diving48). Experimental results demonstrate that TAF effectively improves the test accuracy of these models with notable margins without introducing additional parameters or computational costs. As a byproduct, TAF also improves the robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. Code is available at https://github.com/jinhaoduan/TAF",

    "abstract": "Glass-like objects are widespread in daily life but remain intractable to be segmented for most existing methods. The transparent property makes it difficult to be distinguished from background, while the tiny separation boundary further impedes the acquisition of their exact contour. In this paper, by revealing the key co-evolution demand of semantic and boundary learning, we propose a Selective Mutual Evolution (SME) module to enable the reciprocal feature learning between them. Then to exploit the global shape context, we propose a Structurally Attentive Refinement (SAR) module to conduct a fine-grained feature refinement for those ambiguous points around the boundary. Finally, to further utilize the multi-scale representation, we integrate the above two modules into a cascaded structure and then introduce a Reciprocal Feature Evolution Network (RFENet) for effective glass-like object segmentation.

The main contribution is based on an interesting finding of the significant existence of the middle frequency sub-band during the CNN process. Consequently, a Sub-Band based Attention (SBA) module is proposed, which uniformly adopts either the high or middle sub-bands of the encoder features to boost the decoder features and thus concretely improve the feature discrimination. A strong encoder supplying informative sub-bands is also very important, while we highly value the local-and-global information enriched CNN features. Therefore, a Transformer Attended Convolution (TAC) module as the main encoder block is introduced. It takes the Transformer features to boost the CNN features with stronger long-range object contexts. The combination of SBA and TAC leads to a novel polyp segmentation framework, SBA-Net. It adopts TAC to effectively obtain encoded features which also input to SBA, so that efficient sub-bands based attention maps can be generated for progressively decoding the bottleneck features. Consequently, SBA-Net can achieve the robust polyp segmentation, as the experimental results demonstrate",

Taking inspiration from Bézier decomposition on NURBS models, we transfer it to guide point cloud segmentation casting off primitive types. A joint optimization framework is proposed to learn Bézier primitive segmentation and geometric fitting simultaneously on a cascaded architecture.

We also introduce a reconstruction module where we successfully process multiple CAD models with different primitives simultaneously.

    "abstract": "There are two problems that widely exist in current end-to-end sign language processing architecture. One is the CTC spike phenomenon which weakens the visual representational ability in Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR). The other one is the exposure bias problem which leads to the accumulation of translation errors during inference in  Sign Language Translation (SLT). In this paper, we tackle these issues by introducing contrast learning, aiming to enhance both visual-level feature representation and semantic-level error tolerance. Specifically, to alleviate CTC spike phenomenon and enhance visual-level representation, we design a visual contrastive loss by minimizing visual feature distance between different augmented samples of frames in one sign video, so that the model can further explore features by utilizing numerous unlabeled frames in an unsupervised way. To alleviate exposure bias problem and improve semantic-level error tolerance, we design a semantic contrastive loss by re-inputting the predicted sentence into semantic module and comparing features of ground-truth sequence  and predicted sequence, for exposing model to its own mistakes. Besides, we propose two new metrics, i.e., Blank Rate and Consecutive Wrong Word Rate to directly reflect our improvement on the two problems.

Large and complex search spaces with versatile building operators and structures provide more opportunities to brew promising architectures, yet pose severe challenges on efficient exploration and exploitation. Subsequently, several search space shrinkage methods optimize by selecting a single sub-region that contains some well-performing networks.  Small performance and efficiency gains are observed with these methods but such techniques leave room for significantly improved search performance and are ineffective at retaining architectural diversity. We propose LISSNAS, an automated algorithm that shrinks a large space into a diverse, small search space with SOTA search performance. Our approach leverages locality, the relationship between structural and performance similarity, to efficiently extract many pockets of well-performing networks. We showcase our method on an array of search spaces spanning various sizes and datasets. We accentuate the effectiveness of our shrunk spaces when used in one-shot search by achieving the best Top-1 accuracy in two different search spaces.

    "abstract": "Scene text image super-resolution (STISR), aiming to improve image quality while boosting downstream scene text recognition accuracy, has recently achieved great success. However, most existing methods treat the foreground (character regions) and background (non-character regions) equally in the forward process, and neglect the disturbance from the complex background, thus limiting the performance. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method LEMMA that explicitly models character regions to produce high-level text-specific guidance for super-resolution. To model the location of characters effectively, we propose the location enhancement module to extract character region features based on the attention map sequence. Besides, we propose the multi-modal alignment module to perform bidirectional visual-semantic alignment to generate high-quality prior guidance, which is then incorporated into the super-resolution branch in an adaptive manner using the proposed adaptive fusion module.

    "abstract": "Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promising performance in self-supervised learning for both 2D and 3D computer vision. However, existing MAE-style methods can only learn from the data of a single modality, i.e., either images or point clouds, which neglect the implicit semantic and geometric correlation between 2D and 3D. In this paper, we explore how the 2D modality can benefit 3D masked autoencoding, and propose Joint-MAE, a 2D-3D joint MAE framework for self-supervised 3D point cloud pre-training. Joint-MAE randomly masks an input 3D point cloud and its projected 2D images, and then reconstructs the masked information of the two modalities. For better cross-modal interaction, we construct our JointMAE by two hierarchical 2D-3D embedding modules, a joint encoder, and a joint decoder with modal-shared and model-specific decoders. On top of this, we further introduce two cross-modal strategies to boost the 3D representation learning, which are local-aligned attention mechanisms for 2D-3D semantic cues, and a cross-reconstruction loss for 2D-3D geometric constraints. By our pre-training paradigm, Joint-MAE achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, e.g., 92.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40 and 86.07% accuracy on the hardest split of ScanObjectNN",

    "abstract": "Recently, numerous studies have been conducted on supervised learning-based image denoising methods. However, these methods rely on large-scale noisy-clean image pairs, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Denoising methods with self-supervised training that can be trained with only noisy images have been proposed to address the limitation. These methods are based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown promising performance. However, CNN-based methods do not consider using nonlocal self-similarities essential in the traditional method, which can cause performance limitations. This paper presents self-similarity attention (SS-Attention), a novel self-attention module that can capture nonlocal self-similarities to solve the problem. We focus on designing a lightweight self-attention module in a pixel-wise manner, which is nearly impossible to implement using the classic self-attention module due to the quadratically increasing complexity with spatial resolution. Furthermore, we integrate SS-Attention into the blind-spot network called self-similarity-based blind-spot network (SS-BSN). We conduct the experiments on real-world image denoising tasks. The proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in self-supervised denoising on the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) and Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) benchmark datasets",

In practice, however, the obtained features is often mixed with domain-specific information which causes performance degradation. To overcome this fundamental limitation, this article presents a novel independent feature decomposition and instance alignment method (IndUDA in short). Specifically, based on an invertible flow, we project the base features into a decomposed latent space with domain-invariant and domain-specific dimensions. To drive semantic decomposition independently, we then swap the domain-invariant part across source and target domain samples with the same category and require their inverted features are consistent in class-level with the original features.  By treating domain-specific information as noise, we replace it by Gaussian noise and further regularize source model training by instance alignment, i.e., requiring the base features close to the corresponding reconstructed features, respectively.

A prominent direction to reduce the cost is to learn with noisy labels, which are ubiquitous in the real-world applications. A critical challenge for such a learning task is to reduce the effect of network memorization on the falsely-labeled data.  In this work, we propose an iterative selection approach based on the Weibull mixture model, which identifies clean data by considering the overall learning dynamics of each data instance. In contrast to the previous small-loss heuristics, we leverage the observation that deep network is easy to memorize and hard to forget clean data. In particular, we measure the difficulty of memorization and forgetting for each instance via the transition times between being misclassified and being memorized in training, and integrate them into a novel metric for selection. Based on the proposed metric, we retain a subset of identified clean data and repeat the selection procedure to iteratively refine the clean subset, which is finally used for model training. To validate our method, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic noisy datasets and real-world web data, and our strategy outperforms existing noisy-label learning methods",

Existing video-and-language learning models commonly sample multiple frames for training instead of observing all. These sampled deputies greatly improve computational efficiency, but do they represent the original video content enough with no more redundancy? In this work, we propose a dual video summarization framework and verify it in the context of video captioning. Given the video frames, we firstly extract the visual representation based on the ViT model fine-tuned on the video-text domain. Then we summarize the keyframes according to the frame-lever score.  To compress the number of keyframes as much as possible while ensuring the quality of captioning, we learn a cross-modal video summarizer to select the most semantically consistent frames according to the pseudo score label. Top K frames ( K is no more than 3% of the entire video.) are chosen to form the video representation. Moreover, to evaluate the static appearance and temporal information of video, we design the ranking scheme of video representation from two aspects: feature-oriented and sequence-oriented. Finally, we generate the descriptions with a lightweight LSTM decoder. The experiment results on the MSR-VTT and MSVD dataset reveal that, for the generative task as video captioning, a small number of keyframes can convey the same semantic information to perform well on captioning, or even better than the original sampling",

    "title": "Part Aware Contrastive Learning for Self-Supervised Action Recognition",
    "abstract": "In recent years, remarkable results have been achieved in self-supervised action recognition using skeleton sequences with contrastive learning. It has been observed that the semantic distinction of human action features is often represented by local body parts, such as legs or hands, which are advantageous for skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the entire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR learns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment results demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity significantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed SkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and PKU-MMD datasets.

In this paper, we propose an Audio-Queried Transformer architecture, AQFormer, where we define a set of object queries conditioned on audio information and associate each of them to particular sounding objects. Explicit object-level semantic correspondence between audio and visual modalities is established by gathering object information from visual features with predefined audio queries. Besides, an Audio-Bridged Temporal Interaction module is proposed to exchange sounding object-relevant information among multiple frames with the bridge of audio features.

To achieve intra-domain adaptation, we first introduce a pseudo-label aggregation based on the intra-domain optimal transport to help the model align the feature distribution of unlabeled target samples and the prototype. At the inter-domain level, we propose a cross-domain alignment loss to help the model use the target prototype for cross-domain knowledge transfer.

To realize more comprehensive visual-linguistic interaction, we propose to enrich phrases with coupled pixel and object contexts by designing a Phrase-Pixel-Object Transformer Decoder (PPO-TD), where both fine-grained part details and coarse-grained entity clues are aggregated to phrase features. In addition, we also propose a Phrase-Object Contrastive Loss (POCL) to pull closer the matched phrase-object pairs and push away unmatched ones for aggregating more precise object contexts from more phrase-relevant object tokens. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark show our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance with large margins",

    "abstract": "Most existing ultra-high resolution (UHR) segmentation methods always struggle in the dilemma of balancing memory cost and local characterization accuracy, which are both taken into account in our proposed Guided Patch-Grouping Wavelet Transformer (GPWFormer) that achieves impressive performances. In this work, GPWFormer is a Transformer (T)-CNN (C) mutual leaning framework, where T takes the whole UHR image as input and harvests both local details and fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies, while C takes downsampled image as input for learning the category-wise deep context. For the sake of high inference speed and low computation complexity, T partitions the original UHR image into patches and groups them dynamically, then learns the low-level local details with the lightweight multi-head Wavelet Transformer (WFormer) network. Meanwhile, the fine-grained long-range contextual dependencies are also captured during this process, since patches that are far away in the spatial domain can also be assigned to the same group. In addition, masks produced by C are utilized to guide the patch grouping process, providing a heuristics decision. Moreover, the congruence constraints between the two branches are also exploited to maintain the spatial consistency among the patches. Overall, we stack the multi-stage process in a pyramid way. Experiments show that GPWFormer outperforms the existing methods with significant improvements on five benchmark datasets",

Current methods either fail to leverage the local details or are computationally expensive. What's worse, they fail to leverage the heterogeneous concepts in data. In this paper, we propose the Disentangled Conceptualization and Set-to-set Alignment (DiCoSA) to simulate the conceptualizing and reasoning process of human beings. For disentangled conceptualization, we divide the coarse feature into multiple latent factors related to semantic concepts. For set-to-set alignment, where a set of visual concepts correspond to a set of textual concepts, we propose an adaptive pooling method to aggregate semantic concepts to address the partial matching. In particular, since we encode concepts independently in only a few dimensions, DiCoSA is superior at efficiency and granularity, ensuring fine-grained interactions using a similar computational complexity as coarse-grained alignment.

    "abstract": "Incorporating physics in human motion capture to avoid artifacts like floating, foot sliding, and ground penetration is a promising direction. Existing solutions always adopt kinematic results as reference motions, and the physics is treated as a post-processing module. However, due to the depth ambiguity, monocular motion capture inevitably suffers from noises, and the noisy reference often leads to failure for physics-based tracking. To address the obstacles, our key-idea is to employ physics as denoising guidance in the reverse diffusion process to reconstruct physically plausible human motion from a modeled pose probability distribution. Specifically, we first train a latent gaussian model that encodes the uncertainty of 2D-to-3D lifting to facilitate reverse diffusion. Then, a physics module is constructed to track the motion sampled from the distribution. The discrepancies between the tracked motion and image observation are used to provide explicit guidance for the reverse diffusion model to refine the motion. With several iterations, the physics-based tracking and kinematic denoising promote each other to generate a physically plausible human motion. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous physics-based methods in both joint accuracy and success rate.

    "title": "SWAT: Spatial Structure Within and Among Tokens",
    "abstract": "Modeling visual data as tokens (i.e., image patches) using attention mechanisms, feed-forward networks or convolutions has been highly effective in recent years. Such methods usually have a common pipeline: a tokenization method, followed by a set of layers/blocks for information mixing, both within and among tokens. When image patches are converted into tokens, they are often flattened, discarding the spatial structure within each patch. As a result, any processing that follows (eg: multi-head self-attention) may fail to recover and/or benefit from such information. In this paper, we argue that models can have significant gains when spatial structure is preserved during tokenization, and is explicitly used during the mixing stage. We propose two key contributions: (1) Structure-aware Tokenization and, (2) Structure-aware Mixing, both of which can be combined with existing models with minimal effort. We introduce a family of models (SWAT), showing improvements over the likes of DeiT, MLP-Mixer and Swin Transformer, across multiple benchmarks including ImageNet classification and ADE20K segmentation.

In this work, to address the student model's limitation, we propose a novel flexible KD framework, Integrating Matched Features using Attentive Logit in Knowledge Distillation (IMF). Our approach introduces an intermediate feature distiller (IFD) to improve the overall performance of the student model by directly distilling the teacher's knowledge into branches of student models. The generated output of IFD, which is trained by the teacher model, is effectively combined by attentive logit. We use only a few blocks of the student and the trained IFD during inference, requiring an equal or less number of parameters.

Our study is motivated by the limitations of current Text2Image attacking approaches that still rely on manual trials to create adversarial prompts. To address such limitations, we develop CharGrad, a character-level gradient based attacking framework that replaces specific characters of a prompt with pixel-level similar ones by interactively learning the perturbation direction for the prompt and updating the attacking examiner for the generated image based on a novel proxy perturbation representation for characters.  We evaluate CharGrad using the texts from two public image captioning datasets. Results demonstrate that CharGrad outperforms existing text adversarial attacking approaches on attacking various subjects of generated images by black-box Text2Image models in a more effective and efficient way with less perturbation on the characters of the prompts",

To alleviate this problem, recent researchers build connections between support and query instances through embedding patch features to generate discriminative representations. However, we observe that there exists semantic mismatches (foreground/ background) among these local patches, because the location and size of the target object are not fixed. What is worse, these mismatches result in unreliable similarity confidences, and complex dense connection exacerbates the problem. According to this, we propose a novel Clustered-patch Element Connection (CEC) layer to correct the mismatch problem. The CEC layer leverages Patch Cluster and Element Connection operations to collect and establish reliable connections with high similarity patch features, respectively. Moreover, we propose a CECNet, including CEC layer based attention module and distance metric. The former is utilized to generate a more discriminative representation benefiting from the global clustered-patch features, and the latter is introduced to reliably measure the similarity between pair-features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CECNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on classification benchmark.

    "abstract": "Recently, MLP-based architectures achieved impressive results in image classification against CNNs and ViTs. However, there is an obvious limitation in that their parameters are related to image sizes, allowing them to process only fixed image sizes. Therefore, they cannot directly adapt dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) where images are of various sizes. Recent methods tried to address it but brought two new problems, long-range dependencies or important visual cues are ignored. This paper presents a new MLP-based architecture, Region-aware MLP (RaMLP), to satisfy various vision tasks and address the above three problems. In particular, we propose a well-designed module, Region-aware Mixing (RaM). RaM captures important local information and further aggregates these important visual clues. Based on RaM, RaMLP achieves a global receptive field even in one block. It is worth noting that, unlike most existing MLP-based architectures that adopt the same spatial weights to all samples, RaM is region-aware and adaptively determines weights to extract region-level features better. Impressively, our RaMLP outperforms state-of-the-art ViTs, CNNs, and MLPs on both ImageNet-1K image classification and downstream dense prediction tasks, including MS-COCO object detection, MS-COCO instance segmentation, and ADE20K semantic segmentation. In particular, RaMLP outperforms MLPs by a large margin (around 1.5% Apb or 1.0% mIoU) on dense prediction tasks. The training code could be found at https://github.com/xiaolai-sqlai/RaMLP",

    "title": "Deep Unfolding Convolutional Dictionary Model for Multi-Contrast MRI Super-resolution and Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tasks often involve multiple contrasts. Recently, numerous deep learning-based multi-contrast MRI super-resolution (SR) and reconstruction methods have been proposed to explore the complementary information from the multi-contrast images. However, these methods either construct parameter-sharing networks or manually design fusion rules, failing to accurately model the correlations between multi-contrast images and lacking certain interpretations. In this paper, we propose a multi-contrast convolutional dictionary (MC-CDic) model under the guidance of the optimization algorithm with a well-designed data fidelity term. Specifically, we bulid an observation model for the multi-contrast MR images to explicitly model the multi-contrast images as common features and unique features. In this way, only the useful information in the reference image can be transferred to the target image, while the inconsistent information will be ignored. We employ the proximal gradient algorithm to optimize the model and unroll the iterative steps into a deep CDic model. Especially, the proximal operators are replaced by learnable ResNet. In addition, multi-scale dictionaries are introduced to further improve the model performance. We test our MC-CDic model on multi-contrast MRI SR and reconstruction tasks.

    "abstract": "The hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer are very popular for medical image segmentation. However, it suffers from two challenges. First, although a CNNs branch can capture the local image features using vanilla convolution, it cannot achieve adaptive feature learning. Second, although a Transformer branch can capture the global features, it ignores the channel and cross-dimensional self-attention, resulting in a low segmentation accuracy on complex-content images. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid architecture of convolutional neural networks hand in hand with vision Transformers (CiT-Net) for medical image segmentation. Our network has two advantages. First, we design a dynamic deformable convolution and apply it to the CNNs branch, which overcomes the weak feature extraction ability due to fixed-size convolution kernels and the stiff design of sharing kernel parameters among different inputs. Second, we design a shifted-window adaptive complementary attention module and a compact convolutional projection. We apply them to the Transformer branch to learn the cross-dimensional long-term dependency for medical images. Experimental results show that our CiT-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than popular SOTA methods. Besides, our CiT-Net requires lower parameters and less computational costs and does not rely on pre-training. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/SR0920/CiT-Net",

However, these approaches tend to integrate global information in a large searching region, which neglect to focus on the most relevant information and induce blurry effect by the irrelevant textures. Some improved methods simply constrain self-attention in a local window to suppress the useless information. But it also limits the capability of recovering high-frequency details when flat areas dominate the local searching window. To improve the above issues, we propose a novel self-refinement mechanism which could adaptively achieve texture-aware reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine procedure. Generally, the primary self-attention is first conducted to reconstruct the coarse-grained textures and detect the fine-grained regions required further compensation. Then, region selection attention is performed to refine the textures on these key regions. Since self-attention considers the channel information on tokens equally, we employ a dual-branch feature integration module to privilege the important channels in feature extraction. Furthermore, we design the wavelet fusion module which integrate shallow-layer structure and deep-layer detailed feature to recover realistic face images in frequency domain.

To tackle the challenge, we introduce an intermediate variable for grasp contact areas to constrain the grasp generation; in other words, we factorize the mapping into two sequential stages by assuming that grasping poses are fully constrained given contact maps: 1) we first learn contact map distributions to generate the potential contact maps for grasps; 2) then learn a mapping from the contact maps to the grasping poses.

Although deep learning (DL)-based pan-sharpening methods have achieved promising performance, most of them have a two-fold deficiency. For one thing, the universally adopted black box principle limits the model interpretability. For another thing, existing DL-based methods fail to efficiently capture local and global dependencies at the same time, inevitably limiting the overall performance. To address these mentioned issues, we first formulate the degradation process of the high-resolution multispectral (HrMS) image as a unified variational optimization problem, and alternately solve its data and prior subproblems by the designed iterative proximal gradient descent (PGD) algorithm. Moreover, we customize a Local-Global Transformer (LGT) to simultaneously model local and global dependencies, and further formulate an LGT-based prior module for image denoising. Besides the prior module, we also design a lightweight data module. Finally, by serially integrating the data and prior modules in each iterative stage, we unfold the iterative algorithm into a stage-wise unfolding network, Local-Global Transformer Enhanced Unfolding Network (LGTEUN), for the interpretable MS pan-sharpening.

    "abstract": "Accurately perceiving instances and predicting their future motion are key tasks for autonomous vehicles, enabling them to navigate safely in complex urban traffic. While bird’s-eye view (BEV) representations are commonplace in perception for autonomous driving, their potential in a motion prediction setting is less explored. Existing approaches for BEV instance prediction from surround cameras rely on a multi-task auto-regressive setup coupled with complex post-processing to predict future instances in a spatio-temporally consistent manner. In this paper, we depart from this paradigm and propose an efficient novel end-to-end framework named PowerBEV, which differs in several design choices aimed at reducing the inherent redundancy in previous methods. First, rather than predicting the future in an auto-regressive fashion, PowerBEV uses a parallel, multi-scale module built from lightweight 2D convolutional networks. Second, we show that segmentation and centripetal backward flow are sufficient for prediction, simplifying previous multi-task objectives by eliminating redundant output modalities. Building on this output representation, we propose a simple, flow warping-based post-processing approach which produces more stable instance associations across time. Through this lightweight yet powerful design, PowerBEV outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on the NuScenes Dataset and poses an alternative paradigm for BEV instance prediction.

    "abstract": "Pre-training has marked numerous state of the arts in high-level computer vision, while few attempts have ever been made to investigate how pre-training acts in image processing systems. In this paper, we tailor transformer-based pre-training regimes that boost various low-level tasks. To comprehensively diagnose the influence of pre-training, we design a whole set of principled evaluation tools that uncover its effects on internal representations. The observations demonstrate that pre-training plays strikingly different roles in low-level tasks. For example, pre-training introduces more local information to intermediate layers in super-resolution (SR), yielding significant performance gains, while pre-training hardly affects internal feature representations in denoising, resulting in limited gains. Further, we explore different methods of pre-training, revealing that multi-related-task pre-training is more effective and data-efficient than other alternatives. Finally, we extend our study to varying data scales and model sizes, as well as comparisons between transformers and CNNs. Based on the study, we successfully develop state-of-the-art models for multiple low-level tasks",

    "title": "Compositional Zero-Shot Artistic Font Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Recently, many researchers have made remarkable achievements in the field of artistic font synthesis, with impressive glyph style and effect style in the results. However, due to less exploration in style disentanglement, it is difficult for existing methods to envision a kind of unseen style (glyph-effect) compositions of artistic font, and thus can only learn the seen style compositions. To solve this problem, we propose a novel compositional zero-shot artistic font synthesis gan (CAFS-GAN), which allows the synthesis of unseen style compositions by exploring the visual independence and joint compatibility of encoding semantics between glyph and effect. Specifically, we propose two contrast-based style encoders to achieve style disentanglement due to glyph and effect intertwining in the image. Meanwhile, to preserve more glyph and effect detail, we propose a generator based on hierarchical dual styles AdaIN to reorganize content-styles representations from structure to texture gradually. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating high-quality artistic font images with unseen style compositions against other state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "VS-Boost: Boosting Visual-Semantic Association for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Unlike conventional zero-shot learning (CZSL) which only focuses on the recognition of unseen classes by using the classifier trained on seen classes and semantic embeddings, generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims at recognizing both the seen and unseen classes, so it is more challenging due to the extreme training imbalance. Recently, some feature generation methods introduce metric learning to enhance the discriminability of visual features. Although these methods achieve good results, they focus only on metric learning in the visual feature space to enhance features and ignore the association between the feature space and the semantic space. Since the GZSL method uses semantics as prior knowledge to migrate visual knowledge to unseen classes, the consistency between visual space and semantic space is critical. To this end, we propose relational metric learning which can relate the metrics in the two spaces and make the distribution of the two spaces more consistent. Based on the generation method and relational metric learning, we proposed a novel GZSL method, termed VS-Boost, which can effectively boost the association between vision and semantics. The experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective and achieves significant gains on five benchmark datasets compared with the state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "SGAT4PASS: Spherical Geometry-Aware Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "As an important and challenging problem in computer vision, PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (PASS) gives complete scene perception based on an ultra-wide angle of view. Usually, prevalent PASS methods with 2D panoramic image input focus on solving image distortions but lack consideration of the 3D properties of original 360 degree data. Therefore, their performance will drop a lot when inputting panoramic images with the 3D disturbance. To be more robust to 3D disturbance, we propose our Spherical Geometry-Aware Transformer for PAnoramic Semantic Segmentation (SGAT4PASS), considering 3D spherical geometry knowledge. Specifically, a spherical geometry-aware framework is proposed for PASS. It includes three modules, i.e., spherical geometry-aware image projection, spherical deformable patch embedding, and a panorama-aware loss, which takes input images with 3D disturbance into account, adds a spherical geometry-aware constraint on the existing deformable patch embedding, and indicates the pixel density of original 360 degree data, respectively. Experimental results on Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets show that SGAT4PASS significantly improves performance and robustness, with approximately a 2% increase in mIoU, and when small 3D disturbances occur in the data, the stability of our performance is improved by an order of magnitude.

It always requires the source contents to be completely in front of the target contents or needs manual interventions to adjust occlusions, which is very tedious. Though several methods have suggested exploiting priors or learning techniques for promoting occlusion determination, their potentials are much limited. This paper addresses the challenge by presenting a depth registration method for merging the source contents seamlessly into the 3D space that the target image represents. Thus, the occlusions between the source contents and target contents can be conveniently handled through pixel-wise depth comparisons, allowing the user to more efficiently focus on the designs for image composition. Experimental results show that we can conveniently handle occlusions in image composition and improve efficiency by about 4 times compared to Photoshop",

    "title": "Complete Instances Mining for Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) using only image-level labels is a challenging task due to the difficulty of aligning coarse annotations with the finer task. However, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs), WSIS has garnered significant attention. Following a proposal-based paradigm, we encounter a redundant segmentation problem resulting from a single instance being represented by multiple proposals. For example, we feed a picture of a dog and proposals into the network and expect to output only one proposal containing a dog, but the network outputs multiple proposals. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for WSIS that focuses on the online refinement of complete instances through the use of MaskIoU heads to predict the integrity scores of proposals and a Complete Instances Mining (CIM) strategy to explicitly model the redundant segmentation problem and generate refined pseudo labels. Our approach allows the network to become aware of multiple instances and complete instances, and we further improve its robustness through the incorporation of an Anti-noise strategy. Empirical evaluations on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin.

    "title": "Analyzing and Combating Attribute Bias for Face Restoration",
    "abstract": "Face restoration (FR) recovers high resolution (HR) faces from low resolution (LR) faces and is challenging due to its ill-posed nature. With years of development, existing methods can produce quality HR faces with realistic details. However, we observe that key facial attributes (e.g., age and gender) of the restored faces could be dramatically different from the LR faces and call this phenomenon attribute bias, which is fatal when using FR for applications such as surveillance and security. Thus, we argue that FR should consider not only image quality as in existing works but also attribute bias. To this end, we thoroughly analyze attribute bias with extensive experiments and find that two major causes are the lack of attribute information in LR faces and bias in the training data. Moreover, we propose the DebiasFR framework to produce HR faces with high image quality and accurate facial attributes. The key design is to explicitly model the facial attributes, which also allows to adjust facial attributes for the output HR faces. Experiment results show that DebiasFR has comparable image quality but significantly smaller attribute bias when compared with state-of-the-art FR methods",

Specifically, we first graft a static scene graph generation model to generate static visual relationships within frames. Then we propose the temporal dependency model to extract the temporal dependencies across frames, and explicitly reassemble static visual relationships into dynamic scene graphs.

    "abstract": "Reliable pseudo labels from unlabeled data play a key role in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). However, the state-of-the-art SSOD methods all rely on pseudo labels with high confidence, which ignore valuable pseudo labels with lower confidence. Additionally, the insufficient excavation for unlabeled data results in an excessively low recall rate thus hurting the network training. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-confidence Samples Mining (LSM) method to utilize low confidence pseudo labels efficiently. Specifically, we develop an additional pseudo information mining (PIM) branch on account of low-resolution feature maps to extract reliable large area instances, the IoUs of which are higher than small area ones. Owing to the complementary predictions between PIM and the main branch, we further design self-distillation (SD) to compensate for both in a mutually learning manner. Meanwhile, the extensibility of the above approaches enables our LSM to apply to Faster-RCNN and Deformable-DETR respectively. On the MS-COCO benchmark, our method achieves 3.54% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art methods under 5% labeling ratios",

    "abstract": "Decision-based methods have shown to be effective in black-box adversarial attacks, as they can obtain satisfactory performance and only require to access the final model prediction. Gradient estimation is a critical step in black-box adversarial attacks, as it will directly affect the query efficiency. Recent works have attempted to utilize gradient priors to facilitate score-based methods to obtain better results. However, these gradient priors still suffer from the edge gradient discrepancy issue and the successive iteration gradient direction issue, thus are difficult to simply extend to decision-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Decision-based Black-box Attack framework with Gradient Priors (DBA-GP), which seamlessly integrates the data-dependent gradient prior and time-dependent prior into the gradient estimation procedure. First, by leveraging the joint bilateral filter to deal with each random perturbation, DBA-GP can guarantee that the generated perturbations in edge locations are hardly smoothed, i.e., alleviating the edge gradient discrepancy, thus remaining the characteristics of the original image as much as possible. Second, by utilizing a new gradient updating strategy to automatically adjust the successive iteration gradient direction, DBA-GP can accelerate the convergence speed, thus improving the query efficiency.

    "abstract": "For many driving safety applications, it is of great importance to accurately register LiDAR point clouds generated on distant moving vehicles. However, such point clouds have extremely different point density and sensor perspective on the same object, making registration on such point clouds very hard. In this paper, we propose a novel feature extraction framework, called APR, for online distant point cloud registration. Specifically, APR leverages an autoencoder design, where the autoencoder reconstructs a denser aggregated point cloud with several frames instead of the original single input point cloud. Our design forces the encoder to extract features with rich local geometry information based on one single input point cloud. Such features are then used for online distant point cloud registration. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art (SOTA) feature extractors on KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Results show that APR outperforms all other extractors by a large margin, increasing average registration recall of SOTA extractors by 7.1% on LoKITTI and 4.6% on LoNuScenes.

    "title": "Cross-Domain Facial Expression Recognition via Disentangling Identity Representation",
    "abstract": "Most existing cross-domain facial expression recognition (FER) works require target domain data to assist the model in analyzing distribution shifts to overcome negative effects. However, it is often hard to obtain expression images of the target domain in practical applications. Moreover, existing methods suffer from the interference of identity information, thus limiting the discriminative ability of the expression features. We exploit the idea of domain generalization (DG) and propose a representation disentanglement model to address the above problems. Specifically, we learn three independent potential subspaces corresponding to the domain, expression, and identity information from facial images. Meanwhile, the extracted expression and identity features are recovered as Fourier phase information reconstructed images, thereby ensuring that the high-level semantics of images remain unchanged after disentangling the domain information. Our proposed method can disentangle expression features from expression-irrelevant ones (i.e., identity and domain features). Therefore, the learned expression features exhibit sufficient domain invariance and discriminative ability. We conduct experiments with different settings on multiple benchmark datasets, and the results show that our method achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention",
    "abstract": "Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods",

    "abstract": "Object detection on panoramic/spherical images has been developed rapidly in the past few years, where IoU-calculator is a fundamental part of various detector components, i.e. Label Assignment, Loss and NMS. Due to the low efficiency and non-differentiability of spherical Unbiased IoU, spherical approximate IoU methods have been proposed recently. We find that the key of these approximate methods is to map spherical boxes to planar boxes. However, there exists two problems in these methods: (1) they do not eliminate the influence of panoramic image distortion; (2) they break the original pose between bounding boxes. They lead to the low accuracy of these methods. Taking the two problems into account, we propose a new sphere-plane boxes transform, called Sph2Pob. Based on the Sph2Pob, we propose (1) an differentiable IoU, Sph2Pob-IoU, for spherical boxes with low time-cost and high accuracy and (2) an agent Loss, Sph2Pob-Loss, for spherical detection with high flexibility and expansibility.

    "title": "Semantic-Aware Generation of Multi-View Portrait Drawings",
    "abstract": "Neural radiance fields (NeRF) based methods have shown amazing performance in synthesizing 3D-consistent photographic images, but fail to generate multi-view portrait drawings. The key is that the basic assumption of these methods -- a surface point is consistent when rendered from different views -- doesn't hold for drawings. In a portrait drawing, the appearance of a facial point may changes when viewed from different angles. Besides, portrait drawings usually present little 3D information and suffer from insufficient training data. To combat this challenge, in this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware GEnerator (SAGE) for synthesizing multi-view portrait drawings. Our motivation is that facial semantic labels are view-consistent and correlate with drawing techniques. We therefore propose to collaboratively synthesize multi-view semantic maps and the corresponding portrait drawings. To facilitate training, we design a semantic-aware domain translator, which generates portrait drawings based on features of photographic faces. In addition, use data augmentation via synthesis to mitigate collapsed results. We apply SAGE to synthesize multi-view portrait drawings in diverse artistic styles. Experimental results show that SAGE achieves significantly superior or highly competitive performance, compared to existing 3D-aware image synthesis methods.

    "title": "Dual Relation Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is an effective method for model compression. However, it is still a challenging topic to apply knowledge distillation to detection tasks. There are two key points resulting in poor distillation performance for detection tasks. One is the serious imbalance between foreground and background features, another one is that small object lacks enough feature representation. To solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual relation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation distillation and instance-wise relation distillation. The pixel-wise relation distillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph convolution to capture the global pixel relation. By distilling the global pixel relation, the student detector can learn the relation between foreground and background features, and avoid the difficulty of distilling features directly for the feature imbalance issue. Besides, we find that instance-wise relation supplements valuable knowledge beyond independent features for small objects. Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which calculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix. More importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable instance relations. The proposed dual relation knowledge distillation is general and can be easily applied for both one-stage and two-stage detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, which improves Faster R-CNN based on ResNet50 from 38.4% to 41.6% mAP and improves RetinaNet based on ResNet50 from 37.4% to 40.3% mAP on COCO 2017",

It synchronizes 3D proposal generation and center-ness score prediction by a parallel predictor without tedious hyper-parameters. To guide a task-aligned score ranking of proposals, a center-aware focal loss is proposed to supervise the training of the center-ness branch, which enhances the network's discriminative ability to distinguish proposals of different quality. Besides, we design a binary target classifier to identify target-relevant points. By integrating the derived classification scores with the center-ness scores, the resulting network can effectively suppress interference proposals and further mitigate task misalignment. Finally, we present a novel one-stage Siamese tracker OSP2B equipped with the designed network. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks including KITTI and Waymo SOT Dataset show that our OSP2B achieves leading performance with a considerable real-time speed",

    "title": "SLViT: Scale-Wise Language-Guided Vision Transformer for Referring Image Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Referring image segmentation aims to segment an object out of an image via a specific language expression. The main concept is establishing global visual-linguistic relationships to locate the object and identify boundaries using details of the image. Recently, various Transformer-based techniques have been proposed to efficiently leverage long-range cross-modal dependencies,  enhancing performance for referring segmentation. However, existing methods consider visual feature extraction and cross-modal fusion separately, resulting in insufficient visual-linguistic alignment in semantic space. In addition, they employ sequential structures and hence lack multi-scale information interaction. To address these limitations, we propose a Scale-Wise Language-Guided Vision Transformer (SLViT) with two appealing designs: (1) Language-Guided Multi-Scale Fusion Attention, a novel attention mechanism module for extracting rich local visual information and modeling global visual-linguistic relationships in an integrated manner. (2) An Uncertain Region Cross-Scale Enhancement module that can identify regions of high uncertainty using linguistic features and refine them via aggregated multi-scale features. We have evaluated our method on three benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that SLViT surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost.

    "abstract": "We study visual question answering in a setting where the answer has to be mined from a pool of relevant and irrelevant images given as a context. For such a setting, a model must first retrieve relevant images from the pool and answer the question from these retrieved images. We refer to this problem as retrieval-based visual question answering (or RETVQA in short). The RETVQA is distinctively different and more challenging than the traditionally-studied Visual Question Answering (VQA), where a given question has to be answered with a single relevant image in context. Towards solving the RETVQA task, we propose a unified Multi Image BART (MI-BART) that takes a question and retrieved images using our relevance encoder for free-form fluent answer generation. Further, we introduce the largest dataset in this space, namely RETVQA, which has the following salient features: multi-image and retrieval requirement for VQA, metadata-independent questions over a pool of heterogeneous images, expecting a mix of classification-oriented and open-ended generative answers. Our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 76.5% and a fluency of 79.3% on the proposed dataset, namely RETVQA and also outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.9% and 11.8% on the image segment of the publicly available WebQA dataset on the accuracy and fluency metrics, respectively",

    "abstract": "Multi-camera instance association, which identifies identical objects among multiple objects in multi-view images, is challenging due to several harsh constraints. To tackle this problem, most studies have employed CNNs as feature extractors but often fail under such harsh constraints. Inspired by Vision Transformer (ViT), we first develop a pure ViT-based framework for robust feature extraction through self-attention and residual connection. We then propose two novel methods to achieve robust feature learning. First, we introduce learnable pseudo 3D position embeddings (P3DEs) that represent the 3D location of an object in the world coordinate system, which is independent of the harsh constraints. To generate P3DEs, we encode the camera ID and the object's 2D position in the image using embedding tables. We then build a framework that trains P3DEs to represent an object's 3D position in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we also utilize joint patch generation (JPG). During patch generation, JPG considers an object and its surroundings as a single input patch to reinforce the relationship information between two features. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate that both ViT-P3DE and ViT-P3DE with JPG achieve state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperform existing works, especially when dealing with extremely harsh constraints",

This gives the student the best assistance in making up for his (or her) weaknesses and becoming a good one overall. Enlightened by this, we introduce the \"Teaching what you Should Teach\" strategy into a knowledge distillation framework, and propose a data-based distillation method named \"TST\" that searches for desirable augmented samples to assist in distilling more efficiently and rationally. To be specific, we design a neural network-based data augmentation module with priori bias to find out what meets the teacher's strengths but the student's weaknesses, by learning magnitudes and probabilities to generate suitable data samples. By training the data augmentation module and the generalized distillation paradigm alternately, a student model is learned with excellent generalization ability. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive comparative experiments on object recognition, detection, and segmentation tasks. The results on the CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, MS-COCO, and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on almost all teacher-student pairs.

    "abstract": "The problem of long-tailed recognition (LTR) has received attention in recent years due to the fundamental power-law distribution of objects in the real-world. Most recent works in LTR use softmax classifiers that are biased in that they correlate classifier norm with the amount of training data for a given class. In this work, we show that learning prototype classifiers addresses the biased softmax problem in LTR. Prototype classifiers can deliver promising results simply using Nearest-Class-Mean (NCM), a special case where prototypes are empirical centroids. We go one step further and propose to jointly learn prototypes by using distances to prototypes in representation space as the logit scores for classification. Further, we theoretically analyze the properties of Euclidean distance based prototype classifiers that lead to stable gradient-based optimization which is robust to outliers. To enable independent distance scales along each channel, we enhance Prototype classifiers by learning channel-dependent temperature parameters. Our analysis shows that prototypes learned by Prototype classifiers are better separated than empirical centroids. Results on four LTR benchmarks show that Prototype classifier outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Recent advanced Table Structure Recognition (TSR) models adopt image-to-text solutions to parse table structure. These methods can be formulated as image caption problem, i.e., input a single-table image and output table structure description in a specific text format, e.g., HTML. With the impressive success of Transformer in text generation tasks, these methods use Transformer architecture to predict HTML table text in an autoregressive manner. However, tables always emerge with a large variety of shapes and sizes. Autoregressive models usually suffer from the error accumulation problem as the length of predicted text increases, which results in unsatisfactory performance for large tables. In this paper, we propose a novel image-to-text based TSR method that relieves error accumulation problems and improves performance noticeably. At the core of our method is a cascaded two-step decoder architecture with the former decoder predicting HTML table row tags non-autoregressively and the latter predicting HTML table cell tags of each row in a semi-autoregressive manner. Compared with existing methods that predict HTML text autoregressively, the superiority of our row-to-cell progressive table parsing is twofold: (1) it generates an HTML tag sequence with a vertical-and-horizontal two-step `scanning', which better fits the inherent 2D structure of image data, (2) it performs substantially better for large tables (long sequence prediction) since it alleviates error accumulation problem specific to autoregressive models.

    "abstract": "The conventional lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) claims that there exists a sparse subnetwork within a dense neural network and a proper random initialization method, called the winning ticket, such that it can be trained from scratch to almost as good as the dense counterpart. Meanwhile, the research of LTH in vision transformers (ViTs) is scarcely evaluated. In this paper, we first show that the conventional winning ticket is hard to find at weight level of ViTs by existing methods. Then, we generalize the LTH for ViTs to input data consisting of image patches inspired by the input dependence of ViTs. That is, there exists a subset of input image patches such that a ViT can be trained from scratch by using only this subset of patches and achieve similar accuracy to the ViTs trained by using all image patches. We call this subset of input patches the winning tickets, which represent a significant amount of information in the input data. We use a ticket selector to generate the winning tickets based on the informativeness of patches for various types of ViT, including DeiT, LV-ViT, and Swin Transformers. The experiments show that there is a clear difference between the performance of models trained with winning tickets and randomly selected subsets, which verifies our proposed theory. We elaborate the analogical similarity between our proposed Data-LTH-ViTs and the conventional LTH for further verifying the integrity of our theory.

Specifically, we first propose a Discrepancy-Guided Encoder (DisGE) to extract forgery-sensitive visual patterns.

Besides, a Double-Head Reconstruction (DouHR) module is proposed to enhance genuine compact visual patterns in different granular spaces. Under DouHR, we further introduce a Discrepancy-Aggregation Detector (DisAD) to aggregate these genuine compact visual patterns, such that the forgery detection capability on unknown patterns can be improved.

To overcome the limitation, deep neural networks rely on various visual hints such as size, shade, and texture extracted from RGB information. However, we observe that if such hints are overly exploited, the network can be biased on RGB information without considering the comprehensive view. We propose a novel depth estimation model named RElative Depth Transformer (RED-T) that uses relative depth as guidance in self-attention. Specifically, the model assigns high attention weights to pixels of close depth and low attention weights to pixels of distant depth. As a result, the features of similar depth can become more likely to each other and thus less prone to misused visual hints. We show that the proposed model achieves competitive results in monocular depth estimation benchmarks and is less biased to RGB information. In addition, we propose a novel monocular depth estimation benchmark that limits the observable depth range during training in order to evaluate the robustness of the model for unseen depths",

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has shown great success in novel view synthesis due to its state-of-the-art quality and flexibility. However, NeRF requires dense input views (tens to hundreds) and a long training time (hours to days) for a single scene to generate high-fidelity images. Although using the voxel grids to represent the radiance field can significantly accelerate the optimization process, we observe that for sparse inputs, the voxel grids are more prone to overfitting to the training views and will have holes and floaters, which leads to artifacts. In this paper, we propose VGOS, an approach for fast (3-5 minutes) radiance field reconstruction from sparse inputs (3-10 views) to address these issues. To improve the performance of voxel-based radiance field in sparse input scenarios, we propose two methods: (a) We introduce an incremental voxel training strategy, which prevents overfitting by suppressing the optimization of peripheral voxels in the early stage of reconstruction. (b) We use several regularization techniques to smooth the voxels, which avoids degenerate solutions.

    "abstract": "Neural connectivity reconstruction aims to understand the function of biological reconstruction and promote basic scientific research. The intricate morphology and densely intertwined branches make it an extremely challenging task. Most previous best-performing methods adopt affinity learning or metric learning. Nevertheless, they either neglect to model explicit voxel semantics caused by implicit optimization or are hysteresis to spatial information. Furthermore, the inherent locality of 3D CNNs limits modeling long-range dependencies, leading to sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a coherent and unified Appearance Prompt Vision Transformer (APViT) to integrate affinity and metric learning to exploit the complementarity by learning long-range spatial dependencies. The proposed APViT enjoys several merits. First, the extension continuity-aware attention module aims at constructing hierarchical attention customized for neuron extensibility and slice continuity to learn instance voxel semantic context from a global perspective and utilize continuity priors to enhance voxel spatial awareness. Second, the appearance prompt modulator is responsible for leveraging voxel-adaptive appearance knowledge conditioned on affinity rich in spatial information to instruct instance voxel semantics, exploiting the potential of affinity learning to complement metric learning. Extensive experimental results on multiple challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our APViT achieves consistent improvements with huge flexibility under the same post-processing strategy",

    "abstract": "Reliable outlier detection is critical for real-world deployment of deep learning models. Although extensively studied, likelihoods produced by deep generative models have been largely dismissed as being impractical for outlier detection. First, deep generative model likelihoods are readily biased by low-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for correcting these biases are computationally expensive, or do not generalize well to complex, natural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a state-of-the-art deep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++. We show that biases in PixelCNN++ likelihoods arise primarily from predictions based on local dependencies. We propose two families of bijective transformations -- ``stirring'' and ``shaking'' -- which ameliorate low-level biases and isolate the contribution of long-range dependencies to PixelCNN++ likelihoods. These transformations are inexpensive and readily computed at evaluation time. We test our approaches extensively with five grayscale and six natural image datasets and show that they achieve or exceed state-of-the-art outlier detection, particularly on datasets with complex, natural images. We also show that our solutions work well with other types of generative models (generative flows and variational autoencoders) and that their efficacy is governed by each model's reliance on local dependencies.

Most existing approaches focus on the spatial-temporal neural network model design for learning movement patterns to reduce prediction errors. However, they usually do not strictly follow the temporal constraints in the inference stage. Even though a small Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) is achieved, some of the predicted poses are not temporal feasible solutions, which disobeys the continuity of the body movement. In this paper, we consider the temporal constrained feasible solutions for human pose forecasting, where the predicted poses of input historical poses are guaranteed to obey the temporal constraints strictly in the inference stage. Rather than direct supervision of the prediction in the original pose space, a temporal constrained subspace is explicitly learned and then followed by an inverse transformation to obtain the final predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale benchmarks, including Human3.6M, AMASS, and 3DPW. State-of-the-art performance has been achieved with the temporal constrained feasible solutions",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for learning calibrated uncertainties under domain shifts, considering the case where the source (training) distribution differs from the target (test) distribution. We detect such domain shifts through the use of a differentiable density ratio estimator and train it together with the task network, composing an adjusted softmax predictive form that concerns the domain shift. In particular, the density ratio estimator yields a density ratio that reflects the closeness of a target (test) sample to the source (training) distribution. We employ it to adjust the uncertainty of prediction in the task network. This idea of using the density ratio is based on the distributionally robust learning (DRL) framework, which accounts for the domain shift through adversarial risk minimization. We demonstrate that our proposed method generates calibrated uncertainties that benefit many downstream tasks, such as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). On these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncertainties to select confident pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show that the introduction of DRL leads to significant improvements in cross-domain performance.

Specifically, we set up three hierarchical embedding spaces that respectively model the states, the objects, and their compositions, which serve as three “experts” that can be combined in inference for more accurate predictions. We achieve this based on the recent success of large-scale pretrained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, which provides a strong initial knowledge of image-text relationships. To better adapt this knowledge to CZSL, we propose to learn three hierarchical prompts by explicitly fixing the unrelated word tokens in the three embedding spaces.

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a realistic but challenging task that requires an agent to locate the target region using verbal and visual cues. While significant advancements have been achieved recently, there are still two broad limitations: (1) The explicit information mining for significant guiding semantics concealed in both vision and language is still under-explored; (2) The previously structured map method provides the average historical appearance of visited nodes, while it ignores distinctive contributions of various images and potent information retention in the reasoning process. This work proposes a dual semantic-aware recurrent global-adaptive network (DSRG) to address the above problems. First, DSRG proposes an instruction-guidance linguistic module (IGL) and an appearance-semantics visual module (ASV) for boosting vision and language semantic learning respectively. For the memory mechanism, a global adaptive aggregation module (GAA) is devised for explicit panoramic observation fusion, and a recurrent memory fusion module (RMF) is introduced to supply implicit temporal hidden states. Extensive experimental results on the R2R and REVERIE datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing methods.

    "title": "Detecting Adversarial Faces Using Only Real Face Self-Perturbations",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks aim to disturb the functionality of a target system by adding specific noise to the input samples, bringing potential threats to security and robustness when applied to facial recognition systems. Although existing defense techniques achieve high accuracy in detecting some specific adversarial faces (adv-faces), new attack methods especially GAN-based attacks with completely different noise patterns circumvent them and reach a higher attack success rate. Even worse, existing techniques require attack data before implementing the defense, making it impractical to defend newly emerging attacks that are unseen to defenders. In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic generality of adv-faces and propose to generate pseudo adv-faces by perturbing real faces with three heuristically designed noise patterns. We are the first to train an adv-face detector using only real faces and their self-perturbations, agnostic to victim facial recognition systems, and agnostic to unseen attacks. By regarding adv-faces as out-of-distribution data, we then naturally introduce a novel cascaded system for adv-face detection, which consists of training data self-perturbations, decision boundary regularization, and a max-pooling-based binary classifier focusing on abnormal local color aberrations. Experiments conducted on LFW and CelebA-HQ datasets with eight gradient-based and two GAN-based attacks validate that our method generalizes to a variety of unseen adversarial attacks",

    "title": "Align, Perturb and Decouple: Toward Better Leverage of Difference Information for RSI Change Detection",
    "abstract": "Change detection is a widely adopted technique in remote sense imagery (RSI) analysis in the discovery of long-term geomorphic evolution. To highlight the areas of semantic changes, previous effort mostly pays attention to learning representative feature descriptors of a single image, while the difference information is either modeled with simple difference operations or implicitly embedded via feature interactions. Nevertheless, such difference modeling can be noisy since it suffers from non-semantic changes and lacks explicit guidance from image content or context. In this paper, we revisit the importance of feature difference for change detection in RSI, and propose a series of operations to fully exploit the difference information: Alignment, Perturbation and Decoupling (APD). Firstly, alignment leverages contextual similarity to compensate for the non-semantic difference in feature space. Next, a difference module trained with semantic-wise perturbation is adopted to learn more generalized change estimators, which reversely bootstraps feature extraction and prediction. Finally, a decoupled dual-decoder structure is designed to predict semantic changes in both content-aware and content-agnostic manners. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmarks of LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD and DSIFN-CD, demonstrating our proposed operations bring significant improvement and achieve competitive results under similar comparative conditions.

    "title": "Learning 3D Photography Videos via Self-supervised Diffusion on Single Images",
    "abstract": "3D photography renders a static image into a video with appealing 3D visual effects. Existing approaches typically first conduct monocular depth estimation, then render the input frame to subsequent frames with various viewpoints, and finally use an inpainting model to fill those missing/occluded regions. The inpainting model plays a crucial role in rendering quality, but it is normally trained on out-of-domain data. To reduce the training and inference gap, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion model as the inpainting module. Given a single input image, we automatically construct a training pair of the masked occluded image and the ground-truth image with random cycle rendering. The constructed training samples are closely aligned to the testing instances, without the need for data annotation. To make full use of the masked images, we designed a Masked Enhanced Block (MEB), which can be easily plugged into the UNet and enhance the semantic conditions. Towards real-world animation, we present a novel task: out-animation, which extends the space and time of input objects. Extensive experiments on real datasets show that our method achieves competitive results with existing SOTA methods",

    "title": "Dual-view Correlation Hybrid Attention Network for Robust Holistic Mammogram Classification",
    "abstract": "Mammogram image is important for breast cancer screening, and typically obtained in a dual-view form, i.e., cranio-caudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO), to provide complementary information for clinical decisions. However, previous methods mostly learn features from the two views independently, which violates the clinical knowledge and ignores the importance of dual-view correlation in the feature learning. In this paper, we propose a dual-view correlation hybrid attention network (DCHA-Net) for robust holistic mammogram classification. Specifically, DCHA-Net is carefully designed to extract and reinvent deep feature maps for the two views, and meanwhile to maximize the underlying correlations between them. A hybrid attention module, consisting of local relation and non-local attention blocks, is proposed to alleviate the spatial misalignment of the paired views in the correlation maximization. A dual-view correlation loss is introduced to maximize the feature similarity between corresponding strip-like regions with equal distance to the chest wall, motivated by the fact that their features represent the same breast tissues, and thus should be highly-correlated with each other. Experimental results on the two public datasets, i.e., INbreast and CBIS-DDSM, demonstrate that the DCHA-Net can well preserve and maximize feature correlations across views, and thus outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for classifying a whole mammogram as malignant or not",

    "title": "Accurate MRI Reconstruction via Multi-Domain Recurrent Networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become dominant in MRI reconstruction from undersampled k-space. However, most existing CNNs methods reconstruct the undersampled images either in the spatial domain or in the frequency domain, and neglecting the correlation between these two domains. This hinders the further reconstruction performance improvement. To tackle this issue, in this work, we propose a new multi-domain recurrent network (MDR-Net) with multi-domain learning (MDL) blocks as its basic units to reconstruct the undersampled MR image progressively. Specifically, the MDL block interactively processes the local spatial features and the global frequency information to facilitate complementary learning, leading to fine-grained features generation. Furthermore, we introduce an effective frequency-based loss to narrow the frequency spectrum gap, compensating for over-smoothness caused by the widely used spatial reconstruction loss. Extensive experiments on public fastMRI datasets demonstrate that our MDR-Net consistently outperforms other competitive methods and is able to provide more details",

    "title": "From Generation to Suppression: Towards Effective Irregular Glow Removal for Nighttime Visibility Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Most existing Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods are primarily designed to improve brightness in dark regions, which suffer from severe degradation in nighttime images. However, these methods have limited exploration in another major visibility damage, the glow effects in real night scenes. Glow effects are inevitable in the presence of artificial light sources and cause further diffused blurring when directly enhanced. To settle this issue, we innovatively consider the glow suppression task as learning physical glow generation via multiple scattering estimation according to the Atmospheric Point Spread Function (APSF). In response to the challenges posed by uneven glow intensity and varying source shapes, an APSF-based Nighttime Imaging Model with Near-field Light Sources (NIM-NLS) is specifically derived to design a scalable Light-aware Blind Deconvolution Network (LBDN). The glow-suppressed result is then brightened via a Retinex-based Enhancement Module (REM). Remarkably, the proposed glow suppression method is based on zero-shot learning and does not rely on any paired or unpaired training data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both glow suppression and low-light enhancement tasks",

    "title": "Hierarchical Semantic Contrast for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level annotations has achieved great processes through class activation map (CAM). Since vanilla CAMs are hardly served as guidance to bridge the gap between full and weak supervision, recent studies explore semantic representations to make CAM fit for WSSS and demonstrate encouraging results. However, they generally exploit single-level semantics, which may hamper the model to learn a comprehensive semantic structure. Motivated by the prior that each image has multiple levels of semantics, we propose hierarchical semantic contrast (HSC) to ameliorate the above problem. It conducts semantic contrast from coarse-grained to fine-grained perspective, including ROI level, class level, and pixel level, making the model learn a better object pattern understanding. To further improve CAM quality, building upon HSC, we explore consistency regularization of cross supervision and develop momentum prototype learning to utilize abundant semantics across different images. Extensive studies manifest that our plug-and-play learning paradigm, HSC, can significantly boost CAM quality on both non-saliency-guided and saliency-guided baselines, and establish new state-of-the-art WSSS performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.

    "title": "Learning Monocular Depth in Dynamic Environment via Context-aware Temporal Attention",
    "abstract": "The monocular depth estimation task has recently revealed encouraging prospects, especially for the autonomous driving task. To tackle the ill-posed problem of 3D geometric reasoning from 2D monocular images, multi-frame monocular methods are developed to leverage the perspective correlation information from sequential temporal frames. However, moving objects such as cars and trains usually violate the static scene assumption, leading to feature inconsistency deviation and misaligned cost values, which would mislead the optimization algorithm. In this work, we present CTA-Depth, a Context-aware Temporal Attention guided network for multi-frame monocular Depth estimation. Specifically, we first apply a multi-level attention enhancement module to integrate multi-level image features to obtain an initial depth and pose estimation. Then the proposed CTA-Refiner is adopted to alternatively optimize the depth and pose. During the CTA-Refiner process, context-aware temporal attention (CTA) is developed to capture the global temporal-context correlations to maintain the feature consistency and estimation integrity of moving objects. In particular, we propose a long-range geometry embedding (LGE) module to produce a long-range temporal geometry prior. Our approach achieves significant improvements (e.g., 13.5% for the Abs Rel metric on the KITTI dataset) over state-of-the-art approaches on three benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising has achieved promising results with the development of deep learning. A mainstream class of methods exploits the spatial-spectral correlations and recovers each band with the aids of neighboring bands, collectively referred to as spectral auxiliary networks. However, these methods treat entire adjacent spectral bands equally. In theory, clearer and nearer bands  tend to contain more reliable spectral information than noisier and farther ones with higher uncertainties. How to achieve spectral enhancement and adaptation of each adjacent band has become an urgent problem in HSI denoising. This work presents the UA-Adjustor, a comprehensive adjustor that enhances denoising performance by considering both the band-to-pixel and enhancement-to-adjustment aspects. Specifically, UA-Adjustor consists of three stages that evaluate the importance of neighboring bands, enhance neighboring bands based on uncertainty perception, and adjust the weight of spatial pixels in adjacent bands through estimated uncertainty. For its simplicity, UA-Adjustor can be flexibly plugged into existing spectral auxiliary networks to improve denoising behavior at low cost. Extensive experimental results validate that the proposed solution can improve over recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both simulated and real-world benchmarks by a large margin",

It is based on patch embeddings, rather than attentions paid to them, and their causal impacts on the model output. Other characteristics of ViTs such as causal overdetermination are considered in the design of ViT-CX. The empirical results show that ViT-CX produces more meaningful saliency maps and does a better job revealing all important evidence for the predictions than previous methods.

In this paper, we establish a multimodal-driven variational autoencoder (mmVAE) framework to perform 3D surface enhancement based on 2D normal images. To fully leverage the multimodal learning, we investigate a multimodal Gaussian mixture model (mmGMM) to align and fuse the latent feature representations from different modalities, and further propose a cross-scale encoder-decoder structure to reconstruct high-resolution normal images.

    "title": "Diagnose Like a Pathologist: Transformer-Enabled Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification",
    "abstract": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) and transformers are increasingly popular in histopathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. However, unlike human pathologists who selectively observe specific regions of histopathology tissues under different magnifications, most methods do not incorporate multiple resolutions of the WSIs, hierarchically and attentively, thereby leading to a loss of focus on the WSIs and information from other resolutions. To resolve this issue, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-Guided Multiple Instance Learning framework to fully exploit the WSIs. This framework can dynamically and attentively discover the discriminative regions across multiple resolutions of the WSIs. Within this framework, an Integrated Attention Transformer is proposed to further enhance the performance of the transformer and obtain a more holistic WSI (bag) representation. This transformer consists of multiple Integrated Attention Modules, which is the combination of a transformer layer and an aggregation module that produces a bag representation based on every instance representation in that bag.

In this work, we design a novel data augmentation strategy called ``Universal Adaptive Data Augmentation\" (UADA). Different from existing methods, UADA would adaptively update DA's parameters according to the target model's gradient information during training: given a pre-defined set of DA operations, we randomly decide types and magnitudes of DA operations for every data batch during training, and adaptively update DA's parameters along the gradient direction of the loss concerning DA's parameters. In this way, UADA can increase the training loss of the target networks, and the target networks would learn features from harder samples to improve the generalization. Moreover, UADA is very general and can be utilized in numerous tasks, e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection.

Our new benchmark (VIPOSeg) contains exhaustive object annotations and covers various real-world object categories which are carefully divided into subsets of thing/stuff and seen/unseen classes for comprehensive evaluation. Considering the challenges in panoptic VOS, we propose a strong baseline method named panoptic object association with transformers (PAOT), which associates multiple objects by panoptic identification in a pyramid architecture on multiple scales. Experimental results show that VIPOSeg can not only boost the performance of VOS models by panoptic training but also evaluate them comprehensively in panoptic scenes.

    "abstract": "Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), one of the standard intelligence tests in human psychology, has recently emerged as a powerful tool for studying abstract visual reasoning (AVR) abilities in machines. Although existing computational models for RPM problems achieve good performance, they require a large number of labeled training examples for supervised learning. In contrast, humans can efficiently solve unlabeled RPM problems after learning from only a few example questions. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method, called RuleMatch, to train deep models with a small number of labeled RPM questions along with other unlabeled questions. Moreover, instead of using pixel-level augmentation in object perception tasks, we exploit the nature of RPM problems and augment the data at the level of abstract rules. Specifically, we disrupt the possible rules contained among context images in an RPM question and force the two augmented variants of the same unlabeled sample to obey the same abstract rule and predict a common pseudo label for training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed RuleMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular RAVEN datasets.

Following this principle, a novel method named Ensemble Learning with Multi-Order Statistics (ELMOS) is proposed in this paper. In this method, after the backbone network, we use multiple branches to create the individual learners in the ensemble learning, with the goal to reduce the storage cost. We then introduce different order statistics pooling in each branch to increase the diversity of the individual learners.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm in video synthesis tasks including prediction, generation, and interpolation. Due to the limitation of the computational budget, existing methods usually implement conditional diffusion models with an autoregressive inference pipeline, in which the future fragment is predicted based on the distribution of adjacent past frames. However, only the conditions from a few previous frames can't capture the global temporal coherence, leading to inconsistent or even outrageous results in long-term video prediction. In this paper, we propose a Local-Global Context guided Video Diffusion model (LGC-VD) to capture multi-perception conditions for producing high-quality videos in both conditional/unconditional settings. In LGC-VD, the UNet is implemented with stacked residual blocks with self-attention units, avoiding the undesirable computational cost in 3D Conv. We construct a local-global context guidance strategy to capture the multi-perceptual embedding of the past fragment to boost the consistency of future prediction. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training strategy to alleviate the effect of noisy frames for more stable predictions.

Unfortunately, existing methods based on pseudo-label learning suffer from the changing target domain environment, and the quality of generated pseudo-labels is attenuated due to the domain shift, leading to instantaneous negative learning and long-term knowledge forgetting. To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework for exploring safety supervision with three elaborate strategies: Label Safety, Sample Safety, and Parameter Safety. Firstly, to select reliable pseudo-labels, we define and adjust the confidence threshold in a self-adaptive manner according to the test-time learning status. Secondly, a soft-weighted contrastive learning module is presented to explore the highly-correlated samples and discriminate uncorrelated ones, improving the instantaneous efficiency of the model. Finally, we frame a Soft Weight Alignment strategy to normalize the distance between the parameters of the adapted model and the source pre-trained model, which alleviates the long-term problem of knowledge forgetting and significantly improves the accuracy of the adapted model in the late adaptation stage.

The task is challenging due to the high dimensionality nature of an action, as well as the subtle motion details to be considered. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically learn from articulated motion sequences in the straightforward 3D Euclidean space. However, the vanilla Euclidean space is not efficient for modeling important motion characteristics such as the joint-wise angular acceleration, which reveals the driving force behind the motion. Moreover, current methods typically attend to each channel equally and lack theoretical constrains on extracting task-relevant features from the input. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we seek to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) We propose to incorporate an acceleration representation, explicitly modeling the higher-order variations in motion. (2) We introduce a novel Stream-GCN network equipped with multi-stream components and channel attention, where different representations (i.e., streams) supplement each other towards a more precise action recognition while attention capitalizes on those important channels. (3) We explore feature-level supervision for maximizing the extraction of task-relevant information and formulate this into a mutual information loss. Empirically, our approach sets the new state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA",

    "title": "Orientation-Independent Chinese Text Recognition in Scene Images",
    "abstract": "Scene text recognition (STR) has attracted much attention due to its broad applications. The previous works pay more attention to dealing with the recognition of Latin text images with complex backgrounds by introducing language models or other auxiliary networks. Different from Latin texts, many vertical Chinese texts exist in natural scenes, which brings difficulties to current state-of-the-art STR methods. In this paper, we take the first attempt to extract orientation-independent visual features by disentangling content and orientation information of text images, thus recognizing both horizontal and vertical texts robustly in natural scenes. Specifically, we introduce a Character Image Reconstruction Network (CIRN) to recover corresponding printed character images with disentangled content and orientation information. We conduct experiments on a scene dataset for benchmarking Chinese text recognition, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can indeed improve performance through disentangling content and orientation information. To further validate the effectiveness of our method, we additionally collect a Vertical Chinese Text Recognition (VCTR) dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 45.63\\% improvement on VCTR when introducing CIRN to the baseline model",

    "title": "Actor-Multi-Scale Context Bidirectional Higher Order Interactive Relation Network for Spatial-Temporal Action Localization",
    "abstract": "The key to video action detection lies in the understanding of interaction between persons and background objects in a video. Current methods usually employ object detectors to extract objects directly or use grid features to represent objects in the environment, which underestimate the great potential of multi-scale context information (e.g., objects and scenes of different sizes). How to exactly represent the multi-scale context and make full utilization of it still remains an unresolved challenge for spatial-temporal action localization. In this paper, we propose a novel Actor-Multi-Scale Context Bidirectional Higher Order Interactive Relation Network (AMCRNet) that extracts multi-scale context through multiple pooling layers with different sizes. Specifically, we develop an Interactive Relation Extraction module to model the higher-order relation between the target person and the context (e.g., other persons and objects). Along this line, we further propose a History Feature Bank and Interaction method to achieve better performance by modeling such relation across continuing video clips. Extensive experimental results on AVA2.2 and UCF101-24 demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our proposed AMCRNet",

In this paper, we propose a black-box prompt tuning framework for VLMs to learn task-relevant prompts without back-propagation. In particular, the vision and language prompts are jointly optimized in the intrinsic parameter subspace with various evolution strategies. Different prompt variants are also explored to enhance the cross-model interaction. Experimental results show that our proposed black-box prompt tuning framework outperforms both hand-crafted prompt engineering and gradient-based prompt learning methods, which serves as evidence of its capability to train task-relevant prompts in a derivative-free manner",

    "abstract": "Vision model have gained increasing attention due to their simplicity and efficiency in Scene Text Recognition (STR) task. However, due to lacking the perception of linguistic knowledge and information, recent vision models suffer from two problems: (1) the pure vision-based query results in attention drift, which usually causes poor recognition and is summarized as linguistic insensitive drift (LID) problem in this paper. (2) the visual feature is suboptimal for the recognition in some vision-missing cases (e.g. occlusion, etc.). To address these issues, we propose a Linguistic Perception Vision model (LPV), which explores the linguistic capability of vision model for accurate text recognition. To alleviate the LID problem, we introduce a Cascade Position Attention (CPA) mechanism that obtains high-quality and accurate attention maps through step-wise optimization and linguistic information mining. Furthermore, a Global Linguistic Reconstruction Module (GLRM) is proposed to improve the representation of visual features by perceiving the linguistic information in the visual space, which gradually converts visual features into semantically rich ones during the cascade process. Different from previous methods, our method obtains SOTA results while keeping low complexity (92.4% accuracy with only 8.11M parameters). Code is available at https://github.com/CyrilSterling/LPV",

Most existing methods learn a fixed network to predict the action of each frame with the neighboring frames. However, this would result in ambiguity when estimating similar actions, such as pouring juice and pouring coffee. To address this, we aim to exploit temporally global but spatially local human-object interactions (HOI) as video-level prior knowledge for action segmentation. The long-term HOI sequence provides crucial contextual information to distinguish ambiguous actions, where our network dynamically adapts to the given HOI sequence at test time. More specifically, we first design a video HOI encoder that extracts, selects, and integrates the most representative HOI throughout the video. Then, we propose a two-branch HyperNetwork to learn an adaptive temporal encoder, which automatically adjusts the parameters based on the HOI information of various videos on the fly.

On the other hand, in empirical study, the code-oriented methods lose object consistency as their generated images miss certain objects in the input scene graph. To alleviate these two issues, we propose Learning Object Consistency and Interaction (LOCI). To preserve object consistency, we design a consistency module with a weighted augmentation strategy for objects easy to be ignored and a matching loss between scene graphs and image codes. To learn object interaction, we design an interaction module consisting of three kinds of message propagation between the input scene graph and the learned image code.

Specifically, our method incorporates an explicit self-supervised manifold regularization, revealing consistent cumulative target dependency across domains, to a self-training scheme (e.g., the popular Self-Paced Self-Training) to encourage more discriminative transferable representations of regression tasks. Moreover, learning unified implicit neural functions to estimate relative direction and distance of targets to their nearest class bins aims to refine target classification predictions, which can gain robust performance against inconsistent feature scaling sensitive to UDA regressors.

However, due to the scarcity of the support data provided, FSS methods still suffer from the intra-class and inter-class gaps. In this paper, we propose a uniform network to fill both the gaps, termed FGNet. It consists of the novel design of a Self-Adaptive Module (SAM) to emphasize the query feature to generate an enhanced prototype for self-alignment. Such a prototype caters to each query sample itself since it contains the underlying intra-instance information, which gets around the intra-class appearance gap. Moreover, we design an Inter-class Feature Separation Module (IFSM) to separate the feature space of the target class from other classes, which contributes to bridging the inter-class gap. In addition, we present several new losses and a method termed B-SLIC, which help to further enhance the separation performance of FGNet. Experimental results show that FGNet reduces both the gaps for FSS by SAM and IFSM respectively, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets compared with previous top-performing approaches",

    "abstract": "The visual quality of point clouds has been greatly emphasized since the ever-increasing 3D vision applications are expected to provide cost-effective and high-quality experiences for users.  Looking back on the development of point cloud quality assessment (PCQA), the visual quality is usually evaluated by utilizing single-modal information, i.e., either extracted from the 2D projections or 3D point cloud. The 2D projections contain rich texture and semantic information but are highly dependent on viewpoints, while the 3D point clouds are more sensitive to geometry distortions and invariant to viewpoints. Therefore, to leverage the advantages of both point cloud and projected image modalities, we propose a novel no-reference Multi-Modal Point Cloud Quality Assessment (MM-PCQA) metric. In specific, we split the point clouds into sub-models to represent local geometry distortions such as point shift and down-sampling. Then we render the point clouds into 2D image projections for texture feature extraction. To achieve the goals, the sub-models and projected images are encoded with point-based and image-based neural networks. Finally, symmetric cross-modal attention is employed to fuse multi-modal quality-aware information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms all compared state-of-the-art methods and is far ahead of previous no-reference PCQA methods, which highlights the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Text irregularities pose significant challenges to scene text recognizers. Thin-Plate Spline (TPS)-based rectification is widely regarded as an effective means to deal with them. Currently, the calculation of TPS transformation parameters purely depends on the quality of regressed text borders. It ignores the text content and often leads to unsatisfactory rectified results for severely distorted text. In this work, we introduce TPS++, an attention-enhanced TPS transformation that incorporates the attention mechanism to text rectification for the first time. TPS++ formulates the parameter calculation as a joint process of foreground control point regression and content-based attention score estimation, which is computed by a dedicated designed gated-attention block. TPS++ builds a more flexible content-aware rectifier, generating a natural text correction that is easier to read by the subsequent recognizer. Moreover, TPS++ shares the feature backbone with the recognizer in part and implements the rectification at feature-level rather than image-level, incurring only a small overhead in terms of parameters and inference time. Experiments on public benchmarks show that TPS++ consistently improves the recognition and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Meanwhile, it generalizes well on different backbones and recognizers.

    "title": "Video Frame Interpolation with Densely Queried Bilateral Correlation",
    "abstract": "Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to synthesize non-existent intermediate frames between existent frames. Flow-based VFI algorithms estimate intermediate motion fields to warp the existent frames. Real-world motions' complexity and the reference frame's absence make motion estimation challenging. Many state-of-the-art approaches explicitly model the correlations between two neighboring frames for more accurate motion estimation. In common approaches, the receptive field of correlation modeling at higher resolution depends on the motion fields estimated beforehand. Such receptive field dependency makes common motion estimation approaches poor at coping with small and fast-moving objects. To better model correlations and to produce more accurate motion fields, we propose the Densely Queried Bilateral Correlation (DQBC) that gets rid of the receptive field dependency problem and thus is more friendly to small and fast-moving objects. The motion fields generated with the help of DQBC are further refined and up-sampled with context features. After the motion fields are fixed, a CNN-based SynthNet synthesizes the final interpolated frame. Experiments show that our approach enjoys higher accuracy and less inference time than the state-of-the-art. Source code is available at https://github.com/kinoud/DQBC",

    "title": "Pyramid Diffusion Models for Low-light Image Enhancement",
    "abstract": "Recovering noise-covered details from low-light images is challenging, and the results given by previous methods leave room for improvement. Recent diffusion models show realistic and detailed image generation through a sequence of denoising refinements and motivate us to introduce them to low-light image enhancement for recovering realistic details. However, we found two problems when doing this, i.e., 1) diffusion models keep constant resolution in one reverse process, which limits the speed; 2) diffusion models sometimes result in global degradation (e.g., RGB shift). To address the above problems, this paper proposes a Pyramid Diffusion model (PyDiff) for low-light image enhancement. PyDiff uses a novel pyramid diffusion method to perform sampling in a pyramid resolution style (i.e., progressively increasing resolution in one reverse process). Pyramid diffusion makes PyDiff much faster than vanilla diffusion models and introduces no performance degradation. Furthermore, PyDiff uses a global corrector to alleviate the global degradation that may occur in the reverse process, significantly improving the performance and making the training of diffusion models easier with little additional computational consumption. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that PyDiff achieves superior performance and efficiency. Moreover, PyDiff can generalize well to unseen noise and illumination distributions.

    "abstract": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a crucial role in industrial manufacturing by providing geometry information and the construction workflow for manufactured objects. The construction information enables effective re-editing of parametric CAD models. While boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard format for representing geometry structures, JSON format is an alternative due to the lack of uniform criteria for storing the construction workflow. Regrettably, most CAD models available on the Internet only offer geometry information, omitting the construction procedure and hampering creation efficiency. This paper proposes a learning approach CADParser to infer the underlying modeling sequences given a B-Rep CAD model. It achieves this by treating the CAD geometry structure as a graph and the construction workflow as a sequence. Since the existing CAD dataset only contains two operations (i.e., Sketch and Extrusion), limiting the diversity of the CAD model creation, we also introduce a large-scale dataset incorporating a more comprehensive range of operations such as Revolution, Fillet, and Chamfer. Each model includes both the geometry structure and the construction sequences.

Before embedding the frequency priors into the network, we first harmonize the multi-scale side-out features to reduce their heterogeneity. This is achieved by our feature harmonization module, which is based on a gating mechanism to harmonize the grouped features. Finally, we propose a frequency prior embedding module to embed the frequency priors into multi-scale features through an adaptive modulation strategy.

Due to the high cost of data annotation and data collection, current VLN datasets provide limited instruction-trajectory data samples. Learning vision-language alignment for VLN from limited data is challenging since visual observation and language instruction are both complex and diverse. Previous works only generate augmented data based on original scenes while failing to generate data samples from unseen scenes, which limits the generalization ability of the navigation agent. In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge-driven Environmental Dreamer (KED), a method that leverages the knowledge of the embodied environment and generates unseen scenes for a navigation agent to learn. Generating an unseen environment with texture consistency and structure consistency is challenging. To address this problem, we incorporate three knowledge-driven regularization objectives into the KED and adopt a reweighting mechanism for self-adaptive optimization. Our KED method is able to generate unseen embodied environments without extra annotations. We use KED to successfully generate 270 houses and 500K instruction-trajectory pairs. The navigation agent with the KED method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various VLN benchmarks, such as R2R, R4R, and RxR.

    "title": "Towards Accurate Video Text Spotting with Text-wise Semantic Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Video text spotting (VTS) aims at extracting texts from videos, where text detection, tracking and recognition are conducted simultaneously. There have been some works that can tackle VTS; however, they may ignore the underlying semantic relationships among texts within a frame. We observe that the texts within a frame usually share similar semantics, which suggests that, if one text is predicted incorrectly by a text recognizer, it still has a chance to be corrected via semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose an accurate video text spotter, VLSpotter, that reads texts visually, linguistically, and semantically. For ‘visually’, we propose a plug-and-play text-focused super-resolution module to alleviate motion blur and enhance video quality. For ‘linguistically’, a language model is employed to capture intra-text context to mitigate wrongly spelled text predictions. For ‘semantically’, we propose a text-wise semantic reasoning module to model inter-text semantic relationships and reason for better results. The experimental results on multiple VTS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed VLSpotter outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in end-to-end video text spotting",

    "abstract": "Using a regular language as a pattern for string matching is nowadays a common -and sometimes unsafe- operation, provided as a built-in feature by most programming languages. A proper constraint solver over string variables should support most of the operations over regular expressions and related constructs. However, state-of-the-art string solvers natively support only the membership relation of a string variable to a regular language. Here we take a step forward by defining a specialised propagator for the match operation, returning the leftmost position where a pattern can match a given string. Empirical evidences show the effectiveness of our approach, implemented within the constraint programming framework, and tested against state-of-the-art string solvers",

    "title": "Constraints First: A New MDD-based Model to Generate Sentences Under Constraints",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new approach to generating strongly constrained texts. We consider standardized sentence generation for the typical application of vision screening. To solve this problem, we formalize it as a discrete combinatorial optimization problem and utilize multivalued decision diagrams (MDD), a well-known data structure to deal with constraints. In our context, one key strength of MDD is to compute an exhaustive set of solutions without performing any search. Once the sentences are obtained, we apply a language model (GPT-2) to keep the best ones. We detail this for English and also for French where the agreement and conjugation rules are known to be more complex. Finally, with the help of GPT-2, we get hundreds of bona-fide candidate sentences. When compared with the few dozen sentences usually available in the well-known vision screening test (MNREAD), this brings a major breakthrough in the field of standardized sentence generation. Also, as it can be easily adapted for other languages, it has the potential to make the MNREAD test even more valuable and usable. More generally, this paper highlights MDD as a convincing alternative for constrained text generation, especially when the constraints are hard to satisfy, but also for many other prospects",

    "title": "Learning When to Use Automatic Tabulation in Constraint Model Reformulation",
    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimisation has numerous practical applications, such as planning, logistics, or circuit design. Problems such as these can be solved by approaches such as Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) or Constraint Programming (CP). Solver performance is affected significantly by the model chosen to represent a given problem, which has led to the study of model reformulation. One such method is tabulation: rewriting the expression of some of the model constraints in terms of a single “table” constraint. Successfully applying this process means identifying expressions amenable to trans- formation, which has typically been done manually. Recent work introduced an automatic tabulation using a set of hand-designed heuristics to identify constraints to tabulate. However, the performance of these heuristics varies across problem classes and solvers. Recent work has shown learning techniques to be increasingly useful in the context of automatic model reformulation. The goal of this study is to understand whether it is possible to improve the performance of such heuristics, by learning a model to predict whether or not to activate them for a given instance. Experimental results suggest that a random forest classifier is the most robust choice, improving the performance of four different SAT and CP solvers",

In this paper we consider the problem of deciding if a (likely incomplete) description of a system of events is consistent, the network consistency problem for the point algebra of partially ordered time (POT). While the classical complexity of this problem has been fully settled, comparably little is known of the fine-grained complexity of POT except that it can\r\nbe solved in O*((0.368n)^n) time by enumerating ordered partitions. We construct a much faster algorithm with a run-time bounded by O*((0.26n)^n), which, e.g., is roughly 1000 times faster than the naive enumeration algorithm in a problem with 20 events. This is achieved by a sophisticated enumeration of structures similar to total orders, which are then greedily expanded toward a solution. While similar ideas have been explored earlier for related problems it turns out that the analysis for POT is non-trivial and requires significant new ideas",

    "abstract": "Allen's interval algebra is one of the most well-known calculi in qualitative temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence. Very recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity of NP-hard reasoning tasks in this algebra, which has improved the running time from the naive 2^O(n^2) to O*((1.0615n)^n), and even faster algorithms are known for unit intervals and the case when we a bounded number of overlapping intervals. \r\nDespite these improvements the best known lower bound is still only 2^o(n) under the exponential-time hypothesis and major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances in computational complexity. \r\nIn this paper we propose a novel framework for solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic programming with sublinear partitioning. \r\n Using this technique we obtain a major improvement of O*((cn/log(n))^n) for Allen's interval algebra. To demonstrate that the technique is applicable to further problem domains we apply it to a problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction calculus, and solve it in O*((cn/log(n))^(2n/3)) time. Hence, not only do we significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems, but obtain a novel algorithmic technique that is likely applicable to many problems where 2^O(n) time algorithms are unlikely",

One typical strategy is algorithm unrolling, which relies on automatic differentiation through the operations of an iterative solver. While flexible and general, unrolling can encounter accuracy and efficiency issues in practice. These issues can be avoided by analytical differentiation of the optimization, but current frameworks impose rigid requirements on the optimization problem's form. This paper provides theoretical insights into the backward pass of unrolled optimization, leading to a system for generating  efficiently solvable analytical models of backpropagation. Additionally, it proposes a unifying view of unrolling and analytical differentiation through optimization mappings.

    "title": "Solving the Identifying Code Set Problem with Grouped Independent Support",
    "abstract": "An important problem in network science is finding an optimal placement of sensors in nodes in order to uniquely detect failures in the network. This problem can be modelled as an identifying code set (ICS) problem, introduced by Karpovsky et al. in 1998. The ICS problem aims to find a cover of a set S, such that the elements in the cover define a unique signature for each of the elements of S, and to minimise the cover’s cardinality. In this work, we study a generalised identifying code set (GICS) problem, where a unique signature must be found for each subset of S that has a cardinality of at most k (instead of just each element of S). The concept of an independent support of a Boolean formula was introduced by Chakraborty et al. in 2014 to speed up propositional model counting, by identifying a subset of variables whose truth assignments uniquely define those of the other variables.\r\n\r\nIn this work, we introduce an extended version of independent support, grouped independent support (GIS), and show how to reduce the GICS problem to the GIS problem. We then propose a new solving method for finding a GICS, based on finding a GIS. We show that the prior state-of-the-art approaches yield integer-linear programming (ILP) models whose sizes grow exponentially with the problem size and k, while our GIS encoding only grows polynomially with the problem size and k. While the ILP approach can solve the GICS problem on networks of at most 494 nodes, the GIS-based method can handle networks of up to 21 363 nodes; a ∼40× improvement. The GIS-based method shows up to a 520× improvement on the ILP-based method in terms of median solving time. For the majority of the instances that can be encoded and solved by both methods, the cardinality of the solution returned by the GIS-based method is less than 10% larger than the cardinality of the solution found by the ILP method",

The core part of GAC for alldifferent constraints is excavating and enumerating all the strongly connected components (SCCs) of the graph model. This causes a large amount of complex data structures to maintain the node information, leading to a large overhead both in time and memory space. More critically, the complexity of the data structures further precludes the coordination of different optimization schemes for GAC. To solve this problem, the key observation of this paper is that the GAC algorithm only cares whether a node of the graph model is in an SCC or not, rather than which SCCs it belongs to. Based on this observation, we propose AllDiffbit, which employs bitwise data structures and operations to efficiently determine if a node is in an SCC. This greatly reduces the corresponding overhead, and enhances the ability to incorporate existing optimizations to work in a synergistic way. Our experiments show that AllDiffbit outperforms the state-of-the-art GAC algorithms over 60%",

    "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is an effective way to learn generalized graph representations in a self-supervised manner, and has grown rapidly in recent years. However, the underlying community semantics has not been well explored by most previous GCL methods. Research that attempts to leverage communities in GCL regards them as having the same influence on the graph, leading to extra representation errors. To tackle this issue, we define ''community strength'' to measure the difference of influence among communities. Under this premise, we propose a Community-Strength-enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning (CSGCL) framework to preserve community strength throughout the learning process. Firstly, we present two novel graph augmentation methods, Communal Attribute Voting (CAV) and Communal Edge Dropping (CED), where the perturbations of node attributes and edges are guided by community strength. Secondly, we propose a dynamic ''Team-up'' contrastive learning scheme, where community strength is used to progressively fine-tune the contrastive objective. We report extensive experiment results on three downstream tasks: node classification, node clustering, and link prediction. CSGCL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other GCL methods, validating that community strength brings effectiveness and generality to graph representations.

    "title": "Probabilistic Masked Attention Networks for Explainable Sequential Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Transformer-based models are powerful for modeling temporal dynamics of user preference in sequential recommendation. Most of the variants adopt the Softmax transformation in the self-attention layers to generate dense attention probabilities. However, real-world item sequences are often noisy, containing a mixture of true-positive and false-positive interactions. Such dense attentions inevitably assign probability mass to noisy or irrelevant items, leading to sub-optimal performance and poor explainability. Here we propose a Probabilistic Masked Attention Network (PMAN) to identify the sparse pattern of attentions, which is more desirable for pruning noisy items in sequential recommendation. Specifically, we employ a probabilistic mask to achieve sparse attentions under a constrained optimization framework. As such, PMAN allows to select which information is critical to be retained or dropped in a data-driven fashion. Experimental studies on real-world benchmark datasets show that PMAN is able to improve the performance of Transformers significantly",

    "title": "Learning Gaussian Mixture Representations for Tensor Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Tensor time series (TTS) data, a generalization of one-dimensional time series on a high-dimensional space, is ubiquitous in real-world scenarios, especially in monitoring systems involving multi-source spatio-temporal data (e.g., transportation demands and air pollutants). Compared to modeling time series or multivariate time series, which has received much attention and achieved tremendous progress in recent years, tensor time series has been paid less effort. Properly coping with the tensor time series is a much more challenging task, due to its high-dimensional and complex inner structure. In this paper, we develop a novel TTS forecasting framework, which seeks to individually model each heterogeneity component implied in the time, the location, and the source variables. We name this framework as GMRL, short for Gaussian Mixture Representation Learning. Experiment results on two real-world TTS datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

    "title": "Adaptive Path-Memory Network for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning aims to predict the future missing facts based on historical information and has gained increasing research interest recently. Lots of works have been made to model the historical structural and temporal characteristics for the reasoning task. Most existing works model the graph structure mainly depending on entity representation. However, the magnitude of TKG entities in real-world scenarios is considerable, and an increasing number of new entities will arise as time goes on. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture modeling with relation feature of TKG, namely aDAptivE path-MemOry Network (DaeMon), which adaptively models the temporal path information between query subject and each object candidate across history time. It models the historical information without depending on entity representation. Specifically, DaeMon uses path memory to record the temporal path information derived from path aggregation unit across timeline considering the memory passing strategy between adjacent timestamps. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets demonstrate that our proposed model obtains substantial performance improvement and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 4.8% absolute in MRR",

    "abstract": "Typically, trajectories considered anomalous are the ones deviating from usual (e.g., traffic-dictated) driving patterns. However, this closed-set context fails to recognize the unknown anomalous trajectories, resulting in an insufficient self-motivated learning paradigm. In this study, we investigate the novel Anomalous Trajectory Recognition problem in an Open-world scenario (ATRO) and introduce a novel probabilistic Metric learning model, namely ATROM, to address it. Specifically, ATROM can detect the presence of unknown anomalous behavior in addition to identifying known behavior. It has a Mutual Interaction Distillation that uses contrastive metric learning to explore the interactive semantics regarding the diverse behavioral intents and a Probabilistic Trajectory Embedding that forces the trajectories with distinct behaviors to follow different Gaussian priors. More importantly, ATROM offers a probabilistic metric rule to discriminate between known and unknown behavioral patterns by taking advantage of the approximation of multiple priors. Experimental results on two large-scale trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of ATROM in addressing both known and unknown anomalous patterns",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph-based anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted rising attention due to its effectiveness in identifying anomalies in relational and structured data. Unfortunately, the performance of most existing GAD methods suffers from the inherent structural noises of graphs induced by hidden anomalies connected with considerable benign nodes. In this work, we propose SparseGAD, a novel GAD framework that sparsifies the structures of target graphs to effectively reduce noises and collaboratively learns node representations. It then robustly detects anomalies by uncovering the underlying dependency among node pairs in terms of homophily and heterophily, two essential connection properties of GAD. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets of GAD demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better detection quality compared with the state-of-the-art methods, even when the graph is heavily attacked.

    "title": "Targeting Minimal Rare Itemsets from Transaction Databases",
    "abstract": "The computation of minimal rare itemsets is a well known task in data mining, with numerous applications, e.g., drugs effects analysis and network security, among others. This paper presents a novel approach to the computation of minimal rare itemsets. First, we introduce a generalization of the traditional minimal rare itemset model called k-minimal rare itemset. A k-minimal rare itemset is defined as an itemset that becomes frequent or rare based on the removal of at least k or at most (k − 1) items from it. We claim that our work is the first to propose this generalization in the field of data mining. We then present a SAT-based framework for efficiently discovering k-minimal rare itemsets from large transaction databases. Afterwards, by partitioning the k-minimal rare itemset mining problem into smaller sub-problems, we aim to make it more manageable and easier to solve. Finally, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, we conduct extensive experimental analysis using various popular datasets. We compare our method with existing specialized algorithms and CP-based algorithms commonly used for this task",

    "title": "Enhancing Network by Reinforcement Learning and Neural Confined Local Search",
    "abstract": "It has been found that many real networks, such as power grids and the Internet, are non-robust, i.e., attacking a small set of nodes would cause the paralysis of the entire network. Thus, the Network Enhancement Problem~(NEP), i.e., improving the robustness of a given network by modifying its structure, has attracted increasing attention. Heuristics have been proposed to address NEP. However, a hand-engineered heuristic often has significant performance limitations. A recently proposed model solving NEP by reinforcement learning has shown superior performance than heuristics on in-distribution datasets. However, their model shows considerably inferior out-of-distribution generalization ability when enhancing networks against the degree-based targeted attack. In this paper, we propose a more effective model with stronger generalization ability by incorporating domain knowledge including measurements of local network structures and decision criteria of heuristics. We further design a hierarchical attention model to utilize the network structure directly, where the query range changes from local to global. Finally, we propose neural confined local search~(NCLS) to realize the effective search of a large neighborhood, which exploits a learned model to confine the neighborhood to avoid exhaustive enumeration. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real networks to verify the ability of our models",

    "title": "OSDP: Optimal Sharded Data Parallel for Distributed Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models contribute to significant performance improvements on varieties of downstream tasks. Current data and model parallelism approaches utilize model replication and partition techniques to support the distributed training of ultra-large models. However, directly deploying these systems often leads to sub-optimal training efficiency due to the complex model architectures and the strict device memory constraints. In this paper, we propose Optimal Sharded Data Parallel (OSDP), an automated parallel training system that combines the advantages from both data and model parallelism. Given the model description and the device information, OSDP makes trade-offs between the memory consumption and the hardware utilization, thus automatically generates the distributed computation graph and maximizes the overall system throughput. In addition, OSDP introduces operator splitting to further alleviate peak memory footprints during training with negligible overheads, which enables the trainability of larger models as well as the higher throughput. Extensive experimental results of OSDP on multiple different kinds of large-scale models demonstrate that the proposed strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art in multiple regards",

    "title": "Hawkes Process Based on Controlled Differential Equations",
    "abstract": "Hawkes processes are a popular framework to model the occurrence of sequential events, i.e., occurrence dynamics, in several fields such as social diffusion. In real-world scenarios, the inter-arrival time among events is irregular. However, existing neural network-based Hawkes process models not only i) fail to capture such complicated irregular dynamics, but also ii) resort to heuristics to calculate the log-likelihood of events since they are mostly based on neural networks designed for regular discrete inputs. To this end, we present the concept of Hawkes process based on controlled differential equations (HP-CDE), by adopting the neural controlled differential equation (neural CDE) technology which is an analogue to continuous RNNs. Since HP-CDE continuously reads data, i) irregular time-series datasets can be properly treated preserving their uneven temporal spaces, and ii) the log-likelihood can be exactly computed. Moreover, as both Hawkes processes and neural CDEs are first developed to model complicated human behavioral dynamics, neural CDE-based Hawkes processes are successful in modeling such occurrence dynamics. In our experiments with 4 real-world datasets, our method outperforms existing methods by non-trivial margins",

This improves upon the previous work on sublinear approximate degeneracy, which implies a (4 + epsilon)-approximate ~O(n) solution. Our algorithm can be extended to an approximate O(n log n) time solution to the k-core decomposition problem. We also explore the use of our approximate algorithm as a technique for speeding up exact degeneracy computation. We prove theoretical guarantees of our algorithm and provide optimizations, which improve the running time of our algorithm in practice.

    "title": "SMARTformer: Semi-Autoregressive Transformer with Efficient Integrated Window Attention for Long Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "The success of Transformers in long time series forecasting (LTSF) can be attributed to their attention mechanisms and non-autoregressive (NAR) decoder structures, which capture long-range de- pendencies. However, time series data also contain abundant local temporal dependencies, which are often overlooked in the literature and significantly hinder forecasting performance. To address this issue, we introduce SMARTformer, which stands for SeMi-AutoRegressive Transformer. SMARTformer utilizes the Integrated Window Attention (IWA) and Semi-AutoRegressive (SAR) Decoder to capture global and local dependencies from both encoder and decoder perspectives. IWA conducts local self-attention in multi-scale windows and global attention across windows with linear com- plexity to achieve complementary clues in local and enlarged receptive fields. SAR generates subsequences iteratively, similar to autoregressive (AR) decoding, but refines the entire sequence in a NAR manner. This way, SAR benefits from both the global horizon of NAR and the local detail capturing of AR. We also introduce the Time-Independent Embedding (TIE), which better captures local dependencies by avoiding entanglements of various periods that can occur when directly adding po- sitional embedding to value embedding. Our ex- tensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SMARTformer against state-of-the-art models, achieving an improvement of 10.2% and 18.4% in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting, respectively",

    "abstract": "As deep learning gains popularity in modelling dynamical systems, we expose an underappreciated misunderstanding relevant to modelling dynamics on networks. Strongly influenced by graph neural networks, latent vertex embeddings are naturally adopted in many neural dynamical network models. However, we show that embeddings tend to induce a model that fits observations well but simultaneously has incorrect dynamical behaviours. Recognising that previous studies narrowly focus on short-term predictions during the transient phase of a flow, we propose three tests for correct long-term behaviour, and illustrate how an embedding-based dynamical model fails these tests, and analyse the causes, particularly through the lens of topological conjugacy. In doing so, we show that the difficulties can be avoided by not using embedding. We propose a simple embedding-free alternative based on parametrising two additive vector-field components. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the proposed model can reliably recover a broad class of dynamics on different network topologies from time series data",

    "abstract": "While massive valuable deep models trained on large-scale data have been released to facilitate the artificial intelligence community, they may encounter attacks in deployment which leads to privacy leakage of training data. In this work, we propose a learning approach termed differentially private data-free distillation (DPDFD) for model conversion that can convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via an intermediate generator without access to training data. The learning collaborates three parties in a unified way. First, massive synthetic data are generated with the generator. Then, they are fed into the teacher and student to compute differentially private gradients by normalizing the gradients and adding noise before performing descent. Finally, the student is updated with these differentially private gradients and the generator is updated by taking the student as a fixed discriminator in an alternate manner. In addition to a privacy-preserving student, the generator can generate synthetic data in a differentially private way for other down-stream tasks. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and well convergence. Extensive experiments that significantly outperform other differentially private generative approaches demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach",

However, existing GTs still perform unsatisfactorily on the node classification task due to 1) the overwhelming unrelated information obtained from a vast number of irrelevant distant nodes and 2) the quadratic complexity regarding the number of nodes via the fully connected attention mechanism. In this paper, we present Gapformer, a method for node classification that deeply incorporates Graph Transformer with Graph Pooling. More specifically, Gapformer coarsens the large-scale nodes of a graph into a smaller number of pooling nodes via local or global graph pooling methods, and then computes the attention solely with the pooling nodes rather than all other nodes. In such a manner, the negative influence of the overwhelming unrelated nodes is mitigated while maintaining the long-range information, and the quadratic complexity is reduced to linear complexity with respect to the fixed number of pooling nodes. Extensive experiments on 13 node classification datasets, including homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets, demonstrate the competitive performance of Gapformer over existing Graph Neural Networks and GTs",

    "abstract": "With the development of modern internet techniques, Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) systems have been widely exploited for tackling the data-sparsity problem. Meanwhile most current CDR models assume that user-item interactions are accessible across different domains. However, such knowledge sharing process will break the privacy protection policy. In this paper, we focus on the  Privacy-Preserving Multi-Domain Recommendation problem (PPMDR). The problem is challenging since different domains are sparse and heterogeneous with the privacy protection. To tackle the above issues, we propose Federated Probabilistic Preference Distribution Modelling (FPPDM). FPPDM includes two main components, i.e., local domain modelling component and global server aggregation component with federated learning strategy. The local domain modelling component aims to exploit user/item preference distributions using the rating information in the corresponding domain. The global server aggregation component is set to combine user characteristics across domains. To better extract semantic neighbors information among the users, we further provide compactness co-clustering strategy in FPPDM ++ to cluster the users with similar characteristics.

By an experimental analysis, we discover the semantic information of an augmented graph structure may be not consistent as original graph structure, and whether two augmented graphs are positive or negative pairs is highly related with the multi-scale structures. Based on this finding, we propose a multi-scale subgraph contrastive learning architecture which is able to characterize the fine-grained semantic information. Specifically, we generate global and local views at different scales based on subgraph sampling, and construct multiple contrastive relationships according to their semantic associations to provide richer self-supervised signals.

Specifically, for each interaction, we present an evolution learning module to continuously update the dynamic states of the related users and cascade based on their currently encoded messages and previous dynamic states.

    "abstract": "To alleviate the burden of software maintenance, bug localization, which aims to automatically locate the buggy source files based on the bug report, has drawn significant attention in the software mining community. Recent studies indicate that the program structure in source code carries more semantics reflecting the program behavior, which is beneficial for bug localization. Benefiting from the rich structural information in the Control Flow Graph (CFG), CFG-based bug localization methods have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Existing CFG-based methods extract the semantic feature from the CFG via the graph neural network. However, the step-wise feature propagation in the graph neural network suffers from the problem of information loss when the propagation distance is long, while the long-distance dependency is rather common in the CFG. In this paper, we argue that the long-distance dependency is crucial for feature extraction from the CFG, and propose a novel bug localization model named sgAttention. In sgAttention, a particularly designed structural-guided attention is employed to globally capture the information in the CFG, where features of irrelevant nodes are masked for each node to facilitate better feature extraction from the CFG. Experimental results on four widely-used open-source software projects indicate that sgAttention averagely improves the state-of-the-art bug localization methods by 32.9\\% and 29.2\\% and the state-of-the-art pre-trained models by 5.8\\%  and 4.9\\% in terms of MAP and MRR, respectively",

    "title": "Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Traffic Signal Control under Missing Data",
    "abstract": "The emergence of reinforcement learning (RL) methods in traffic signal control (TSC) tasks has achieved promising results. Most RL approaches require the observation of the environment for the agent to decide which action is optimal for a long-term reward. However, in real-world urban scenarios, missing observation of traffic states may frequently occur due to the lack of sensors, which makes existing RL methods inapplicable on road networks with missing observation. In this work, we aim to control the traffic signals in a real-world setting, where some of the intersections in the road network are not installed with sensors and thus with no direct observations around them. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use RL methods to tackle the TSC problem in this real-world setting. Specifically, we propose two solutions: 1) imputes the traffic states to enable adaptive control. 2) imputes both states and rewards to enable adaptive control and the training of RL agents. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world road network traffic, we reveal that our method outperforms conventional approaches and performs consistently with different missing rates. We also investigate how missing data influences the performance of our model",

    "title": "Discriminative-Invariant Representation Learning for Unbiased Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Selection bias hinders recommendation models from learning unbiased user preference. Recent works empirically reveal that pursuing invariant user and item representation across biased and unbiased data is crucial for counteracting selection bias. However, our theoretical analysis reveals that simply optimizing representation invariance is insufficient for addressing the selection bias — recommendation performance is bounded by both representation invariance and discriminability. Worse still, current invariant representation learning methods in recommendation neglect even hurt the representation discriminability due to data sparsity and label shift. In this light, we propose a new Discriminative-Invariant Representation Learning framework for unbiased recommendation, which incorporates label-conditional clustering and prior-guided contrasting into conventional invariant representation learning to mitigate the impact of data sparsity and label shift, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, validating the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed framework.

    "title": "Semi-supervised Domain Adaptation in Graph Transfer Learning",
    "abstract": "As a specific case of graph transfer learning, unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs aims for knowledge transfer from label-rich source graphs to unlabeled target graphs. However, graphs with topology and attributes usually have considerable cross-domain disparity and there are numerous real-world scenarios where merely a subset of nodes are labeled in the source graph. This imposes critical challenges on graph transfer learning due to serious domain shifts and label scarcity. To address these challenges, we propose a method named Semi-supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA). To deal with the domain shift, we add adaptive shift parameters to each of the source nodes, which are trained in an adversarial manner to align the cross-domain distributions of node embedding. Thus, the node classifier trained on labeled source nodes can be transferred to the target nodes. Moreover, to address the label scarcity, we propose pseudo-labeling on unlabeled nodes, which improves classification on the target graph via measuring the posterior influence of nodes based on their relative position to the class centroids. Finally, extensive experiments on a range of publicly accessible datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed SGDA in different experimental settings",

    "abstract": "User review data is considered as auxiliary information to alleviate the data sparsity problem and improve the quality of learned user/item or interaction representations in review-based recommender systems. However, existing methods usually model user-item interactions in a holistic manner and neglect the entanglement of the latent intents behind them, e.g., price, quality, or appearance, resulting in suboptimal representations and reducing interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Graph Disentangled Networks for review-based recommendation (SGDN), to separately model the user-item interactions based on the latent factors through the textual review data. To this end, we first model the distributions of interactions over latent factors from both semantic information in review data and structural information in user-item graph data, forming several factor graphs. Then a factorized message passing mechanism is designed to learn disentangled user/item and interaction representations on the factor graphs. Finally, we set an intent-aware contrastive learning task to alleviate the sparsity issue and encourage disentanglement through dynamically identifying positive and negative samples based on the learned intent distributions. Empirical results over five benchmark datasets validate the superiority of  SGDN over the state-of-the-art methods and the  interpretability of learned intent factors",

    "abstract": "Graph clustering is a longstanding research topic, and has achieved remarkable success with the deep learning methods in recent years. Nevertheless, we observe that several important issues largely remain open. On the one hand, graph clustering from the geometric perspective is appealing but has rarely been touched before, as it lacks a promising space for geometric clustering. On the other hand, contrastive learning boosts the deep graph clustering but usually struggles in either graph augmentation or hard sample mining. To bridge this gap, we rethink the problem of graph clustering from geometric perspective and, to the best of our knowledge, make the first attempt to introduce a heterogeneous curvature space to graph clustering problem. Correspondingly, we present a novel end-to-end contrastive graph clustering model named CONGREGATE, addressing geometric graph clustering with Ricci curvatures. To support geometric clustering, we construct a theoretically grounded Heterogeneous Curvature Space where deep representations are generated via the product of the proposed fully Riemannian graph convolutional nets. Thereafter, we train the graph clusters by an augmentation-free reweighted contrastive approach where we pay more attention to both hard negatives and hard positives in our curvature space. Empirical results on real-world graphs show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection aims to distinguish abnormal instances that deviate significantly from the majority of benign ones. As instances that appear in the real world are naturally connected and can be represented with graphs, graph neural networks become increasingly popular in tackling the anomaly detection problem. Despite the promising results, research on anomaly detection has almost exclusively focused on static graphs while the mining of anomalous patterns from dynamic graphs is rarely studied but has significant application value. In addition, anomaly detection is typically tackled from semi-supervised perspectives due to the lack of sufficient labeled data. However, most proposed methods are limited to merely exploiting labeled data, leaving a large number of unlabeled samples unexplored. In this work, we present semi-supervised anomaly detection (SAD), an end-to-end framework for anomaly detection on dynamic graphs. By a combination of a time-equipped memory bank and a pseudo-label contrastive learning module, SAD is able to fully exploit the potential of large unlabeled samples and uncover underlying anomalies on evolving graph streams. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that SAD efficiently discovers anomalies from dynamic graphs and outperforms existing advanced methods even when provided with only little labeled data",

However, while variants of attention-based GNNs are setting new benchmarks for numerous real-world datasets, recent works have pointed out that their induced attentions are less robust and generalizable against noisy graphs due to lack of direct supervision. In this paper, we present a new framework which utilizes the tool of causality to provide a powerful supervision signal for the learning process of attention functions. Specifically, we estimate the direct causal effect of attention to the final prediction, and then maximize such effect to guide attention attending to more meaningful neighbors. Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module for any canonical attention-based GNNs in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets illustrated that, by directly supervising attention functions, the model is able to converge faster with a clearer decision boundary, and thus yields better performances",

    "abstract": "Social recommendation is gaining increasing attention in various online applications, including e-commerce and online streaming, where social information is leveraged to improve user-item interaction modeling. Recently, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has proven to be remarkably effective in addressing data sparsity through augmented learning tasks. Inspired by this, researchers have attempted to incorporate SSL into social recommendation by supplementing the primary supervised task with social-aware self-supervised signals. However, social information can be unavoidably noisy in characterizing user preferences due to the ubiquitous presence of interest-irrelevant social connections, such as colleagues or classmates who do not share many common interests. To address this challenge, we propose a novel social recommender called the Denoised Self-Augmented Learning paradigm (DSL). Our model not only preserves helpful social relations to enhance user-item interaction modeling but also enables personalized cross-view knowledge transfer through adaptive semantic alignment in embedding space.

    "abstract": "Open knowledge graph (OpenKG) link prediction aims to predict missing factual triples in the form of (head noun phrase, relation phrase, tail noun phrase). Since triples are not canonicalized, previous methods either focus on canonicalizing noun phrases (NPs) to reduce graph sparsity, or utilize textual forms to improve type compatibility. However, they neglect to canonicalize relation phrases (RPs) and triples, making OpenKG maintain high sparsity and impeding the performance. To address the above issues, we propose a Canonicalization-Enhanced Known Fact-Aware (CEKFA) framework that boosts link prediction performance through sparsity reduction of RPs and triples. First, we propose a similarity-driven RP canonicalization method to reduce RPs' sparsity by sharing knowledge of semantically similar ones. Second, to reduce the sparsity of triples, a known fact-aware triple canonicalization method is designed to retrieve relevant known facts from training data. Finally, these two types of canonical information are integrated into a general two-stage re-ranking framework that can be applied to most existing knowledge graph embedding methods. Experiment results on two OpenKG datasets, ReVerb20K and ReVerb45K, show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Graph neural network (GNN) based recommender systems have become one of the mainstream trends due to the powerful learning ability from user behavior data. Understanding the user intents from behavior data is the key to recommender systems, which poses two basic requirements for GNN-based recommender systems. One is how to learn complex and diverse intents especially when the user behavior is usually inadequate in reality. The other is different behaviors have different intent distributions, so how to establish their relations for a more explainable  recommender system. In this paper, we present the Intent-aware Recommendation via Disentangled Graph Contrastive Learning (IDCL), which simultaneously learns interpretable intents and behavior distributions over those intents. Specifically, we first model the user behavior data as a user-item-concept graph, and design a GNN based behavior disentangling module to learn the different intents. Then we propose the intent-wise contrastive learning to enhance the intent disentangling and meanwhile infer the behavior distributions. Finally, the coding rate reduction regularization is introduced to make the behaviors of different intents orthogonal.

    "abstract": "Click-through Rate (CTR) prediction in real-world recommender systems often deals with billions of user interactions every day. To improve the training efficiency, it is common to update the CTR prediction model incrementally using the new incremental data and a subset of historical data. However, the feature embeddings of a CTR prediction model often get stale when the corresponding features do not appear in current incremental data. In the next period, the model would have a performance degradation on samples containing stale features, which we call the feature staleness problem. To mitigate this problem, we propose a Feature Staleness Aware Incremental Learning method for CTR prediction (FeSAIL) which adaptively replays samples containing stale features. We first introduce a staleness-aware sampling algorithm (SAS) to sample a fixed number of stale samples with high sampling efficiency. We then introduce a staleness-aware regularization mechanism (SAR) for a fine-grained control of the feature embedding updating. We instantiate FeSAIL with a general deep learning-based CTR prediction model and the experimental results demonstrate FeSAIL outperforms various state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Recently, Zero-Shot Node Classification (ZNC) has been an emerging and crucial task in graph data analysis. This task aims to predict nodes from unseen classes which are unobserved in the training process. Existing work mainly utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to associate features' prototypes and labels' semantics thus enabling knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. However, the multi-faceted semantic orientation in the feature-semantic alignment has been neglected by previous work, i.e. the content of a node usually covers diverse topics that are relevant to the semantics of multiple labels. It's necessary to separate and judge the semantic factors that tremendously affect the cognitive ability to improve the generality of models. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Multi-Faceted framework (KMF) that enhances the richness of label semantics via the extracted KG (Knowledge Graph)-based topics. And then the content of each node is reconstructed to a topic-level representation that offers multi-faceted and fine-grained semantic relevancy to different labels. Due to the particularity of the graph's instance (i.e., node) representation, a novel geometric constraint is developed to alleviate the problem of prototype drift caused by node information aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on several public graph datasets and design an application of zero-shot cross-domain recommendation. The quantitative results demonstrate both the effectiveness and generalization of KMF with the comparison of state-of-the-art baselines",

Additionally, it categorizes GTs into three distinct types and provides tailored accelerating methods for each category to encompass all types of GTs. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the performance gap between KDLGT and self-attention to ensure its effectiveness. Under this framework, we select two representative GTs to design our models.

A variety of anomaly detection methods have been proposed, and a category based on the isolation forest mechanism stands out due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and efficiency, e.g., iForest is often employed as a state-of-the-art detector for real deployment. While the majority of isolation forests use the binary structure, a framework LSHiForest has demonstrated that the multi-fork isolation tree structure can lead to better detection performance. However, there is no theoretical work answering the fundamentally and practically important question on the optimal tree structure for an isolation forest with respect to the branching factor. In this paper, we establish a theory on isolation efficiency to answer the question and determine the optimal branching factor for an isolation tree. Based on the theoretical underpinning, we design a practical optimal isolation forest OptIForest incorporating clustering based learning to hash which enables more information to be learned from data for better isolation quality. The rationale of our approach relies on a better bias-variance trade-off achieved by bias reduction in OptIForest.

Meanwhile, we also connect all the repeated items in the same basket as a hyperedge, whereby their correlations can be further strengthened. We generate a negative (positive) view of the basket by data augmentation on repeated (non-repeated) items, and apply contrastive learning to force more agreements on repeated items.

Recent neural-symbolic SR models demonstrate their potential to enable SR to be equipped with concurrent perception and cognition capacities. However, neural-symbolic SR remains a challenging problem due to open issues like representing users and items in logical reasoning. In this paper, we combine the Deep Neural Network (DNN) SR models with logical reasoning and propose a general framework named Sequential Recommendation with Probabilistic Logical Reasoning (short for SR-PLR). This framework allows SR-PLR to benefit from both similarity matching and logical reasoning by disentangling feature embedding and logic embedding in the DNN and probabilistic logic network. To better capture the uncertainty and evolution of user tastes, SR-PLR embeds users and items with a probabilistic method and conducts probabilistic logical reasoning on users' interaction patterns.  Then the feature and logic representations learned from the DNN and logic network are concatenated to make the prediction.

Previous methods usually model sequential check-in information of users to learn POI features for annotation. However, users' check-ins are hardly obtained in reality, especially for those newly created POIs. In this context, we present a Spatial-Textual POI Annotation (STPA) model for static POIs, which derives POI categories using only the geographic locations and names of POIs. Specifically, we design a GCN-based spatial encoder to model spatial correlations among POIs to generate POI spatial embeddings, and an attention-based text encoder to model the semantic contexts of POIs to generate POI textual embeddings. We finally fuse the two embeddings and preserve multi-view correlations for semantic annotation. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of STPA with POI data from AMap. Experimental results demonstrate that STPA substantially outperforms several competitive baselines, which proves that STPA is a promising approach for annotating static POIs in map services",

Existing inference methods require a large number of labels for training, which is hard to meet in practice. In this paper, we study a more practical yet challenging setting—contextual inference using mobility data with minimal supervision (i.e., a few labels per class and massive unlabeled data). A typical solution is to apply semi-supervised methods that follow a self-training framework to bootstrap a model based on all features. However, using a limited labeled set brings high risk of overfitting to self-training, leading to unsatisfactory performance. We propose a novel collaborative distillation framework STCOLAB. It sequentially trains spatial and temporal modules at each iteration following the supervision of ground-truth labels. In addition, it distills knowledge to the module being trained using the logits produced by the latest trained module of the other modality, thereby mutually calibrating the two modules and combining the knowledge from both modalities. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show STCOLAB achieves significantly more accurate contextual inference than various baselines",

    "title": "Towards Hierarchical Policy Learning for Conversational Recommendation with Hypergraph-based Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) aim to timely and proactively acquire user dynamic preferred attributes through conversations for item recommendation. In each turn of CRS, there naturally have two decision-making processes with different roles that influence each other: 1) director, which is to select the follow-up option (i.e., ask or recommend) that is more effective for reducing the action space and acquiring user preferences; and 2) actor, which is to accordingly choose primitive actions (i.e., asked attribute or recommended item) to estimate the effectiveness of the director’s option. However, existing methods heavily rely on a unified decision-making module or heuristic rules, while neglecting to distinguish the roles of different decision procedures, as well as the mutual influences between them. To address this, we propose a novel Director-Actor Hierarchical Conversational Recommender (DAHCR), where the director selects the most effective option, followed by the actor accordingly choosing primitive actions that satisfy user preferences. Specifically, we develop a dynamic hypergraph to model user preferences and introduce an intrinsic motivation to train from weak supervision over the director. Finally, to alleviate the bad effect of model bias on the mutual influence between the director and actor, we model the director’s option by sampling from a categorical distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAHCR outperforms state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Online Harmonizing Gradient Descent for Imbalanced Data Streams One-Pass Classification",
    "abstract": "Many real-world streaming data are sequentially collected over time and with skew-distributed classes. In this situation, online learning models may tend to favor samples from majority classes, making the wrong decisions for those from minority classes. Previous methods try to balance the instance number of different classes or assign asymmetric cost values. They usually require data-buffers to store streaming data or pre-defined cost parameters. This study alternatively shows that the imbalance of instances can be implied by the imbalance of gradients. Then, we propose the Online Harmonizing Gradient Descent (OHGD) for one-pass online classification. By harmonizing the gradient magnitude occurred by different classes, the method avoids the bias of the proposed method in favor of the majority class. Specifically, OHGD requires no data-buffer, extra parameters, or prior knowledge. It also handles imbalanced data streams the same way that it would handle balanced data streams, which facilitates its easy implementation. On top of a few common and mild assumptions, the theoretical analysis proves that OHGD enjoys a satisfying sub-linear regret bound. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness in handling imbalanced data streams",

    "title": "Totally Dynamic Hypergraph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Recent dynamic hypergraph neural networks (DHGNNs) are designed to adaptively optimize the hypergraph structure to avoid the dependence on the initial hypergraph structure, thus capturing more hidden information for representation learning. However, most existing DHGNNs cannot adjust the hyperedge number and thus fail to fully explore the underlying hypergraph structure. This paper proposes a new method, namely, totally hypergraph neural network (TDHNN), to adjust the hyperedge number for optimizing the hypergraph structure. Specifically, the proposed method first captures hyperedge feature distribution to obtain dynamical hyperedge features rather than fixed ones, by conducting the sampling from the learned distribution.\r\nThe hypergraph is then constructed based on the attention coefficients of both sampled hyperedges and nodes. The node features are dynamically updated by designing a simple hypergraph convolution algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, compared to SOTA methods. The source code can be accessed via https://github.com/HHW-zhou/TDHNN",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible goods among n agents with additive valuations, using the popular fairness notion of maximin share (MMS). Since MMS allocations do not always exist, a series of works provided existence and algorithms for approximate MMS allocations. The Garg-Taki algorithm gives the current best approximation factor of (3/4 + 1/12n). Most of these results are based on complicated analyses, especially those providing better than 2/3 factor. Moreover, since no tight example is known of the Garg-Taki algorithm, it is unclear if this is the best factor of this approach. In this paper, we significantly simplify the analysis of this algorithm and also improve the existence guarantee to a factor of (3/4 + min(1/36, 3/(16n-4))). For small n, this provides a noticeable improvement. Furthermore, we present a tight example of this algorithm, showing that this may be the best factor one can hope for with the current techniques",

    "abstract": "We study fair division of indivisible chores among n agents with additive disutility functions. Two well-studied fairness notions for indivisible items are envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1/EFX) and the standard notion of economic efficiency is Pareto optimality (PO). There is a noticeable gap between the results known for both EF1 and EFX in the goods and chores settings. The case of chores turns out to be much more challenging. We reduce this gap by providing slightly relaxed versions of the known results on goods for the chores setting. Interestingly, our algorithms run in polynomial time, unlike their analogous versions in the goods setting.  \r\n\r\nWe introduce the concept of k surplus in the chores setting which means that up to k more chores are allocated to the agents and each of them is a copy of an original chore. We present a polynomial-time algorithm which gives EF1 and PO allocations with n-1 surplus. \r\n    \r\nWe relax the notion of EFX slightly and define tEFX which requires that the envy from agent i to agent j is removed upon the transfer of any chore from the i's bundle to j's bundle. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that in the chores case for 3 agents returns an allocation which is either proportional or tEFX. Note that proportionality is a very strong criterion in the case of indivisible items, and hence both notions we guarantee are desirable",

    "title": "Non-Obvious Manipulability in Extensive-Form Mechanisms: The Revelation Principle for Single-Parameter Agents",
    "abstract": "Recent work in algorithmic mechanism design focuses on designing mechanisms for agents with bounded rationality, modifying the constraints that must be satisfied in order to achieve incentive compatibility.  Starting with Li's strengthening of strategyproofness, obvious strategyproofness (OSP) requires truthtelling to be \"obvious\" over dishonesty, roughly meaning that the worst outcome from truthful actions must be no worse than the best outcome for dishonest ones. A celebrated result for dominant-strategy incentive-compatible mechanisms that allows us to restrict attention to direct mechanisms, known as the revelation principle, does not hold for OSP: the implementation details matter for the obvious incentive properties of the mechanism. Studying agent strategies in real-life mechanisms, Troyan and Morrill introduce a relaxation of strategyproofness known as non-obvious manipulability, which only requires comparing certain extrema of the agents' utility functions in order for a mechanism to be incentive-compatible. Specifically a mechanism is not obviously manipulable (NOM) if the best and worst outcomes when acting truthfully are no worse than the best and worst outcomes when acting dishonestly. In this work we first extend the cycle monotonicity framework for direct-revelation NOM mechanism design to indirect mechanisms. We then apply this to two settings, single-parameter agents and mechanisms for two agents in which one has a two-value domain, and show that under these models the revelation principle holds: direct mechanisms are just as powerful as indirect ones",

    "title": "Temporal Network Creation Games",
    "abstract": "Most networks are not static objects, but instead they change over time. This observation has sparked rigorous research on temporal graphs within the last years. In temporal graphs, we have a fixed set of nodes and the connections between them are only available at certain time steps. This gives rise to a plethora of algorithmic problems on such graphs, most prominently the problem of finding temporal spanners, i.e., the computation of subgraphs that guarantee all pairs reachability via temporal paths. To the best of our knowledge, only centralized approaches for the solution of this problem are known. However, many real-world networks are not shaped by a central designer but instead they emerge and evolve by the interaction of many strategic agents. This observation is the driving force of the recent intensive research on game-theoretic network formation models.      \r\n\r\nIn this work we bring together these two recent research directions: temporal graphs and game-theoretic network formation. As a first step into this new realm, we focus on a simplified setting where a complete temporal host graph is given and the agents, corresponding to its nodes, selfishly create incident edges to ensure that they can reach all other nodes via temporal paths in the created network. This yields temporal spanners as equilibria of our game. We prove results on the convergence to and the existence of equilibrium networks, on the complexity of finding best agent strategies, and on the quality of the equilibria. By taking these first important steps, we uncover challenging open problems that call for an in-depth exploration of the creation of temporal graphs by strategic agents",

This phenomenon is widely known as residential segregation and has been studied extensively. Fifty years ago, Schelling proposed a landmark model that explains residential segregation in an elegant agent-based way. A recent stream of papers analyzed Schelling's model using game-theoretic approaches. However, all these works considered models with a given number of discrete types modeling different ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nWe focus on segregation caused by non-categorical attributes, such as household income or position in a political left-right spectrum. For this, we consider agent types that can be represented as real numbers. This opens up a great variety of reasonable models and, as a proof of concept, we focus on several natural candidates. In particular, we consider agents that evaluate their location by the average type-difference or the maximum type-difference to their neighbors, or by having a certain tolerance range for type-values of neighboring agents.We study the existence and computation of equilibria and provide bounds on the Price of Anarchy and Stability.

After inspection, A proposes one of the options, and P can accept or reject. In this paper, we study a natural online variant of delegation, in which the agent searches through the options in an online fashion. How can we design algorithms for P that approximate the utility of her best option in hindsight?\r\n\r\nWe show that P can obtain a Θ(1/n)-approximation and provide more fine-grained bounds independent of n based on two parameters. If the ratio of maximum and minimum utility for A is bounded by a factor α, we obtain an Ω(log log α / log α)-approximation algorithm and show that this is best possible. If P cannot distinguish options with the same value for herself, we show that ratios polynomial in 1/α cannot be avoided. If the utilities of P and A for each option are related by a factor β, we obtain an Ω(1 / log β)-approximation, and O(log log β / log β) is best possible",

    "abstract": "We consider a multi-issue election setting over a set of possibly interdependent issues with the goal of achieving proportional representation of the views of the electorate. To this end, we employ a proportionality criterion suggested recently in the literature, that guarantees fair representation for all groups of voters of sufficient size. For this criterion, there exist rules that perform well in the case where all the issues have a binary domain and are independent of each other. In particular, this has been shown for Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and for the Method of Equal Shares (MES). In this paper, we go two steps further: we generalize these guarantees for issues with a non-binary domain, and, most importantly, we consider extensions to elections with dependencies among issues, where we identify restrictions that lead to analogous results. To achieve this, we define appropriate generalizations of PAV and MES to handle conditional ballots. In addition to proportionality considerations, we also examine the computational properties of the conditional version of MES. Our findings indicate that the conditional case poses additional challenges and differs significantly from the unconditional one, both in terms of proportionality guarantees and computational complexity",

This scenario is particularly relevant in a Web3 environment, where no verification of the adjudication outcome is possible, and the appointed agents are, in principle, indifferent to the final verdict. We consider simple adjudication mechanisms that use (1) majority voting to decide the final verdict and (2) a payment function to reward the agents with the majority vote and possibly punish the ones in the minority. Agents interact with such a mechanism strategically: they exert some effort to understand how to properly judge the dispute and cast a yes/no vote that depends on this understanding and on information they have about the rest of the votes. Eventually, they vote so that their utility (i.e., their payment from the mechanism minus the cost due to their effort) is maximized. Under reasonable assumptions about how an agent's effort is related to her understanding of the dispute, we show that appropriate payment functions can be used to recover the correct adjudication outcome with high probability. Our findings follow from a detailed analysis of the induced strategic game and make use of both theoretical arguments and simulation experiments",

Furthermore, today we know that MMS allocations are not always guaranteed to exist. These facts weaken the usefulness of both EFX and MMS, albeit their appealing conceptual characteristics. \r\n\r\nWe propose two alternative fairness concepts—called epistemic EFX (EEFX) and minimum EFX value fairness (MXS)---inspired by EFX and MMS.

The task is to assign each agent to a distinct vertex in the seat graph such that either the sum of utilities or the minimum utility is maximized, or it is envy-free or exchange-stable. Aiming at identifying hard and easy cases, we extensively study the algorithmic complexity of the four problems by looking into natural graph classes for the seat graph (e.g., paths, cycles, stars, or matchings), problem-specific parameters (e.g., the number of non-isolated vertices in the seat graph or the maximum number of agents towards whom an agent has non-zero preferences), and preference structures (e.g., non-negative or symmetric preferences).

The best upper bound on R(d) is improved in a series of works to O(d^4), O(d^(2+o(1))), and finally to O(d^2). Also, via a simple observation, we have R(d) ∈ Ω(d).\r\nIn this paper, we introduce another problem in extremal combinatorics. For a parameter l, we define the rainbow path degree and denote it by H(l). We show that any lower bound on H(l) yields an upper bound on R(d). Next, we prove that H(l) ∈ Ω(l^2 / log(l)) which yields an almost tight upper bound of R(d) ∈ Ω(d.log(d)).  This, in turn, proves the existence of (1−ϵ)-EFX allocation with O_ϵ(√n .log(n)) number of discarded goods. In addition, for the special case of the Rainbow Cycle problem that the edges in each part form a permutation, we improve the upper bound to R(d) ≤ 2d−4. We leverage H(l) to achieve this bound.\r\nOur conjecture is that the exact value of H(l) is ⌊l^2/2⌋ − 1. We provide some experiments that support this conjecture. Assuming this conjecture is correct, we have R(d) ∈ θ(d)",

Most existing approaches that infer agents' private information from observable data either rely on strong equilibrium assumptions or require a careful design of agents' behavior models. To overcome these weaknesses, we propose a Bayesian Learning-based Valuation Inference (BLUE) framework. Our key idea is to derive feasible intervals of bargainers' private valuations from their behavior data, using the fact that most bargainers do not choose strictly dominated strategies. We leverage these feasible intervals to guide our inference. Specifically, we first model each bargainer's behavior function (which maps his valuation and bargaining history to decisions) via a recurrent neural network. Second, we learn these behavior functions by utilizing a novel loss function defined based on feasible intervals. Third, we derive the posterior distributions of bargainers' valuations according to their behavior data and learned behavior functions. Moreover, we account for the heterogeneity of bargainer behaviors, and propose a clustering algorithm (K-Loss) to improve the efficiency of learning these behaviors.

    "title": "Complexity of Efficient Outcomes in Binary-Action Polymatrix Games and Implications for Coordination Problems",
    "abstract": "We investigate the difficulty of finding economically efficient solutions to coordination problems on graphs. Our work focuses on two forms of coordination problem: pure-coordination games and anti-coordination games. We consider three objectives in the context of simple binary-action polymatrix games: (i) maximizing welfare, (ii) maximizing potential, and (iii) finding a welfare-maximizing Nash equilibrium. We introduce an intermediate, new graph-partition problem, termed MWDP, which is of independent interest, and we provide a  complexity dichotomy for it. This dichotomy, among other results, provides as a corollary a dichotomy for Objective (i) for general binary-action polymatrix games. In addition, it reveals that the complexity of achieving these objectives varies depending on the form of the coordination problem. Specifically, Objectives (i) and (ii) can be efficiently solved in pure-coordination games, but are NP-hard in anti-coordination games. Finally, we show that objective (iii) is NP-hard even for simple non-trivial pure-coordination games",

It can be costly and difficult for the players to reach an agreement through direct communication. However, with a mediator as a trusted third party, both players can communicate privately with the mediator without worrying about leaking too much or too little information. The mediator can design and commit to a multi-round communication protocol for both players, in which they update their beliefs about the other player's type. The mediator cannot force the players to trade but can influence their behaviors by sending messages to them.\r\n\r\nWe study the problem of designing revenue-maximizing mechanisms for the mediator. We show that the mediator can, without loss of generality, focus on a set of direct and incentive-compatible mechanisms.

    "title": "Strategic Resource Selection with Homophilic Agents",
    "abstract": "The strategic selection of resources  by selfish agents is a classical research direction, with Resource Selection Games and Congestion Games as prominent examples. In these games, agents select available resources and their utility then depends on the number of agents using the same resources. This implies that there is no distinction between the agents, i.e., they are anonymous.\r\n\r\nWe depart from this very general setting by proposing Resource Selection Games with heterogeneous agents that strive for a joint resource usage with similar agents. So, instead of the number of other users of a given resource, our model considers agents with different types and the decisive feature is the fraction of same-type agents among the users. More precisely, similarly to Schelling Games, there is a tolerance threshold tau in [0,1] which specifies the agents' desired minimum fraction of same-type agents on a resource. Agents strive to select resources where at least a tau-fraction of those resources' users have the same type as themselves. For tau=1, our model generalizes hedonic diversity games with single-peaked utilities with a peak at 1. \r\n\r\nFor our general model, we consider the existence and quality of equilibria and the complexity of maximizing the social welfare. Additionally, we consider a bounded rationality model, where agents can only estimate the utility of a resource, since they only know the fraction of same-type agents on a given resource, but not the exact numbers. Thus, they cannot know the impact a strategy change would have on a target resource. Interestingly, we show that this type of bounded rationality yields favorable game-theoretic properties and specific equilibria closely approximate equilibria of the full knowledge setting",

Quantifying the relative impact of variables on the truth value by means of importance values can provide useful insights to steer system design and debugging. In this paper, we introduce a uniform framework for reasoning about such values, relying on a generic notion of importance value functions (IVFs). The class of IVFs is defined by axioms motivated from several notions of importance values introduced in the literature, including Ben-Or and Linial’s influence and Chockler, Halpern, and Kupferman’s notion of responsibility and blame. We establish a connection between IVFs and game-theoretic concepts such as Shapley and Banzhaf values, both of which measure the impact of players on outcomes in cooperative games.

A prominent fairness notion for allocating indivisible items is envy-freeness up to any item (EFX). Yet, its existence and computation has remained a notable open problem. By identifying a class of instances with \"terrible chores\", we  show that determining the existence of an EFX allocation is NP-complete. This result immediately implies the intractability of EFX under additive preferences. Nonetheless, we propose a natural subclass of lexicographic preferences for which an EFX and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation is guaranteed to exist and can be computed efficiently for any mixed instance.

Unlike the fixed quota setting, we allow the number of applicants assigned to a post to fall outside the range.  This leads to assignments with deviation. Here, we study the problem of computing an assignment that has two orthogonal optimization objectives – minimizing the deviation (maximum or total) w.r.t. soft quotas and ensuring optimality w.r.t. preferences of applicants (rank-maximality or fairness). The order in which these objectives are considered, the different possibilities to optimize deviation combined with the well-studied notions of optimality w.r.t. preferences open up a range of optimization problems of practical importance.

    "title": "Deliberation and Voting in Approval-Based Multi-Winner Elections",
    "abstract": "Citizen-focused democratic processes where participants deliberate on alternatives and then vote to make the final decision are increasingly popular today. While the computational social choice literature has extensively investigated voting rules, there is limited work that explicitly looks at the interplay of the deliberative process and voting. In this paper, we build a deliberation model using established models from the opinion-dynamics literature and study the effect of different deliberation mechanisms on voting outcomes achieved when using well-studied voting rules. Our results show that deliberation generally improves welfare and representation guarantees, but the results are sensitive to how the deliberation process is organized. We also show, experimentally, that simple voting rules, such as approval voting, perform as well as more sophisticated rules such as proportional approval voting or method of equal shares if deliberation is properly supported. This has ramifications on the practical use of such voting rules in citizen-focused democratic processes",

    "title": "Learning Efficient Truthful Mechanisms for Trading Networks",
    "abstract": "Trading networks are an indispensable part of today's economy, but to compete successfully with others, they must be efficient in maximizing the value they provide to the external market.  While the prior work relies on truthful disclosure of private information to achieve efficiency, we study the problem of designing mechanisms that result in efficient trading networks by incentivizing firms to truthfully reveal their private information to a third party. Additional desirable properties of such mechanisms are weak budget balance (WBB; the third party needs not invest) and individual rationality (IR; firms get non-negative utility).  Unlike combinatorial auctions, there may not exist mechanisms that simultaneously satisfy these properties ex post for trading networks.  We propose an approach for computing or learning truthful and efficient mechanisms for given networks in a Bayesian setting, where WBB and IR, respectively, are relaxed to ex ante and interim for a given distribution over the private information.  We incorporate techniques to reduce computational and sample complexity.  We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully finds the mechanisms with the relaxed properties for trading networks where achieving ex post properties is impossible",

All the prior work on indivisible PB assumes that each project has only one possible cost. In this work, we let each project have a set of permissible costs, each reflecting a possible degree of sophistication of the project. Each voter approves a range of costs for each project, by giving an upper and lower bound on the cost that she thinks the project deserves. The outcome of a PB rule selects a subset of projects and also specifies their corresponding costs. We study different utility notions and prove that the existing positive results when every project has exactly one permissible cost can also be extended to our framework where a project has several permissible costs. We also analyze the fixed parameter tractability of the problem. Finally, we propose some important and intuitive axioms and analyze their satisfiability by different PB rules.

Our findings relate those three solution concepts of a game to solution concepts of a polynomial maximization problem: global optima, optimal points with respect to subsets of variables and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) points. Based on these correspondences, we are able to settle various complexity-theoretic questions on the computation of such strategies.

Often these models are assumed to approximate a Euclidean structure, where an individual prefers alternatives positioned closer to their \"ideal point\", as measured by the Euclidean metric. However, previous work has shown there are ordinal preference profiles that cannot be represented with this structure if the Euclidean space has two fewer dimensions than there are individuals or alternatives. We extend this result, showing that there are situations in which almost all preference profiles cannot be represented with the Euclidean model, and derive a theoretical lower bound on the expected error when using the Euclidean model to approximate non-Euclidean preference profiles. Our results have implications for the interpretation and use of vector embeddings, because in some cases close approximation of arbitrary, true ordinal relationships can be expected only if the dimensionality of the embeddings is a substantial fraction of the number of entities represented",

    "title": "Truthful Auctions for Automated Bidding in Online Advertising",
    "abstract": "Automated bidding, an emerging intelligent decision-making paradigm powered by machine learning, has become popular in online advertising. Advertisers in automated bidding evaluate the cumulative utilities and have private financial constraints over multiple ad auctions in a long-term period. Based on these distinct features, we consider a new ad auction model for automated bidding: the values of advertisers are public while the financial constraints, such as budget and return on investment (ROI) rate, are private types. We derive the truthfulness conditions with respect to private constraints for this multi-dimensional setting, and demonstrate any feasible allocation rule could be equivalently reduced to a series of non-decreasing functions on budget. However, the resulted allocation mapped from these non-decreasing functions generally follows an irregular shape, making it difficult to obtain a closed-form expression for the auction objective. To overcome this design difficulty, we propose a family of truthful automated bidding auction with personalized rank scores, similar to the Generalized Second-Price (GSP) auction. The intuition behind our design is to leverage personalized rank scores as the criteria to allocate items, and compute a critical ROI to transforms the constraints on budget to the same dimension as ROI. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed auction mechanism outperforms the widely used ad auctions, such as first-price auction and second-price auction, in various automated bidding environments",

    "title": "Sequence Learning Using Equilibrium Propagation",
    "abstract": "Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a powerful and more bio-plausible alternative to conventional learning frameworks such as backpropagation. The effectiveness of EP stems from the fact that it relies only on local computations and requires solely one kind of computational unit during both of its training phases, thereby enabling greater applicability in domains such as bio-inspired neuromorphic computing. The dynamics of the model in EP is governed by an energy function and the internal states of the model consequently converge to a steady state following the state transition rules defined by the same. However, by definition, EP requires the input to the model (a convergent RNN) to be static in both the phases of training. Thus it is not possible to design a model for sequence classification using EP with an LSTM or GRU like architecture. In this paper, we leverage recent developments in modern hopfield networks to further understand energy based models and develop solutions for complex sequence classification tasks using EP while satisfying its convergence criteria and maintaining its theoretical similarities with recurrent backpropagation. We explore the possibility of integrating modern hopfield networks as an attention mechanism with convergent RNN models used in EP, thereby extending its applicability for the first time on two different sequence classification tasks in natural language processing viz. sentiment analysis (IMDB dataset) and natural language inference (SNLI dataset).

This paper introduces a black-box data poisoning attack framework that finds the optimal strategies for instance selection and labeling to attack unknown label aggregation models in crowdsourcing. We formulate the attack problem on top of a generic formalization of label aggregation models and then introduce a substitution approach that attacks a substitute aggregation model in replacement of the unknown model.

For example, on the RTE dataset, Dawid and Skene model performs significantly better than Majority Voting, while on the LableMe dataset, the experiments give the opposite conclusion. It is challenging to obtain comprehensive and balanced datasets at a low cost. To our best knowledge, little effort have been made to the fair evaluation of aggregation algorithms. To fill in this gap, we propose a novel method named TDG4Crowd  that can automatically generate comprehensive and balanced datasets.

Existing continual learning frameworks are usually applicable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and lack the exploration on more brain-inspired, energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Drawing on continual learning mechanisms during child growth and development, we propose Dynamic Structure Development of Spiking Neural Networks (DSD-SNN) for efficient and adaptive continual learning. When learning a sequence of tasks, the DSD-SNN dynamically assigns and grows new neurons to new tasks and prunes redundant neurons, thereby increasing memory capacity and reducing computational overhead. In addition, the overlapping shared structure helps to quickly leverage all acquired knowledge to new tasks, empowering a single network capable of supporting multiple incremental tasks (without the separate sub-network mask for each task). We validate the effectiveness of the proposed model on multiple class incremental learning and task incremental learning benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our model could significantly improve performance, learning speed and memory capacity, and reduce computational overhead. Besides, our DSD-SNN model achieves comparable performance with the DNNs-based methods, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for existing SNNs-based continual learning methods",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have increasingly drawn massive research attention due to biological interpretability and efficient computation. Recent achievements are devoted to utilizing the surrogate gradient (SG) method to avoid the dilemma of non-differentiability of spiking activity to directly train SNNs by backpropagation. However, the fixed width of the SG leads to gradient vanishing and mismatch problems, thus limiting the performance of directly trained SNNs. In this work, we propose a novel perspective to unlock the width limitation of SG, called the learnable surrogate gradient (LSG) method. The LSG method modulates the width of SG according to the change of the distribution of the membrane potentials, which is identified to be related to the decay factors based on our theoretical analysis. Then we introduce the trainable decay factors to implement the LSG method, which can optimize the width of SG automatically during training to avoid the gradient vanishing and mismatch problems caused by the limited width of SG. We evaluate the proposed LSG method on both image and neuromorphic datasets. Experimental results show that the LSG method can effectively alleviate the blocking of gradient propagation caused by the limited width of SG when training deep SNNs directly. Meanwhile, the LSG method can help SNNs achieve competitive performance on both latency and accuracy",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents is to collaborate with novel partners that were not encountered by them during the training phase. This is specifically worsened by an increased variance in action responses when the DRL agents collaborate with human partners due to the lack of consistency in human behaviors. Recent work have shown that training a single agent as the best response to a diverse population of training partners significantly increases an agent's robustness to novel partners. We further enhance the population-based training approach by introducing a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) based method for Human-AI Collaboration. Our agent is able to learn multiple best-response policies as its low-level policy while at the same time, it learns a high-level policy that acts as a manager which allows the agent to dynamically switch between the low-level best-response policies based on its current partner. We demonstrate that our method is able to dynamically adapt to novel partners of different play styles and skill levels in the 2-player collaborative Overcooked game environment.

    "abstract": "With the increased integration of AI technologies in human decision making processes, adversarial attacks on AI models become a greater concern than ever before as they may significantly hurt humans’ trust in AI models and decrease the effectiveness of human-AI collaboration. While many adversarial attack methods have been proposed to decrease the performance of an AI model, limited attention has been paid on understanding how these attacks will impact the human decision makers interacting with the model, and accordingly, how to strategically deploy adversarial attacks to maximize the reduction of human trust and reliance. In this paper, through a human-subject experiment, we first show that in AI-assisted decision making, the timing of the attacks largely influences how much humans decrease their trust in and reliance on AI—the decrease is particularly salient when attacks occur on decision making tasks that humans are highly confident themselves. Based on these insights, we next propose an algorithmic framework to infer the human decision maker’s hidden trust in the AI model and dynamically decide when the attacker should launch an attack to the model. Our evaluations show that following the proposed approach, attackers deploy more efficient attacks and achieve higher utility than adopting other baseline strategies",

    "abstract": "Humans continually expand their learned knowledge to new domains and learn new concepts without any interference with past learned experiences. In contrast, machine learning models perform poorly in a continual learning setting, where input data distribution changes over time. Inspired by the nervous system learning mechanisms, we develop a computational model that enables a deep neural network to learn new concepts and expand its learned knowledge to new domains incrementally in a continual learning setting. We rely on the Parallel Distributed Processing theory to encode abstract concepts in an embedding space in terms of a multimodal distribution. This embedding space is modeled by internal data representations in a hidden network layer. We also leverage the Complementary Learning Systems theory to equip the model with a memory mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting through implementing pseudo-rehearsal. Our model can generate pseudo-data points for experience replay and accumulate new experiences to past learned experiences without causing cross-task interference",

    "title": "A New ANN-SNN Conversion Method with High Accuracy, Low Latency and Good Robustness",
    "abstract": "Due to the advantages of low energy consumption, high robustness and fast inference speed, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with good biological interpretability and the potential to be applied on neuromorphic hardware, are regarded as the third generation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Despite having so many advantages, the biggest challenge encountered by spiking neural networks is training difficulty caused by the non-differentiability of spike signals. ANN-SNN conversion is an effective method that solves the training difficulty by converting parameters in ANNs to those in SNNs through a specific algorithm. However, the ANN-SNN conversion method also suffers from accuracy degradation and long inference time. In this paper, we reanalyzed the relationship between Integrate-and-Fire (IF) neuron model and ReLU activation function, proposed a StepReLU activation function more suitable for SNNs under membrane potential encoding, and used it to train ANNs. Then we converted the ANNs to SNNs with extremely small conversion error and introduced leakage mechanism to the SNNs and get the final models, which have high accuracy, low latency and good robustness, and have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on various datasets such as CIFAR and ImageNet",

    "title": "The Effects of AI Biases and Explanations on Human Decision Fairness: A Case Study of Bidding in Rental Housing Markets",
    "abstract": "The use of AI-based decision aids in diverse domains has inspired many empirical investigations into how AI models’ decision recommendations impact humans’ decision accuracy in AI-assisted decision making, while explorations on the impacts on humans’ decision fairness are largely lacking despite their clear importance. In this paper, using a real-world business decision making scenario—bidding in rental housing markets—as our testbed, we present an experimental study on understanding how the bias level of the AI-based decision aid as well as the provision of AI explanations affect the fairness level of humans’ decisions, both during and after their usage of the decision aid. Our results suggest that when people are assisted by an AI-based decision aid, both the higher level of racial biases the decision aid exhibits and surprisingly, the presence of AI explanations, result in more unfair human decisions across racial groups. Moreover, these impacts are partly made through triggering humans’ “disparate interactions” with AI. However, regardless of the AI bias level and the presence of AI explanations, when people return to make independent decisions after their usage of the AI-based decision aid, their decisions no longer exhibit significant unfairness across racial groups",

    "title": "Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention for Asynchronous Spiking Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "The brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) are receiving increasing attention due to their asynchronous event-driven characteristics and low power consumption. As attention mechanisms recently become an indispensable part of sequence dependence modeling, the combination of SNNs and attention mechanisms holds great potential for energy-efficient and high-performance computing paradigms. However, the existing works cannot benefit from both temporal-wise attention and the asynchronous characteristic of SNNs. To fully leverage the advantages of both SNNs and attention mechanisms, we propose an SNNs-based spatial-temporal self-attention (STSA) mechanism, which calculates the feature dependence across the time and space domains without destroying the asynchronous transmission properties of SNNs. To further improve the performance, we also propose a spatial-temporal relative position bias (STRPB) for STSA to consider the spatiotemporal position of spikes. Based on the STSA and STRPB, we construct a spatial-temporal spiking Transformer framework, named STS-Transformer, which is powerful and enables SNNs to work in an asynchronous event-driven manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular neuromorphic datasets and speech datasets, including DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and Google Speech Commands, and our experimental results can outperform other state-of-the-art models",

We show that if the agent has a (strong FOND) plan/strategy to achieve a goal/complete a task at the abstract level, and it can always execute the nondeterministic abstract actions to completion at the concrete level, then there exist a refinement of it that is a (strong FOND) plan/strategy to achieve the refinement of the goal/task at the concrete level",

    "abstract": "Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) are one of the most powerful generalizations of classical Dung-style argumentation frameworks (AFs).\r\nThe additional expressive power comes with an increase in computational complexity, namely one level up in the polynomial hierarchy in comparison to\r\ntheir AF counterparts. However, there is one important subclass, so-called bipolar ADFs (BADFs) which are as complex as classical AFs while offering strictly more modeling capacities. This property makes BADFs very attractive from a knowledge representation point of view and is the main reason why this class has received much attention recently. The semantics of ADFs rely on the Gamma-operator which takes as an input a three-valued interpretation and returns a new one. However, in order to obtain the output the original definition requires to consider any two-valued completion of a given three-valued interpretation. In this paper we formally prove that in case of BADFs we may bypass the computationally intensive procedure via applying Kleene's three-valued logic K. We therefore introduce the so-called bipolar disjunctive normal form which is simply a disjunctive normal form where any used atom possesses either a positive or a negative polarity. We then show that: First, this normal form is expressive enough to represent any BADF and secondly, the computation can be done via Kleene's K instead of dealing with two-valued completions. Inspired by the main correspondence result we present some first experiments showing the computational benefit of using Kleene",

While both of these data quality issues have been widely studied in isolation, our contribution is a holistic framework for jointly deduplicating and repairing data. Our REPLACE framework follows a declarative approach, utilizing logical rules to specify under which conditions a pair of entity references can or must be merged and logical constraints to specify consistency requirements. The semantics defines a space of solutions, each consisting of a set of merges to perform and a set of facts to delete, which can be further refined by applying optimality criteria. As there may be multiple optimal solutions, we use classical notions of possible and certain query answers to reason over the alternative solutions, and introduce a novel notion of most informative answer to obtain a more compact presentation of query results. We perform a detailed analysis of the data complexity of the central reasoning tasks of recognizing optimal solutions and (most informative) possible and certain answers, for each of the three notions of optimal solution and for both general and restricted specifications",

    "abstract": "Generalized planning (GP) studies the computation of general solutions for a set of planning problems. Computing general solutions with correctness guarantee has long been a key issue in GP. Abstractions are widely used to solve GP problems. For example, a popular abstraction model for GP is qualitative numeric planning (QNP), which extends classical planning with non-negative real variables that can be increased or decreased by some arbitrary amount. The refinement of correct solutions of sound abstractions are solutions with correctness guarantees for GP problems. More recent literature proposed a uniform abstraction framework for GP and gave model-theoretic definitions of sound and complete abstractions for GP problems. In this paper, based on the previous work, we explore automatic verification of sound abstractions for GP. Firstly, we present a proof-theoretic characterization for sound abstractions. Secondly, based on the characterization, we give a sufficient condition for sound abstractions with deterministic actions.   Then we study how to verify the sufficient condition when the abstraction models are bounded QNPs where integer variables can be incremented or decremented by one. To this end, we develop methods to handle counting and transitive closure, which are often used to define numerical variables. Finally, we implement a sound bounded QNP abstraction verification system and report experimental results on several domains",

Our main idea is to replace the second-order quantification step of classic circumscription with a series of (pointwise) local checks on all domain elements and their immediate neighbourhood. Our main positive results are for ontologies in DLs ALCIO and ALCI: we prove that for TBoxes of modal depth 1 (i.e. without nesting of existential or universal quantifiers) standard reasoning problems under pointwise circumscription are (co)NExpTime-complete and ExpTime-complete, respectively.

However, learning such an optimal DT from data is well-known to be NP-hard. To overcome this complexity barrier, Ordyniak and Szeider (AAAI 21) initiated the study of optimal DT learning under the parameterized complexity perspective. They showed that solution size (i.e., number of nodes or depth of the DT) is insufficient to obtain fixed-parameter tractability (FPT). Therefore, they proposed an FPT algorithm that utilizes two auxiliary parameters: the maximum difference (as a structural property of the data set) and maximum domain size. They left it as an open question of whether bounding the maximum domain size is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe main result of this paper answers this question.

The retrieval of these variables has been studied extensively in the disentanglement, causal representation learning, and independent component analysis fields. Recently, approaches merging these domains together have shown great success. Instead of directly representing the factors of variation, the problem of disentanglement can be seen as finding the interventions on one image that yield a change to a single factor. Following this assumption, we introduce a new method for disentanglement inspired by causal dynamics that combines causality theory with vector-quantized variational autoencoders. Our model considers the quantized vectors as causal variables and links them in a causal graph. It performs causal interventions on the graph and generates atomic transitions affecting a unique factor of variation in the image. We also introduce a new task of action retrieval that consists of finding the action responsible for the transition between two images. We test our method on standard synthetic and real-world disentanglement datasets. We show that it can effectively disentangle the factors of variation and perform precise interventions on high-level semantic attributes of an image without affecting its quality, even with imbalanced data distributions",

We lift these restrictions by introducing the framework of Relational Action Bases (RABs), which generalizes existing frameworks and in which unbounded relational states are evolved through actions that can (1) quantify both existentially and universally over the data, and (2) use arithmetic constraints. We then study parameterized safety of RABs via (approximated) SMT-based backward search, singling out essential meta-properties of the resulting procedure, and showing how it can be realized by an off-the-shelf combination of existing verification modules of the state-of-the-art MCMT model checker.

    "abstract": "The tractability of the lightweight description logic EL has allowed for the construction of large and widely used ontologies that support semantic interoperability. However, comprehensive domains with a broad user base are often at odds with strong axiomatisations otherwise useful for inferencing, since these are usually context dependent and subject to diverging perspectives.\r\n\r\nIn this paper we introduce Standpoint EL, a multi-modal extension of EL that allows for the integrated representation of domain knowledge relative to diverse, possibly conflicting standpoints (or contexts), which can be hierarchically organised and put in relation to each other. We establish that Standpoint EL still exhibits EL's favourable PTime standard reasoning, whereas introducing additional features like empty standpoints, rigid roles, and nominals makes standard reasoning tasks intractable",

We show that DatalogMTLE is undecidable even in the restricted cases of guarded and weakly-acyclic programs. To address this issue we introduce uniform semantics which, on the one hand, is well-suited for modelling temporal knowledge as it prevents from unintended value invention and, on the other hand, provides decidability of reasoning; in particular, it becomes 2-EXPSPACE-complete for weakly-acyclic programs but remains undecidable for guarded programs. We provide an implementation for the decidable case  and demonstrate its practical feasibility.\r\nThus we obtain an expressive, yet decidable,  rule-language and a system which is suitable for complex temporal reasoning with existential rules",

For instance, if the first-order sentence defines permutations then the generated integer sequence is the sequence of factorial numbers n!. We demonstrate that our approach is able to generate interesting new sequences by showing that a non-negligible fraction of the automatically generated sequences can actually be found in the Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) while generating many other similar sequences which are not present in OEIS and which are potentially interesting.

Our study provides an explanation for this paradox: instead of learning to emulate the correct reasoning function, BERT has, in fact, learned statistical features that inherently exist in logical reasoning problems. We also show that it is infeasible to jointly remove statistical features from data, illustrating the difficulty of learning to reason in general. Our result naturally extends to other neural models (e.g. T5) and unveils the fundamental difference between learning to reason and learning to achieve high performance on NLP benchmarks using statistical features",

Hypertree decompositions help identify efficient query plans and reduce similar redundancy in query answering. However, it is unclear how this can be applied to materialisation and incremental reasoning with recursive Datalog programs. Moreover, hypertree decompositions require additional data structures and thus introduce nonnegligible overhead in both runtime and memory consumption. In this paper, we provide algorithms that exploit hypertree decompositions for the materialisation and incremental evaluation of Datalog programs. Furthermore, we combine this approach with standard Datalog reasoning algorithms in a modular fashion so that the overhead caused by the decompositions is reduced.

    "title": "Building Concise Logical Patterns by Constraining Tsetlin Machine Clause Size",
    "abstract": "Tsetlin Machine (TM) is a logic-based machine learning approach with the crucial advantages of being transparent and hardware-friendly. While TMs match or surpass deep learning accuracy for an increasing number of applications, large clause pools tend to produce clauses with many literals (long clauses). As such, they become less interpretable. Further, longer clauses increase the switching activity of the clause logic in hardware, consuming more power. This paper introduces a novel variant of TM learning -- Clause Size Constrained TMs (CSC-TMs) --  where one can set a soft constraint on the clause size. As soon as a clause includes more literals than the constraint allows, it starts expelling literals. Accordingly, oversized clauses only appear transiently. To evaluate CSC-TM, we conduct classification, clustering, and regression experiments on tabular data, natural language text, images, and board games. Our results show that CSC-TM maintains accuracy with up to 80 times fewer literals. Indeed, the accuracy increases with shorter clauses for TREC and BBC Sports. After the accuracy peaks, it drops gracefully as the clause size approaches one literal. We finally analyze CSC-TM power consumption and derive new convergence properties",

    "abstract": "The safe application of reinforcement learning (RL) requires generalization from limited training data to unseen scenarios. Yet, fulfilling tasks under changing circumstances is a key challenge in RL. Current state-of-the-art approaches for generalization apply data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data. Even though this prevents overfitting to the training environment(s), it hinders policy optimization. Crafting a suitable observation, only containing crucial information, has been shown to be a challenging task itself. To improve data efficiency and generalization capabilities, we propose Compact Reshaped Observation Processing (CROP) to reduce the state information used for policy optimization. By providing only relevant information, overfitting to a specific training layout is precluded and generalization to unseen environments is improved. We formulate three CROPs that can be applied to fully observable observation- and action-spaces and provide methodical foundation.

    "abstract": "Few-shot learning which aims to generalize knowledge learned from annotated base training data to recognize unseen novel classes has attracted considerable attention. Existing few-shot methods rely on completely clean training data. However, in the real world, the training data are always corrupted and accompanied by noise due to the disturbance in data transmission and low-quality annotation, which severely degrades the performance and generalization capability of few-shot models. To address the problem, we propose a unified peer-collaboration learning (PCL) framework to extract valid knowledge from corrupted data for few-shot learning. PCL leverages two modules to mimic the peer collaboration process which cooperatively evaluates the importance of each sample. Specifically, each module first estimates the importance weights of different samples by encoding the information provided by the other module from both global and local perspectives. Then, both modules leverage the obtained importance weights to guide the reevaluation of the loss value of each sample. In this way, the peers can mutually absorb knowledge to improve the robustness of few-shot models. Experiments verify that our framework combined with different few-shot methods can significantly improve the performance and robustness of original models",

Furthermore, ReLiNet's computation can be reduced to a single linear model for each time step, resulting in predictions that are explainable by definition, thereby establishing trust from a human-centric perspective.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning's (RL) ubiquity has instigated research on potential threats to its training and deployment. Many works study single-learner training-time attacks that \"pre-programme\" behavioral triggers into a strategy. However, attacks on collections of learning agents remain largely overlooked. We remedy the situation by developing a constructive training-time attack on a population of learning agents and additionally make the attack agnostic to the population's size. The attack constitutes a sequence of environment (re)parameterizations (poisonings), generated to overcome individual differences between agents and lead the entire population to the same target behavior while minimizing effective environment modulation. Our method is demonstrated on populations of independent learners in \"ghost\" environments (learners do not interact or perceive each other) as well as environments with mutual awareness, with or without individual learning. From the attack perspective, we pursue an ultra-blackbox setting, i.e., the attacker's training utilizes only across-policy traces of the victim learners for both attack conditioning and evaluation. The resulting uncertainty in population behavior is managed via a novel Wasserstein distance-based Gaussian embedding of behaviors detected within the victim population. To align with prior works on environment poisoning, our experiments are based on a 3D Grid World domain and show:  a) feasibility, i.e., despite the uncertainty, the attack forces a population-wide adoption of target behavior; b) efficacy, i.e., the attack is size-agnostic and transferable.

    "title": "Lifelong Multi-view Spectral Clustering",
    "abstract": "In recent years, spectral clustering has become a well-known and effective algorithm in machine learning. However, traditional spectral clustering algorithms are designed for single-view data and fixed task setting. This can become a limitation when dealing with new tasks in a sequence, as it requires accessing previously learned tasks. Hence it leads to high storage consumption, especially for multi-view datasets. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a lifelong multi-view clustering framework. Our approach uses view-specific knowledge libraries to capture intra-view knowledge across different tasks. Specifically, we propose two types of libraries: an orthogonal basis library that stores cluster centers in consecutive tasks, and a feature embedding library that embeds feature relations shared among correlated tasks. When a new clustering task is coming, the knowledge is iteratively transferred from libraries to encode the new task, and knowledge libraries are updated according to the online update formulation. Meanwhile, basis libraries of different views are further fused into a consensus library with adaptive weights. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms other competitive clustering methods on multi-view datasets by a large margin",

    "title": "A Novel Demand Response Model and Method for Peak Reduction in Smart Grids -- PowerTAC",
    "abstract": "One of the widely used peak reduction methods in smart grids is demand response, where one analyzes the shift in customers' (agents') usage patterns in response to the signal from the distribution company. Often, these signals are in the form of incentives offered to agents. This work studies the effect of incentives on the probabilities of accepting such offers in a real-world smart grid simulator, PowerTAC. We first show that there exists a function that depicts the probability of an agent reducing its load as a function of the discounts offered to them. We call it reduction probability (RP). RP  function is further parametrized by the rate of reduction (RR), which can differ for each agent. We provide an optimal algorithm, MJS--ExpResponse, that outputs the discounts to each agent by maximizing the expected reduction under a budget constraint. When RRs are unknown, we propose a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) based online algorithm, namely MJSUCB--ExpResponse, to learn RRs. Experimentally we show that it exhibits sublinear regret. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in mitigating demand peaks in a real-world smart grid system using the PowerTAC simulator as a test bed",

    "abstract": "Few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) has become a great challenge, which requires classifying known classes and rejecting the unknown ones with only limited samples. Existing FSOSR methods mainly construct an ambiguous distribution of known classes from scarce known samples without considering the latent distribution information of unknowns, which degrades the performance of open-set recognition. To address this issue, we propose a novel loss function called multi-relation margin (MRM) loss that can plug in few-shot methods to boost the performance of FSOSR. MRM enlarges the margin between different classes by extracting the multi-relationship of paired samples to dynamically refine the decision boundary for known classes and implicitly delineate the distribution of unknowns. Specifically, MRM separates the classes by enforcing a margin while concentrating samples of the same class on a hypersphere with a learnable radius. In order to better capture the distribution information of each class, MRM extracts the similarity and correlations among paired samples, ameliorating the optimization of the margin and radius. Experiments on public benchmarks reveal that methods with MRM loss can improve the unknown detection of AUROC by a significant margin while correctly classifying the known classes",

    "abstract": "Actor-critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have recently achieved prominent success in tackling various challenging reinforcement learning (RL) problems, particularly complex control tasks with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. Nevertheless, existing research showed that actor-critic DRL algorithms often failed to explore their learning environments effectively, resulting in limited learning stability and performance. To address this limitation, several ensemble DRL algorithms have been proposed lately to boost exploration and stabilize the learning process. However, most of existing ensemble algorithms do not explicitly train all base learners towards jointly optimizing the performance of the ensemble. In this paper, we propose a new technique to train an ensemble of base learners based on an innovative multi-step integration method. This training technique enables us to develop a new hierarchical learning algorithm for ensemble DRL that effectively promotes inter-learner collaboration through stable inter-learner parameter sharing. The design of our new algorithm is verified theoretically. The algorithm is also shown empirically to outperform several state-of-the-art DRL algorithms on multiple benchmark RL problems",

In this paper, we take the latest statistical learning framework optimal margin distribution machine (ODM) which involves a quadratic-type loss due to the optimization of margin variance, for example, and equip it with the ability to handle IDL tasks. Our proposed ID-ODM can avoid updating the Lagrange multipliers in an infinite range by determining their optimal values beforehand so as to enjoy much more efficiency. Moreover, ID-ODM is also applicable when multiple instances come and leave simultaneously.

    "abstract": "Large-scale neural networks possess considerable expressive power. They are well-suited for complex learning tasks in industrial applications. However, large-scale models pose significant challenges for training under the current Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Existing approaches for efficient FL training often leverage model parameter dropout. However, manipulating individual model parameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication overhead when training  large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to the scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout (FedOBD) approach. The key novelty is that it decomposes large-scale models into semantic blocks so that FL participants can opportunistically upload quantized blocks, which are deemed to be significant towards training the model, to the FL server for aggregation. Extensive experiments evaluating FedOBD against four state-of-the-art approaches based on multiple real-world datasets show that it reduces the overall communication overhead by more than 88% compared to the best performing baseline approach, while achieving the highest test accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, FedOBD is the first approach to perform dropout on FL models at the block level rather than at the individual parameter level",

Motivated by it, we propose to use the local similarity (LocalSim) to learn node-level weighted fusion, which can also serve as a plug-and-play module. For better fusion, we propose a novel and efficient Initial Residual Difference Connection (IRDC) to extract more informative multi-hop information. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on the effectiveness of LocalSim representing node homophily on synthetic graphs. Extensive evaluations over real benchmark datasets show that our proposed method, namely Local Similarity Graph Neural Network (LSGNN), can offer comparable or superior state-of-the-art performance on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

While some existing methods are able to recover the latent hierarchical causal structure, they mostly suffer from restricted assumptions, including the tree-structured graph constraint, no ``triangle\" structure, and non-Gaussian assumptions.  In this paper, we relax these restrictions above and consider a more general and challenging scenario where the beyond tree-structured graph, the ``triangle\" structure, and the arbitrary noise distribution are allowed. We investigate the identifiability of the latent hierarchical causal structure and show that by using second-order statistics, the latent hierarchical structure can be identified up to the Markov equivalence classes over latent variables. Moreover, some directions in the Markov equivalence classes of latent variables can be further identified using partially non-Gaussian data. Based on the theoretical results above, we design an effective algorithm for learning the latent hierarchical causal structure.

    "title": "Deep Multi-view Subspace Clustering with Anchor Graph",
    "abstract": "Deep multi-view subspace clustering (DMVSC) has recently attracted increasing attention due to its promising performance. However, existing DMVSC methods still have two issues: (1) they mainly focus on using autoencoders to nonlinearly embed the data, while the embedding may be suboptimal for clustering because the clustering objective is rarely considered in autoencoders, and (2) existing methods typically have a quadratic or even cubic complexity, which makes it challenging to deal with large-scale data. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace clustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly learns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to obtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we construct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral clustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels. To overcome the negative impact caused by suboptimal embedded features, we use pseudo-labels to refine the embedding process to make it more suitable for the clustering task. Pseudo-labels and embedded features are updated alternately. Furthermore, we design a strategy to keep the consistency of the labels based on contrastive learning to enhance the clustering performance. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior clustering performance over other state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "One of the ultimate goals of Artificial Intelligence is to assist humans in complex decision making. A promising direction for achieving this goal is Neuro-Symbolic AI, which aims to combine the interpretability of symbolic techniques with the ability of deep learning to learn from raw data. However, most current approaches require manually engineered symbolic knowledge, and where end-to-end training is considered, such approaches are either restricted to learning definite programs, or are restricted to training binary neural networks. In this paper, we introduce Neuro-Symbolic Inductive Learner (NSIL), an approach that trains a general neural network to extract latent concepts from raw data, whilst learning symbolic knowledge that maps latent concepts to target labels. The novelty of our approach is a method for biasing the learning of symbolic knowledge, based on the in-training performance of both neural and symbolic components. We evaluate NSIL on three problem domains of different complexity, including an NP-complete problem.

DSL simultaneously learns the perception and symbolic functions while being trained only on their composition (NeSy-function).

Arguably, the reliance on myopic heuristic functions contributes to this limitation. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic class expression learning model, DRILL, to mitigate this limitation. By learning non-myopic heuristic functions with deep Q-learning, DRILL efficiently steers the standard search procedure in a quasi-ordered search space towards goal states. Our extensive experiments on 4 benchmark datasets and 390 learning problems suggest that DRILL converges to goal states at least 2.7 times faster than state-of-the-art models on all learning problems.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based methods have proven to be effective in achieving long-distance modeling, capturing the spatial and spectral information, and exhibiting strong inductive bias in various computer vision tasks. Generally, the Transformer model includes two common modes of multi-head self-attention (MSA): spatial MSA (Spa-MSA) and spectral MSA (Spe-MSA). However, Spa-MSA is computationally efficient but limits the global spatial response within a local window. On the other hand, Spe-MSA can calculate channel self-attention to accommodate high-resolution images, but it disregards the crucial local information that is essential for low-level vision tasks. In this study, we propose a bidirectional dilation Transformer (BDT) for multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF), which aims to leverage the advantages of both MSA and the latent multiscale information specific to MHIF tasks. The BDT consists of two designed modules: the dilation Spa-MSA (D-Spa), which dynamically expands the spatial receptive field through a given hollow strategy, and the grouped Spe-MSA (G-Spe), which extracts latent features within the feature map and learns local data behavior. Additionally, to fully exploit the multiscale information from both inputs with different spatial resolutions, we employ a bidirectional hierarchy strategy in the BDT, resulting in improved performance. Finally, extensive experiments on two commonly used datasets, CAVE and Harvard, demonstrate the superiority of BDT both visually and quantitatively.

It allows a direct analysis for stochastic gradient / Langevin descent (SGD/SGLD) learning algorithms without strong assumptions such as Lipschitz or convexity conditions. However, the current generalization error bounds within this framework are still far from optimal, while substantial improvements on these bounds are quite challenging due to the intractability of high-dimensional information quantities. To address this issue,  we first propose a novel information theoretical measure: kernelized Rényi's entropy, by utilizing operator representation in Hilbert space. It inherits the properties of Shannon's entropy and can be effectively calculated via simple random sampling, while remaining independent of the input dimension. We then establish the generalization error bounds for SGD/SGLD under kernelized Rényi's entropy, where the mutual information quantities can be directly calculated, enabling evaluation of the tightness of each intermediate step. We show that our information-theoretical bounds depend on the statistics of the stochastic gradients evaluated along with the iterates, and are rigorously tighter than the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

    "abstract": "Recent work on deep clustering has found new promising methods also for constrained clustering problems. \r\nTheir typically pairwise constraints often can be used to guide the partitioning of the data.\r\nMany problems however, feature cluster-level constraints, e.g. the Capacitated Clustering Problem (CCP), where each point has a weight and the total weight sum of all points in each cluster is bounded by a prescribed capacity. \r\nIn this paper we propose a new method for the CCP, Neural Capacited Clustering, that learns a neural network to predict the assignment probabilities of points to cluster centers from a data set of optimal or near optimal past solutions of other problem instances. \r\nDuring inference, the resulting scores are then used in an iterative k-means like procedure to refine the assignment under capacity constraints. \r\nIn our experiments on artificial data and two real world datasets our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art mathematical and heuristic solvers from the literature. \r\nMoreover, we apply our method in the context of a cluster-first-route-second approach to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and show competitive results on the well-known Uchoa benchmark",

    "title": "FedHGN: A Federated Framework for Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can learn from typed and relational graph data more effectively than conventional GNNs. With larger parameter spaces, HGNNs may require more training data, which is often scarce in real-world applications due to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multiple clients to train a GNN collaboratively without sharing their local data. However, existing FGL methods mainly focus on homogeneous GNNs or knowledge graph embeddings; few have considered heterogeneous graphs and HGNNs. In federated heterogeneous graph learning, clients may have private graph schemas. Conventional FL/FGL methods attempting to define a global HGNN model would violate schema privacy. To address these challenges, we propose FedHGN, a novel and general FGL framework for HGNNs. FedHGN adopts schema-weight decoupling to enable schema-agnostic knowledge sharing and employs coefficients alignment to stabilize the training process and improve HGNN performance. With better privacy preservation, FedHGN consistently outperforms local training and conventional FL methods on three widely adopted heterogeneous graph datasets with varying client numbers.

    "title": "Self-Recover: Forecasting Block Maxima in Time Series from Predictors with Disparate Temporal Coverage Using Self-Supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Forecasting the block maxima of a future time window is a challenging task due to the difficulty in inferring the tail distribution of a target variable. As the historical observations alone may not be sufficient to train robust models to predict the block maxima, domain-driven process models are often available in many scientific domains to supplement the observation data and improve the forecast accuracy. Unfortunately, coupling the historical observations with process model outputs is a challenge due to their disparate temporal coverage. This paper presents Self-Recover, a deep learning framework to predict the block maxima of a time window by employing self-supervised learning to address the varying temporal data coverage problem. Specifically Self-Recover uses a combination of contrastive and generative self-supervised learning schemes along with a denoising autoencoder to impute the missing values. The framework also combines representations of the historical observations with process model outputs via a residual learning approach and learns the generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution characterizing the block maxima values. This enables the framework to reliably estimate the block maxima of each time window along with its confidence interval. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Self-Recover compared to other state-of-the-art forecasting methods",

    "title": "Unbiased Risk Estimator to Multi-Labeled Complementary Label Learning",
    "abstract": "Multi-label learning (MLL) usually requires assigning multiple relevant labels to each instance. While a fully supervised MLL dataset needs a large amount of labeling effort, using complementary labels can help alleviate this burden. However, current approaches to learning from complementary labels are mainly designed for multi-class learning and assume that each instance has a single relevant label. This means that these approaches cannot be easily applied to MLL when only complementary labels are provided, where the number of relevant labels is unknown and can vary across instances. In this paper, we first propose the unbiased risk estimator for the multi-labeled complementary label learning (MLCLL) problem. We also provide an estimation error bound to ensure the convergence of the empirical risk estimator. In some cases, the unbiased estimator may give unbounded gradients for certain loss functions and result in overfitting. To mitigate this problem, we improve the risk estimator by minimizing a proper loss function, which has been shown to improve gradient updates.

    "title": "Modeling with Homophily Driven Heterogeneous Data in Gossip Learning",
    "abstract": "Training deep learning models on data distributed and local to edge devices such as mobile phones is a prominent recent research direction. In a Gossip Learning (GL) system, each participating device maintains a model trained on its local data and iteratively aggregates it with the models from its neighbours in a communication network. While the fully distributed operation in GL comes with natural advantages over the centralized orchestration in Federated Learning (FL), its convergence becomes particularly slow when the data distribution is heterogeneous and aligns with the clustered structure of the communication network. These characteristics are pervasive across practical applications as people with similar interests (thus producing similar data) tend to create communities.\r\n\r\nThis paper proposes a data-driven neighbor weighting strategy for aggregating the models: this enables faster diffusion of knowledge across the communities in the network and leads to quicker convergence. We augment the method to make it computationally efficient and fair: the devices quickly converge to the same model. We evaluate our model on real and synthetic datasets that we generate using a novel generative model for communication networks with heterogeneous data. Our exhaustive empirical evaluation  verifies that our proposed method attains a faster convergence rate than the baselines. For example, the median test accuracy for a decentralized bird image classifier application reaches 81% with our proposed method within 80 rounds, whereas the baseline only reaches 46%",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been applied successfully in many machine learning tasks due to their advantages in utilizing neighboring information. Recently, with the global enactment of privacy protection regulations, federated GNNs have gained increasing attention in academia and industry. However, the graphs owned by different participants could be non-independently-and-identically distributed (non-IID), leading to the deterioration of federated GNNs' accuracy. In this paper, we propose a globally consistent federated graph autoencoder (GCFGAE) to overcome the non-IID problem in unsupervised federated graph learning via three innovations. First, by integrating federated learning with split learning, we train a unique global model instead of FedAvg-styled global and local models, yielding results consistent with that of the centralized GAE. Second, we design a collaborative computation mechanism considering overlapping vertices to reduce communication overhead during forward propagation. Third, we develop a layer-wise and block-wise gradient computation strategy to reduce the space and communication complexity during backward propagation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that GCFGAE achieves not only higher accuracy but also around 500 times lower communication overhead and 1000 times smaller space overhead than existing federated GNN models",

    "abstract": "We investigate the generalization properties of a self-training algorithm with halfspaces. The approach learns a list of halfspaces iteratively from labeled and unlabeled training data, in which each iteration consists of two steps: exploration and pruning. In the exploration phase, the halfspace is found sequentially by maximizing the unsigned-margin among  unlabeled examples and then assigning pseudo-labels to those that have a distance higher than the current threshold. These pseudo-labels are allegedly corrupted by noise. The training set is then augmented with noisy pseudo-labeled examples, and a new classifier is trained.  This process is repeated until no more unlabeled examples remain for pseudo-labeling. In the pruning phase, pseudo-labeled samples that have a distance to the last halfspace greater than the associated  unsigned-margin are then discarded. We prove that the misclassification error of the resulting sequence of classifiers is bounded and show that the resulting semi-supervised approach never degrades performance compared to the  classifier learned using only the initial labeled training set.

BRExIt aims to (1) improve feature shaping in the apprentice, with a policy head predicting opponent policies as an auxiliary task, and (2) bias opponent moves in planning towards the given or learnt opponent model, to generate apprentice targets that better approximate a best response.

    "abstract": "Human activity recognition (HAR) is a fundamental sensing and analysis technique that supports diverse applications, such as smart homes and healthcare. In device-free and non-intrusive HAR, WiFi channel state information (CSI) captures wireless signal variations caused by human interference without the need for video cameras or on-body sensors. However, current CSI-based HAR performance is hampered by incomplete CSI recordings due to fixed window sizes in CSI collection and human/machine errors that incur missing values in CSI. To address these issues, we propose DiffAR, a temporal-augmented HAR approach that improves HAR performance by augmenting CSI. DiffAR devises a novel Adaptive Conditional Diffusion Model (ACDM) to synthesize augmented CSI, which tackles the issue of fixed windows by forecasting and handles missing values with imputation. Compared to existing diffusion models, ACDM improves the synthesis quality by guiding progressive synthesis with step-specific conditions. DiffAR further exploits an ensemble classifier for activity recognition using both raw and augmented CSI. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffAR achieves the best synthesis quality of augmented CSI and outperforms state-of-the-art CSI-based HAR methods in recognition performance.

First, for node-level semantic, we find that contrasting nodes from distinct classes is beneficial to provide a well-performing discrimination. We pull the local node towards the global node of the same class and push them away from the global node of different classes. Second, we postulate that a well-structural graph neural network possesses similarity for neighbors due to the inherent adjacency relationships. However, aligning each node with adjacent nodes hinders discrimination due to the potential class inconsistency. We transform the adjacency relationships into the similarity distribution and leverage the global model to distill the relation knowledge into the local model, which preserves the structural information and discriminability of the local model.

Recent years have witnessed the success of large-scale knowledge graphs, which could be ideal domain knowledge resources for real-world machine learning tasks. However, these large-scale knowledge graphs usually contain much information that is irrelevant to a specific learning task. Moreover, they often contain a certain degree of noise. Existing methods can hardly make use of them because the large-scale probabilistic logical inference is usually intractable. To address these problems, we present ABductive Learning with Knowledge Graph (ABL-KG) that can automatically mine logic rules from knowledge graphs during learning, using a knowledge forgetting mechanism for filtering out irrelevant information. Meanwhile, these rules can form a logic program that enables efficient joint optimization of the machine learning model and logic inference within the Abductive Learning (ABL) framework.

However, it is a non-trivial problem that extends them to multi-view time series data because of two main challenges: (i) the complex data structure, such as temporal dependency, can result in violation of the independent assumption; (ii) the factors from different views are generally overlapped and are hard to be aggregated to a complete set. In this work, we propose a novel framework MuLTI that employs the contrastive learning technique to invert the data generative process for enhanced identifiability. Additionally, MuLTI integrates a permutation mechanism that merges corresponding overlapped variables by the establishment of an optimal transport formula.

    "abstract": "This paper targets the perceptual task of separating the different interacting voices, i.e., monophonic melodic streams, in a polyphonic musical piece. We target symbolic music, where notes are explicitly encoded, and model this task as a Multi-Trajectory Tracking (MTT) problem from discrete observations, i.e., notes in a pitch-time space. Our approach builds a graph from a musical piece, by creating one node for every note, and separates the melodic trajectories by predicting a link between two notes if they are consecutive in the same voice/stream. This kind of local, greedy prediction is made possible by node embeddings created by a heterogeneous graph neural network that can capture inter- and intra-trajectory information. Furthermore, we propose a new regularization loss that encourages the output to respect the MTT premise of at most one incoming and one outgoing link for every node, favoring monophonic (voice) trajectories; this loss function might also be useful in other general MTT scenarios. Our approach does not use domain-specific heuristics, is scalable to longer sequences and a higher number of voices, and can handle complex cases such as voice inversions and overlaps.

Therefore, agents should be able to recognize whether they are in OOD states and learn how to return to the learned state distribution rather than continue to take unreliable actions. In this study, we propose a novel method for retraining agents to recover from OOD situations in a self-supervised manner when they fall into OOD states. Our in-depth experimental results demonstrate that our method substantially improves the agent’s ability to recover from OOD situations in terms of sample efficiency and restoration of the performance for the original tasks. Moreover, we show that our method can retrain the agent to recover from OOD situations even when in-distribution states are difficult to visit through exploration.

    "title": "MultiPar-T: Multiparty-Transformer for Capturing Contingent Behaviors in Group Conversations",
    "abstract": "As we move closer to real-world social AI systems, AI agents must be able to deal with multiparty (group) conversations. Recognizing and interpreting multiparty behaviors is challenging, as the system must recognize individual behavioral cues, deal with the complexity of multiple streams of data from multiple people, and recognize the subtle contingent social exchanges that take place amongst group members. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Multiparty-Transformer (Multipar- T), a transformer model for multiparty behavior modeling. The core component of our proposed approach is Crossperson Attention, which is specifically designed to detect contingent behavior between pairs of people. We verify the effectiveness of Multipar-T on a publicly available video-based group engagement detection benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in average F-1 scores by 5.2% and individual class F-1 scores by up to 10.0%. Through qualitative analysis, we show that our Crossperson Attention module is able to discover contingent behaviors",

    "title": "Stochastic Feature Averaging for Learning with Long-Tailed Noisy Labels",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown promising results on a wide variety of tasks using large-scale and well-annotated training datasets. However, data collected from real-world applications can suffer from two prevalent biases, i.e., long-tailed class distribution and label noise. Previous efforts on long-tailed learning and label-noise learning can only address a single type of data bias, leading to a severe deterioration of their performance. In this paper, we propose a distance-based sample selection algorithm called Stochastic Feature Averaging (SFA), which fits a Gaussian using the exponential running average of class centroids to capture uncertainty in representation space due to label noise and data scarcity. With SFA, we detect noisy samples based on their distances to class centroids sampled from this Gaussian distribution. Based on the identified clean samples, we then propose to train an auxiliary balanced classifier to improve the generalization for the minority class and facilitate the update of Gaussian parameters. Extensive experimental results show that SFA can enhance the performance of existing methods on both simulated and real-world datasets. Further, we propose to combine SFA with the sample-selection approach, distribution-robust, and noise-robust loss functions, resulting in significant improvement in performance over the baselines.

Namely, i) instance commonality refers to that within-cluster instances should share a common pattern, and ii) view versatility refers to that cross-view samples should own view-specific patterns. To this end, we design a novel dual-stream model which employs a dual attention layer and a dual contrastive learning loss to learn view-specific prototypes and model the sample-prototype relationship. When the view is missed, our model performs data recovery using the prototypes in the missing view and the sample-prototype relationship inherited from the observed view. Thanks to our dual-stream model, both cluster- and view-specific information could be captured, and thus the instance commonality and view versatility could be preserved to facilitate IMvC.

    "abstract": "Despite its success, generative adversarial networks (GANs) still suffer from mode collapse, i.e., the generator can only map latent variables to a partial set of modes in the target distribution. In this paper, we analyze and seek to regularize this issue with an independent and identically distributed (IID) sampling perspective and emphasize that holding the IID property referring to the target distribution for generation can naturally avoid mode collapse. This is based on the basic IID assumption for real data in machine learning. However, though the source samples {z} obey IID, the generations {G(z)} may not necessarily be IID sampling from the target distribution. Based on this observation, considering a necessary condition of IID generation, we propose a new loss to encourage the closeness between the inverse samples of real data and the Gaussian source in the latent space to regularize the generation to be IID from the target distribution. The logic is that the inverse samples from target data should also be IID in the source distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of our model",

    "abstract": "Sleep stage classification is of great significance to the diagnosis of sleep disorders. However, existing sleep stage classification models based on deep learning are usually relatively large in size (wider and deeper), which makes them hard to be deployed on wearable devices. Therefore, it is a challenge to lighten the existing sleep stage classification models. In this paper, we propose a novel general knowledge distillation framework for sleep stage classification tasks called SleepKD. Our SleepKD, composed of the multi-level module, teacher assistant module, and other knowledge distillation modules, aims to lighten large-scale sleep stage classification models. Specifically, the multi-level module is able to transfer the multi-level knowledge extracted from sleep signals by the teacher model (large-scale model) to the student model (lightweight model). Moreover, the teacher assistant module bridges the large gap between the teacher and student network, and further improves the distillation. We evaluate our method on two public sleep datasets (Sleep-EDF and ISRUC-III). Compared to the baseline methods, the results show that our knowledge distillation framework achieves state-of-the-art performance. SleepKD can significantly lighten the sleep model while maintaining its classification performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/HychaoWang/SleepKD",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) collaboratively models user data in a decentralized way. However, in the real world, non-identical and independent data distributions (non-IID) among clients hinder the performance of FL due to three issues, i.e., (1) the class statistics shifting, (2) the insufficient hierarchical information utilization, and (3) the inconsistency in aggregating clients. To address the above issues, we propose HyperFed which contains three main modules, i.e., hyperbolic prototype Tammes initialization (HPTI), hyperbolic prototype learning (HPL), and consistent aggregation (CA). Firstly, HPTI in the server constructs uniformly distributed and fixed class prototypes, and shares them with clients to match class statistics, further guiding consistent feature representation for local clients. Secondly, HPL in each client captures the hierarchical information in local data with the supervision of shared class prototypes in the hyperbolic model space. Additionally, CA in the server mitigates the impact of the inconsistent deviations from clients to server. Extensive studies of four datasets prove that HyperFed is effective in enhancing the performance of FL under the non-IID setting",

The models were trained to interact with a simulated environment based on historical market data and learn trading strategies. However, using deep neural networks based on the returns of each period can be challenging due to the unpredictability of financial markets. As a result, the policies learned from training data may not be effective when tested in real-world situations. To address this issue, we incorporated contrastive learning and reward smoothing into our training process. Contrastive learning allows the RL models to recognize patterns in asset states that may indicate future price movements. Reward smoothing, on the other hand, serves as a regularization technique to prevent the models from seeking immediate but uncertain profits. We tested our method against various traditional financial techniques and other deep RL methods, and found it to be effective in both the U.S. stock market and the cryptocurrency market.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has been widely concerned for it enables decentralized learning while ensuring data privacy. However, most existing methods unrealistically assume that the classes encountered by local clients are fixed over time. After learning new classes, this impractical assumption will make the model's catastrophic forgetting of old classes significantly severe. Moreover, due to the limitation of communication cost, it is challenging to use large-scale models in FL, which will affect the prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Federated Enhanced Transformer (FedET), which simultaneously achieves high accuracy and low communication cost. Specifically, FedET uses Enhancer, a tiny module, to absorb and communicate new knowledge, and applies pre-trained Transformers combined with different Enhancers to ensure high precision on various tasks. To address local forgetting caused by new classes of new tasks and global forgetting brought by non-i.i.d class imbalance across different local clients, we proposed an Enhancer distillation method to modify the imbalance between old and new knowledge and repair the non-i.i.d. problem. Experimental results demonstrate that FedET's average accuracy on a representative benchmark dataset is 14.1% higher than the state-of-the-art method, while FedET saves 90% of the communication cost compared to the previous method",

    "abstract": "Different from conventional federated learning, personalized federated learning (PFL) is able to train a customized model for each individual client according to its unique requirement. The mainstream approach is to adopt a kind of weighted aggregation method to generate personalized models, in which weights are determined by the loss value or model parameters among different clients. However, such kinds of methods require clients to download others' models. It not only sheer increases communication traffic but also potentially infringes data privacy. In this paper, we propose a new PFL algorithm called FedDWA (Federated Learning with Dynamic Weight Adjustment) to address the above problem, which leverages the parameter server (PS) to compute personalized aggregation weights based on collected models from clients. In this way, FedDWA can capture similarities between clients with much less communication overhead. More specifically, we formulate the PFL problem as an optimization problem by minimizing the distance between personalized models and  guidance models, so as to  customize aggregation weights for each client. Guidance models are obtained by  the local one-step ahead adaptation on individual clients. Finally,  we conduct extensive experiments using five real datasets and the results demonstrate that FedDWA can significantly reduce the communication traffic and achieve much higher model accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches",

First, a bi-level contrastive learning method is introduced, which maintains the pair-wise similarity of the prototypes and the prototype group levels for better representation learning. Then, a reliable prototype similarity metric is proposed based on the common representing instances. Prototypes with high similarities will be grouped progressively for known class recognition and novel class discovery.

Tackling such problems requires a careful cost-benefit analysis of candidate locations and balancing exploration and exploitation.  In this work, we formulate such a problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solve it by proposing a new distance-adjusted multi-step look-ahead acquisition function, the distUCB, and using rollout approximation. We also provide a theoretical regret analysis of the distUCB-based Bayesian optimization algorithm.

In this paper, we establish the connection between the recognizability of representations and the recent functional conditional mutual information (f-CMI) generalization bound, which is significantly easier to estimate.

    "abstract": "Noisy labels seriously degrade the generalization ability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in various classification tasks. Existing studies on label-noise learning mainly focus on computer vision, while time series also suffer from the same issue. Directly applying the methods from computer vision to time series may reduce the temporal dependency due to different data characteristics. How to make use of the properties of time series to enable DNNs to learn robust representations in the presence of noisy labels has not been fully explored. To this end, this paper proposes a method that expands the distribution of Confident instances by Time-Warping (CTW) to learn robust representations of time series. Specifically, since applying the augmentation method to all data may introduce extra mislabeled data, we select confident instances to implement Time-Warping. In addition, we normalize the distribution of the training loss of each class to eliminate the model's selection preference for instances of different classes, alleviating the class imbalance caused by sample selection. Extensive experimental results show that CTW achieves state-of-the-art performance on the UCR datasets when dealing with different types of noise.

    "abstract": "In multi-label classification, it is critical to capitalize on complicated data structures and semantic relationships. Metric learning serves as an effective strategy to provide a better measurement of distances between examples. Existing works on metric learning for multi-label classification mainly learn one single global metric that characterizes latent semantic similarity between multi-label instances. However, such single-semantics metric exploitation approaches can not capture the intrinsic properties of multi-label data possessed of rich semantics. In this paper, the first attempt towards multi-semantics metric learning for multi-label classification is investigated. Specifically, the proposed LIMIC approach simultaneously learns one global and multiple label-specific local metrics by exploiting label-specific side information. The global metric is learned to capture the commonality across all the labels and label-specific local metrics characterize the individuality of each semantic space. The combination of global metric and label-specific local metrics is utilized to construct latent semantic space for each label, in which similar intra-class instances are pushed closer and inter-class instances are pulled apart. Furthermore, metric-based label correlation regularization is constructed to maintain similarity between correlated label spaces.

Recently, researchers have achieved non-autoregressive reaction prediction by modeling the redistribution of electrons, resulting in state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy, and enabling parallel sampling. However, the current non-autoregressive decoder does not satisfy two essential rules of electron redistribution modeling simultaneously: the electron-counting rule and the symmetry rule. This violation of the physical constraints of chemical reactions impairs model performance. In this work, we propose a new framework called ReactionSink that combines two doubly stochastic self-attention mappings to obtain electron redistribution predictions that follow both constraints. We further extend our solution to a general multi-head attention mechanism with augmented constraints. To achieve this, we apply Sinkhorn's algorithm to iteratively update self-attention mappings, which imposes doubly conservative constraints as additional informative priors on electron redistribution modeling. We theoretically demonstrate that our ReactionSink can simultaneously satisfy both rules, which the current decoder mechanism cannot do. Empirical results show that our approach consistently improves the predictive performance of non-autoregressive models and does not bring an unbearable additional computational cost",

Our work exploits this relationship to provide a theory for what constitutes an adversarial dataset under a given reconstruction loss. We verify this by constructing an example dataset that prevents disentanglement in state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining human-intuitive ground-truth factors. Finally, we re-enable disentanglement by designing an example reconstruction loss that is once again able to perceive the ground-truth factors.

The intrinsic motivation for artificial agents is modelled on the concept of human social motivation that entices humans to meet and understand each other, especially when experiencing a utility loss. Our intrinsic motivation encourages agents to stay near each other to obtain better observations and construct a model of others. They do so when their model of other agents is poor, or the overall task performance is bad during the learning phase. This simple but effective method facilitates the processes of modelling others, resulting in an improvement of the performance in cooperative tasks significantly. Our experiments demonstrate that the socially-motivated agent can model others better and promote cooperation across different tasks",

    "title": "Efficient NLP Model Finetuning via Multistage Data Filtering",
    "abstract": "As model finetuning is central to the modern NLP, we set to maximize its efficiency. Motivated by redundancy in training examples and the sheer sizes of pretrained models, we exploit a key opportunity: training only on important data. To this end, we set to filter training examples in a streaming fashion, in tandem with training the target model. Our key techniques are two: (1) automatically determine a training loss threshold for skipping backward training passes; (2) run a meta predictor for further skipping forward training passes. We integrate the above techniques in a holistic, three-stage training pro- cess. On a diverse set of benchmarks, our method reduces the required training examples by up to 5.3× and training time by up to 6.8×, while only seeing minor accuracy degradation. Our method is effective even for training one epoch, where each training example is encountered only once. It is simple to implement and is compatible with the existing finetuning techniques.

    "title": "Mitigating Disparity while Maximizing Reward: Tight Anytime Guarantee for Improving Bandits",
    "abstract": "We study the Improving Multi-Armed Bandit problem, where the reward obtained from an arm increases with the number of pulls it receives. This model provides an elegant abstraction for many real-world problems in domains such as education and employment, where decisions about the distribution of opportunities can affect the future capabilities of communities and the disparity between them. A decision-maker in such settings must consider the impact of her decisions on future rewards in addition to the standard objective of maximizing her cumulative reward at any time. We study the tension between two seemingly conflicting objectives in the horizon-unaware setting: a) maximizing the cumulative reward at any time and b) ensuring that arms with better long-term rewards get sufficient pulls even if they initially have low rewards. We show that, surprisingly, the two objectives are aligned with each other. Our main contribution is an anytime algorithm for the IMAB problem that achieves the best possible cumulative reward while ensuring that the arms reach their true potential given sufficient time. Our algorithm mitigates the initial disparity due to lack of opportunity and continues pulling an arm until it stops improving. We prove the optimality of our algorithm by showing that a) any algorithm for the IMAB problem, no matter how utilitarian, must suffer Omega(T) policy regret and Omega(k) competitive ratio with respect to the optimal offline policy, and b) the competitive ratio of our algorithm is O(k)",

    "abstract": "Generalization beyond in-domain experience to out-of-distribution data is of paramount significance in the AI domain. Of late, state-of-the-art Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have shown impressive performance on in-domain data, partially due to the language prior bias which, however, hinders the generalization ability in practice. This paper attempts to provide new insights into the influence of language modality on VQA performance from an empirical study perspective. To achieve this, we conducted a series of experiments on six models. The results of these experiments revealed that, 1) apart from prior bias caused by question types, there is a notable influence of postfix-related bias in inducing biases, and 2) training VQA models with word-sequence-related variant questions demonstrated improved performance on the out-of-distribution benchmark, and the LXMERT even achieved a 10-point gain without adopting any debiasing methods. We delved into the underlying reasons behind these experimental results and put forward some simple proposals to reduce the models' dependency on language priors. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method in improving performance on the out-of-distribution benchmark, VQA-CPv2.  We hope this study can inspire novel insights for future research on designing bias-reduction approaches",

    "abstract": "Source-Free domain adaptation transits the source-trained model towards target domain without exposing the source data, trying to dispel these concerns about data privacy and security. However, this paradigm is still at risk of data leakage due to adversarial attacks on the source model. Hence, the Black-Box setting only allows to use the outputs of source model, but still suffers from overfitting on the source domain more severely due to source model's unseen weights. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named RAIN (RegulArization on Input and Network) for Black-Box domain adaptation from both input-level and network-level regularization. For the input-level, we design a new data augmentation technique as Phase MixUp, which highlights task-relevant objects in the interpolations, thus enhancing input-level regularization and class consistency for target models. For network-level, we develop a Subnetwork Distillation mechanism to transfer knowledge from the target subnetwork to the full target network via knowledge distillation, which thus alleviates overfitting on the source domain by learning diverse target representations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on several cross-domain benchmarks under both single- and multi-source black-box domain adaptation",

    "abstract": "This work, for the first time, introduces two constant factor approximation algorithms with linear query complexity for non-monotone submodular maximization over a ground set of size n subject to a knapsack constraint, DLA  and RLA. DLA is a deterministic algorithm that provides an approximation factor of nearly 6 while  RLA  is a randomized algorithm with an approximation factor of nearly 4. Both run in linear query complexity. The key idea to obtain a constant approximation ratio with linear query lies in: (1) dividing the ground set into two appropriate subsets to find the near-optimal solution over these subsets with linear queries, and (2) combining a threshold greedy with properties of two disjoint sets or a random selection process to improve solution quality. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed solutions with three applications: Revenue Maximization, Image Summarization, and Maximum Weighted Cut, showing that our algorithms not only return comparative results to state-of-the-art algorithms but also require significantly fewer queries",

Existing FL methods usually uniformly sample clients for local model learning in each round. However, different clients may have significantly different data sizes, and the clients with more data cannot have more opportunities to contribute to model training, which may lead to inferior performance. In this paper, instead of client uniform sampling, we propose a novel data uniform sampling strategy for federated learning (FedSampling), which can effectively improve the performance of federated learning especially when client data size distribution is highly imbalanced across clients. In each federated learning round, local data on each client is randomly sampled for local model learning according to a probability based on the server desired sample size and the total sample size on all available clients. Since the data size on each client is privacy-sensitive, we propose a privacy-preserving way to estimate the total sample size with a differential privacy guarantee.

However, in many real world applications, both feature values and the labels are unknown a priori and can only be obtained at a cost. For example, in medical diagnosis, doctors have to choose which tests to perform (i.e., making costly feature queries) on a patient in order to make a diagnosis decision (i.e., predicting labels). We provide a fresh perspective to tackle this practical challenge. Our framework consists of an active planning oracle embedded in an online learning scheme for which we investigate several information acquisition functions. Specifically, we employ a surrogate information acquisition function based on adaptive submodularity to actively query feature values with a minimal cost, while using a posterior sampling scheme to maintain a low regret for online prediction. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our framework via extensive experiments on various real-world datasets.

Theoretical works have pointed towards Sum aggregation GNNs subsuming every other GNNs, while certain practical works have observed a clear advantage to using Mean and Max. An examination of the theoretical guarantee identifies two caveats. First, it is size-restricted, that is, the power of every specific GNN is limited to graphs of a specific size. Successfully processing larger graphs may require an other GNN, and so on. Second, it concerns the power to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs, not the power to approximate general functions on graphs, and the former does not necessarily imply the latter.\r\nIt is desired that a GNN's usability will not be limited to graphs of any specific size. Therefore, we explore the realm of unrestricted-size expressivity. We prove that basic functions, which can be computed exactly by Mean or Max GNNs, are inapproximable by any Sum GNN. We prove that under certain restrictions, every Mean or Max GNN can be approximated by a Sum GNN, but even there, a combination of (Sum, [Mean/Max]) is more expressive than Sum alone.

We propose a novel and more general product MDP, reward structure and discounting mechanism that, when applied in conjunction with off-the-shelf model-free RL algorithms, efficiently learn the optimal policy that maximizes the probability of satisfying a given LTL specification with optimality guarantees. We also provide improved theoretical results on choosing the key parameters in RL to ensure optimality. To directly evaluate the learned policy, we adopt probabilistic model checker PRISM to compute the probability of the policy satisfying such specifications.

    "title": "Unreliable Partial Label Learning with Recursive Separation",
    "abstract": "Partial label learning (PLL) is a typical weakly supervised learning problem in which each instance is associated with a candidate label set, and among which only one is true. However, the assumption that the ground-truth label is always among the candidate label set would be unrealistic, as the reliability of the candidate label sets in real-world applications cannot be guaranteed by annotators. Therefore, a generalized PLL named Unreliable Partial Label Learning (UPLL) is proposed, in which the true label may not be in the candidate label set. Due to the challenges posed by unreliable labeling, previous PLL methods will experience a marked decline in performance when applied to UPLL. To address the issue, we propose a two-stage framework named Unreliable Partial Label Learning with Recursive Separation (UPLLRS). In the first stage, the self-adaptive recursive separation strategy is proposed to separate the training set into a reliable subset and an unreliable subset. In the second stage, a disambiguation strategy is employed to progressively identify the ground-truth labels in the reliable subset. Simultaneously, semi-supervised learning methods are adopted to extract valuable information from the unreliable subset.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved considerable success in many fields, but applying it to real-world problems can be costly and risky because it requires a lot of online interaction. Recently, offline RL has shown the possibility of extracting a solution through existing logged data without online interaction. In this work, we propose an offline hierarchical RL method, Guider (Guide to Control), that can efficiently solve long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks from offline data. The high-level policy sequentially generates a subgoal that can guide the agent to arrive at the final goal, and the lower-level policy learns how to reach each given guided subgoal. In the process of learning from offline data, the key is to make the low-level policy reachable to the generated subgoals. We show that high-quality subgoal generation is possible through pre-training a latent subgoal prior model. The well-regulated subgoal generation improves performance while avoiding distributional shifts in offline RL by breaking down long, complex tasks into shorter, easier ones. For evaluations, Guider outperforms prior offline RL methods in long-horizon robot navigation and complex manipulation benchmarks. Our code is available at https://github.com/gckor/Guider",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches have utilized self-supervised auxiliary tasks as representation learning to improve the performance and sample efficiency of vision-based reinforcement learning algorithms in single-agent settings. However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), these techniques face challenges because each agent only receives partial observation from an environment influenced by others, resulting in correlated observations in the agent dimension. So it is necessary to consider agent-level information in representation learning for MARL. In this paper, we propose an effective framework called Multi-Agent Masked Attentive Contrastive Learning (MA2CL), which encourages learning representation to be both temporal and agent-level predictive by reconstructing the masked agent observation in latent space. Specifically, we use an attention reconstruction model for recovering and the model is trained via contrastive learning. MA2CL allows better utilization of contextual information at the agent level, facilitating the training of MARL agents for cooperation tasks.

A learnware comprises a trained model and the specification which enables the model to be adequately identified according to the user's requirement. Previous studies concentrated on the homogeneous case where models share the same feature space based on Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) specification. However, in real-world scenarios, models are typically constructed from different feature spaces. If such a scenario can be handled by the market, all models built for a particular task even with different feature spaces can be identified and reused for a new user task. Generally, this problem would be easier if there were additional auxiliary data connecting different feature spaces, however, obtaining such data in reality is challenging. In this paper, we present a general framework for accommodating heterogeneous learnwares without requiring additional auxiliary data. The key idea is to utilize the submitted RKME specifications to establish the relationship between different feature spaces. Additionally, we give a matrix factorization-based implementation and propose the overall procedure for constructing and exploiting the heterogeneous learnware market.

The mean square error (MSE) and cross-entropy (CE) losses are widely applied to supervise the training of SNNs on neuromorphic datasets. However, the relevance between the output spike counts and predictions is not well modeled by the existing loss functions. This paper proposes a Spike Count Maximization (SCM) training approach for the SNN-based neuromorphic vision recognition model based on optimizing the output spike counts. The SCM is achieved by structural risk minimization (SRM) and a specially designed spike counting loss. The spike counting loss counts the output spikes of the SNN by using the L0-norm, and the SRM maximizes the distance between the margin boundaries of the classifier to ensure the generalization of the model. The SCM is non-smooth and non-differentiable, and we design a two-stage algorithm with fast convergence to solve the problem. Experiment results demonstrate that the SCM performs satisfactorily in most cases. Using the output spikes for prediction, the accuracies of SCM are 2.12%~16.50% higher than the popular training losses on the CIFAR10-DVS dataset.

We then propose a novel regularization method, predecessor combination search (PCS), to improve calibration by searching a combination of best-fitting block predecessors, where block predecessors are the corresponding network blocks with weight parameters from earlier training stages. PCS achieves the state-of-the-art calibration performance on multiple datasets and architectures. In addition, PCS improves model robustness under dataset distribution shift.

    "title": "One Model, Any CSP: Graph Neural Networks as Fast Global Search Heuristics for Constraint Satisfaction",
    "abstract": "We propose a universal Graph Neural Network architecture which can be trained as an end-2-end search heuristic for any Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Our architecture can be trained unsupervised with policy gradient descent to generate problem specific heuristics for any CSP in a purely data driven manner. \r\nThe approach is based on a novel graph representation for CSPs that is both generic and compact and enables us to process every possible CSP instance with one GNN, regardless of constraint arity, relations or domain size. Unlike previous RL-based methods, we operate on a global search action space and allow our GNN to modify any number of variables in every step of the stochastic search. This enables our method to properly leverage the inherent parallelism of GNNs. \r\nWe perform a thorough empirical evaluation where we learn heuristics for well known and important CSPs, both decision and optimisation problems, from random data, including graph coloring, MAXCUT, and MAX-k-SAT, and the general RB model. Our approach significantly outperforms prior end-2-end approaches for neural combinatorial optimization. It can compete with conventional heuristics and solvers on test instances that are several orders of magnitude larger and structurally more complex than those seen during training",

    "abstract": "Exploration is a fundamental aspect of reinforcement learning (RL), and its effectiveness is a deciding factor in the performance of RL algorithms, especially when facing sparse extrinsic rewards. Recent studies have shown the effectiveness of encouraging exploration with intrinsic rewards estimated from novelties in observations. However, there is a gap between the novelty of an observation and an exploration, as both the stochasticity in the environment and the agent's behavior may affect the observation. To evaluate exploratory behaviors accurately, we propose DEIR, a novel method in which we theoretically derive an intrinsic reward with a conditional mutual information term that principally scales with the novelty contributed by agent explorations, and then implement the reward with a discriminative forward model. Extensive experiments on both standard and advanced exploration tasks in MiniGrid show that DEIR quickly learns a better policy than the baselines. Our evaluations on ProcGen demonstrate both the generalization capability and the general applicability of our intrinsic reward",

    "title": "DeLELSTM: Decomposition-based Linear Explainable LSTM to Capture Instantaneous and Long-term Effects in Time Series",
    "abstract": "Time series forecasting is prevalent in various real-world applications. Despite the promising results of deep learning models in time series forecasting, especially the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), the explanations of time series models, which are critical in high-stakes applications, have received little attention. In this paper, we propose a Decomposition-based Linear Explainable LSTM (DeLELSTM) to improve the interpretability of LSTM. Conventionally, the interpretability of RNNs only concentrates on the variable importance and time importance. We additionally distinguish between the instantaneous influence of new coming data and the long-term effects of historical data. Specifically, DeLELSTM consists of two components, i.e., standard LSTM and tensorized LSTM. The tensorized LSTM assigns each variable with a unique hidden state making up a matrix h(t), and the standard LSTM models all the variables with a shared hidden state H(t). By decomposing the H(t) into the linear combination of past information h(t-1) and the fresh information h(t)-h(t-1), we can get the instantaneous influence and the long-term effect of each feature. In addition, the advantage of linear regression also makes the explanation transparent and clear. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of DeLELSTM on three empirical datasets. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance against the baseline methods and provides a reliable explanation relative to domain knowledge",

    "title": "Deep Partial Multi-Label Learning with Graph Disambiguation",
    "abstract": "In partial multi-label learning (PML), each data example is equipped with a candidate label set, which consists of multiple ground-truth labels and other false-positive labels. Recently, graph-based methods, which demonstrate a good ability to estimate accurate confidence scores from candidate labels, have been prevalent to deal with PML problems. However, we observe that existing graph-based PML methods typically adopt linear multi-label classifiers and thus fail to achieve superior performance. In this work, we attempt to remove several obstacles for extending them to deep models and propose a novel deep Partial multi-Label model with grAph-disambIguatioN (PLAIN). Specifically, we introduce the instance-level and label-level similarities to recover label confidences as well as exploit label dependencies. At each training epoch, labels are propagated on the instance and label graphs to produce relatively accurate pseudo-labels; then, we train the deep model to fit the numerical labels. Moreover, we provide a careful analysis of the risk functions to guarantee the robustness of the proposed model. Extensive experiments on various synthetic datasets and three real-world PML datasets demonstrate that PLAIN achieves significantly superior results to state-of-the-art methods",

For a given case, the joint model first skims the full feature vector, decides which features are relevant for that case, and makes a classification decision using only the selected features, resulting in compact, interpretable, and case-specific classification decisions. Because the selected features depend on the case at hand, we refer to this approach as context-aware feature selection and classification. The model can be trained on instances that are annotated by experts with both class labels and instance-level feature selections, so it can select instance-level features that humans would use. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms eight baselines on a combined classification and feature selection measure, and is able to better emulate the ground-truth instance-level feature selections.

    "abstract": "With the development of Vision-Language Pre-training Models (VLPMs) represented by CLIP and ALIGN, significant breakthroughs have been achieved for association-based visual tasks such as image classification and image-text retrieval by the zero-shot capability of CLIP without fine-tuning. However, CLIP is hard to apply to generation-based tasks. This is due to the lack of decoder architecture and pre-training tasks for generation. Although previous works have created generation capacity for CLIP through additional language models, a modality gap between the CLIP representations of different modalities and the inability of CLIP to model the offset of this gap, which results in the failure of the concept to transfer across modes. To solve the problem, we try to map images/videos to the language modality and generate captions from the language modality. In this paper, we propose the K-nearest-neighbor Cross-modality Mapping (Knight), a zero-shot method from association to generation. With vision-free unsupervised training, Knight achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot methods for image captioning and video captioning",

    "abstract": "Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms, a subset of evolutionary algorithms, maintain an archive (i.e., a set of solutions) and simulate the natural evolution process through iterative selection and reproduction, with the goal of generating a set of high-quality and diverse solutions. Though having found many successful applications in reinforcement learning, QD algorithms often select the parent solutions uniformly at random, which lacks selection pressure and may limit the performance. Recent studies have treated each type of behavior of a solution as an objective, and selected the parent solutions based on Multi-objective Optimization (MO), which is a natural idea, but has not lead to satisfactory performance as expected. This paper gives the reason for the first time, and then proposes a new MO-based selection method by non-surrounded-dominated sorting (NSS), which considers all possible directions of the behaviors, and thus can generate diverse solutions over the whole behavior space. By combining NSS with the most widespread QD algorithm, MAP-Elites, we perform experiments on synthetic functions and several complex tasks (i.e., QDGym, robotic arm, and Mario environment generation), showing that NSS achieves better performance than not only other MO-based selection methods but also state-of-the-art selection methods in QD",

    "abstract": "This study proposes FEDBFPT (Federated BERT Further Pre-Training), a Federated Learning (FL) framework for further pre-training the BERT language model in specialized domains while addressing privacy concerns. FEDBFPT enables multiple clients to collaboratively train the shallower layers of BERT, which are crucial in the pre-training stage, without the need to share private data. To achieve this, FEDBFPT involves building a local model for each client, progressively training the shallower layers of local models while sampling deeper layers, and aggregating trained parameters on a server to create the final global model. This approach utilizes multiple smaller local models to further pre-train a global model targeted at specific tasks via fine-tuning, resulting in a reduction in resource usage while maintaining model accuracy. Theoretical analysis is conducted to support the efficiency of FEDBFPT, and experiments are conducted on corpora across domains such as medicine, biology, and computer science. Results indicate that FEDBFPT achieves performance levels comparable to traditional FL methods while reducing computation and communication costs by 46.70% and 7.04%, respectively, even approaching the performance of centralized training models.

    "abstract": "Label distribution learning (LDL) is a new machine learning paradigm for solving label ambiguity. Since it is difficult to directly obtain label distributions, many studies are focusing on how to recover label distributions from logical labels, dubbed label enhancement (LE). Existing LE methods estimate label distributions by simply building a mapping relationship between features and label distributions under the supervision of logical labels. They typically overlook the fact that both features and logical labels are descriptions of the instance from different views. Therefore, we propose a novel method called Contrastive Label Enhancement (ConLE) which integrates features and logical labels into the unified projection space to generate high-level features by contrastive learning strategy. In this approach, features and logical labels belonging to the same sample are pulled closer, while those of different samples are projected farther away from each other in the projection space. Subsequently, we leverage the obtained high-level features to gain label distributions through a well-designed training strategy that considers the consistency of label attributes.

In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer variant (Singularformer) that uses neural networks to learn the singular value decomposition process of the attention matrix to design a linear-complexity and memory-efficient global self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we decompose the attention matrix into the product of three matrix factors based on singular value decomposition and design neural networks to learn these matrix factors, then the associative law of matrix multiplication is used to linearize the calculation of self-attention. The above procedure allows us to compute self-attention as two-dimensional reduction processes in the first and second token dimensional spaces, followed by a multi-head self-attention computational process on the first dimensional reduced token features.

To overcome the potential side effect of excessive clean set selection procedure, we further devise a novel SSL framework that is able to train balanced and unbiased classifiers on the separated clean and noisy samples.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is a family of promising tools for graph semi-supervised learning. However, in training, most existing GNNs rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data, which is rare in real-world scenarios. Unlabeled data with useful information are usually under-exploited, which limits the representation power of GNNs. To handle these problems, we propose Virtual Overbridge Linking (Violin), a generic framework to enhance the learning capacity of common GNNs. By learning to add virtual overbridges between two nodes that are estimated to be semantic-consistent, labeled and unlabeled data can be correlated. Supervised information can be well utilized in training while simultaneously inducing the model to learn from unlabeled data. Discriminative relation patterns extracted from unlabeled nodes can also be shared with other nodes even if they are remote from each other. Motivated by recent advances in data augmentations, we additionally integrate Violin with the consistency regularized training. Such a scheme yields node representations with better robustness, which significantly enhances a GNN. Violin can be readily extended to a wide range of GNNs without introducing additional learnable parameters. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that our method is effective and robust under low-label rate scenarios, where Violin can boost some GNNs' performance by over 10% on node classifications",

    "abstract": "For many real-world time series tasks, the computational complexity of prevalent deep leaning models often hinders the deployment on resource limited environments (e.g., smartphones). Moreover, due to the inevitable domain shift between model training (source) and deploying (target) stages, compressing those deep models under cross-domain scenarios becomes more challenging. Although some of existing works have already explored cross-domain knowledge distillation for model compression, they are either biased to source data or heavily tangled between source and target data. To this end, we design a novel end-to-end framework called UNiversal and joInt Knowledge Distillation (UNI-KD) for cross-domain model compression. In particular, we propose to transfer both the universal feature-level knowledge across source and target domains and the joint logit-level knowledge shared by both domains from the teacher to the student model via an adversarial learning scheme. More specifically, a feature-domain discriminator is employed to align teacher’s and student’s representations for universal knowledge transfer. A data-domain discriminator is utilized to prioritize the domain-shared samples for joint knowledge transfer.

    "title": "Expanding the Hyperbolic Kernels: A Curvature-aware Isometric Embedding View",
    "abstract": "Modeling data relation as a hierarchical structure has proven beneficial for many learning scenarios, and the hyperbolic space, with negative curvature, can encode such data hierarchy without distortion. Several recent studies also show that the representation power of the hyperbolic space can be further improved by endowing the kernel methods. Unfortunately, the known kernel methods, developed in hyperbolic space, are limited by the adaptation capacity or distortion issues. This paper addresses the issues through a novel embedding function. To this end, we propose a curvature-aware isometric embedding, which establishes an isometry from the Poincar\\'e model to a special reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Then we can further define a series of kernels on this RKHS, including several positive definite kernels and an indefinite kernel. Thorough experiments are conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our proposals over existing-known hyperbolic and Euclidean kernels in various learning tasks, e.g., graph learning and zero-shot learning",

    "title": "BARA: Efficient Incentive Mechanism with Online Reward Budget Allocation in Cross-Silo Federated Learning",
    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a prospective distributed machine learning  framework that can preserve data privacy. In particular, cross-silo FL can complete model training by making isolated data islands of different organizations collaborate with a parameter server (PS) via exchanging model parameters for multiple communication rounds. In cross-silo FL, an incentive mechanism is indispensable  for motivating data owners to contribute their models to FL training. However, how to allocate the reward budget among different rounds is an essential but complicated problem  largely overlooked by existing works. The challenge of this problem lies in the opaque feedback between reward budget allocation and model utility improvement of FL, making the optimal reward budget allocation complicated. To address this problem, we design an online reward budget allocation algorithm using Bayesian optimization named BARA (Budget Allocation for Reverse Auction). Specifically, BARA can model the complicated relationship between reward budget allocation and final model accuracy in FL based on historical training records so that the reward budget allocated to each communication round is dynamically optimized so as to maximize the final model utility. We further incorporate the BARA algorithm into reverse auction-based incentive mechanisms to illustrate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments are conducted on real datasets to demonstrate that BARA significantly outperforms competitive baselines by improving  model utility with the same amount of reward budget",

    "abstract": "As a powerful tool for data representation, deep NMF has attracted much attention in recent years. Current deep NMF builds the multi-layer structure by decomposing either basis matrix or feature matrix into multiple factors, and probably complicates the learning process when data is insufficient or exhibits simple structure. To overcome the limitations, a novel method called Generalized Deep Non-negative Matrix Factorization (GDNMF) is proposed, which generalizes several NMF and deep NMF methods in a unified framework. GDNMF simultaneously performs decomposition on both features and bases, which learns a hierarchical data representation based on multi-level basis. To further improve the latent representation and enhance its flexibility, GDNMF mutually reinforces shallow linear model and deep non-linear model. Moreover, semi-supervised GDNMF is proposed by treating partial label information as soft constraints in the multi-layer structure. An efficient two-phase optimization algorithm is developed, and experiments on five real-world datesets verify its superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "Multi-Task Learning via Time-Aware Neural ODE",
    "abstract": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a well-established paradigm for learning shared models for a diverse set of tasks. Moreover, MTL improves data efficiency by jointly training all tasks simultaneously. However, directly optimizing the losses of all the tasks may lead to imbalanced performance on all the tasks due to the competition among tasks for the shared parameters in MTL models. Many MTL methods try to mitigate this problem by dynamically weighting task losses or manipulating task gradients. Different from existing studies, in this paper, we propose a Neural Ordinal diffeRential equation based Multi-tAsk Learning (NORMAL) method to alleviate this issue by modeling task-specific feature transformations from the perspective of dynamic flows built on the Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE). Specifically, the proposed NORMAL model designs a time-aware neural ODE block to learn task-specific time information, which determines task positions of feature transformations in the dynamic flow, in NODE automatically via gradient descent methods. In this way, the proposed NORMAL model handles the problem of competing shared parameters by learning task positions. Moreover, the learned task positions can be used to measure the relevance among different tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed NORMAL model outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models",

    "abstract": "Since Transformers can alleviate some critical and fundamental problems of graph neural networks (GNNs), such as over-smoothing, over-squashing and limited expressiveness, they have been successfully applied to graph representation learning and achieved impressive results. However, although there are many works dedicated to make graph Transformers (GTs) aware of the structure and edge information by specifically tailored attention forms or graph-related positional and structural encodings, few works address the problem of how to construct high-performing GTs with modules of GNNs and Transformers. In this paper, we propose a novel graph Transformer with local and global operators interleaving (LGI-GT), in which we further design a new method propagating embeddings of the [CLS] token for global information representation. Additionally, we propose an effective message passing module called edge enhanced local attention (EELA), which makes LGI-GT a full-attention GT.

    "title": "On the Reuse Bias in Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Importance sampling (IS) is a popular technique in off-policy evaluation, which re-weights the return of trajectories in the replay buffer to boost sample efficiency. However, training with IS can be unstable and previous attempts to address this issue mainly focus on analyzing the variance of IS. In this paper, we reveal that the instability is also related to a new notion of Reuse Bias of IS --- the bias in off-policy evaluation caused by the reuse of the replay buffer for evaluation and optimization. We theoretically show that the off-policy evaluation and optimization of the current policy with the data from the replay buffer result in an overestimation of the objective, which may cause an erroneous gradient update and degenerate the performance. We further provide a high-probability upper bound of the Reuse Bias and show that controlling one term of the upper bound can control the Reuse Bias by introducing the concept of stability for off-policy algorithms. Based on these analyses, we present a novel yet simple Bias-Regularized Importance Sampling (BIRIS) framework along with practical algorithms, which can alleviate the negative impact of the Reuse Bias, and show that our BIRIS can significantly reduce the Reuse Bias empirically. Moreover, extensive experimental results show that our BIRIS-based methods can significantly improve the sample efficiency on a series of continuous control tasks in MuJoCo",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attack is commonly regarded as a huge threat to neural networks because of misleading behavior. This paper presents an opposite perspective: adversarial attacks can be harnessed to improve neural models if amended correctly. Unlike traditional adversarial defense or adversarial training schemes that aim to improve the adversarial robustness, the proposed adversarial amendment (AdvAmd) method aims to improve the original accuracy level of neural models on benign samples. We thoroughly analyze the distribution mismatch between the benign and adversarial samples. This distribution mismatch and the mutual learning mechanism with the same learning ratio applied in prior art defense strategies is the main cause leading the accuracy degradation for benign samples. The proposed AdvAmd is demonstrated to steadily heal the accuracy degradation and even leads to a certain accuracy boost of common neural models on benign classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. The efficacy of the AdvAmd is contributed by three key components: mediate samples (to reduce the influence of distribution mismatch with a fine-grained amendment), auxiliary batch norm (to solve the mutual learning mechanism and the smoother judgment surface), and AdvAmd loss (to adjust the learning ratios according to different attack vulnerabilities) through quantitative and ablation experiments",

    "abstract": "Ultra-fine-grained visual classification (ultra-FGVC) targets at classifying sub-grained categories of fine-grained objects. This inevitably requires discriminative representation learning within a limited training set. Exploring intrinsic features from the object itself, e.g., predicting the rotation of a given image, has demonstrated great progress towards learning discriminative representation. Yet none of these works consider explicit supervision for learning mutual information at instance level. To this end, this paper introduces CLE-ViT, a novel contrastive learning encoded transformer, to address the fundamental problem in ultra-FGVC. The core design is a self-supervised module that performs self-shuffling and masking and then distinguishes these altered images from other images. This drives the model to learn an optimized feature space that has a large inter-class distance while remaining tolerant to intra-class variations. By incorporating this self-supervised module, the network acquires more knowledge from the intrinsic structure of the input data, which improves the generalization ability without requiring extra manual annotations. CLE-ViT demonstrates strong performance on 7 publicly available datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in the ultra-FGVC task. The code is available at https://github.com/Markin-Wang/CLEViT",

In this article, we propose a novel mathematical Structural Information principles-based State Abstraction framework, namely SISA, from the information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, an unsupervised, adaptive hierarchical state clustering method without requiring manual assistance is presented, and meanwhile, an optimal encoding tree is generated. On each non-root tree node, a new aggregation function and condition structural entropy are designed to achieve hierarchical state abstraction and compensate for sampling-induced essential information loss in state abstraction. Empirical evaluations on a visual gridworld domain and six continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with five SOTA state abstraction approaches, SISA significantly improves mean episode reward and sample efficiency up to 18.98 and 44.44%, respectively. Besides, we experimentally show that SISA is a general framework that can be flexibly integrated with different representation-learning objectives to improve their performances further",

    "abstract": "Federated recommendation is a new Internet service architecture that aims to provide privacy-preserving recommendation services in federated settings. Existing solutions are used to combine distributed recommendation algorithms and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Thus it inherently takes the form of heavyweight models at the server and hinders the deployment of on-device intelligent models to end-users. This paper proposes a novel Personalized Federated Recommendation (PFedRec) framework to learn many user-specific lightweight models to be deployed on smart devices rather than a heavyweight model on a server. Moreover, we propose a new dual personalization mechanism to effectively learn fine-grained personalization on both users and items. The overall learning process is formulated into a unified federated optimization framework. Specifically, unlike previous methods that share exactly the same item embeddings across users in a federated system, dual personalization allows mild finetuning of item embeddings for each user to generate user-specific views for item representations which can be integrated into existing federated recommendation methods to gain improvements immediately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of PFedRec and the dual personalization mechanism. Moreover, we provide visualizations and in-depth analysis of the personalization techniques in item embedding, which shed novel insights on the design of recommender systems in federated settings.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries corrupt the global aggregation results and cause denial-of-service (DoS). Unlike recent model poisoning attacks that optimize the amplitude of malicious perturbations along certain prescribed directions to cause DoS, we propose a flexible model poisoning attack (FMPA) that can achieve versatile attack goals. We consider a practical threat scenario where no extra knowledge about the FL system (e.g., aggregation rules or updates on benign devices) is available to adversaries. FMPA exploits the global historical information to construct an estimator that predicts the next round of the global model as a benign reference. It then fine-tunes the reference model to obtain the desired poisoned model with low accuracy and small perturbations. Besides the goal of causing DoS, FMPA can be naturally extended to launch a fine-grained controllable attack, making it possible to precisely reduce the global accuracy. Armed with precise control, malicious FL service providers can gain advantages over their competitors without getting noticed, hence opening a new attack surface in FL other than DoS. Even for the purpose of DoS, experiments show that FMPA significantly decreases the global accuracy, outperforming six state-of-the-art attacks",

But in real-life, models are of ten applied on data with new classes, which can lead to massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance.

Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints\r\n of both cross entropy loss and complement entropy loss, G2Pxy achieves superior effectiveness for unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by experiments on bench\r\nmark graph datasets.

    "abstract": "Neuro-Rule Networks (NRNs) emerge as a promising neuro-symbolic method, enjoyed by the ability to equate fully-connected neural networks with logic rules. To support learning logic rules consisting of boolean variables, converting input features into binary representations is required. Different from discrete features that could be directly transformed by one-hot encodings, continuous features need to be binarized based on some numerical intervals. Existing studies usually select the bound values of intervals based on empirical strategies (e.g., equal-width interval). However, it is not optimal since the bounds are fixed and cannot be optimized to accommodate the ultimate training target. In this paper, we propose AutoInt, an approach that automatically binarizes continuous features and enables the intervals to be optimized with NRNs in an end-to-end fashion. Specifically, AutoInt automatically selects an interval for a given continuous feature in a soft manner to enable a differentiable learning procedure of interval-related parameters. Moreover, it introduces an additional soft K-means clustering loss to make the interval centres approach the original feature value distribution, thus reducing the risk of overfitting intervals. We conduct comprehensive experiments on public datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoInt in boosting the performance of NRNs",

Typically, the existing well-performed methods mainly focus on learning invariant and discriminative features for measuring the relation between multi-modal image pairs. However, these methods often take the features as a whole and largely overlook the fact that different scale features for a same image pair may have different similarity, which may lead to sub-optimal results only. In this work, we propose a Scale-Separative Metric Learning Quadruplet network (SSML-QNet) for multi-modal image patch matching. Specifically, SSML-QNet can extract both relevant and irrelevant features of imaging modality with the proposed quadruplet network architecture. Then, the proposed Scale-Separative Metric Learning module separately encodes the similarity of different scale features with the pyramid structure. And for each scale, cross-modal consistent features are extracted and measured by coordinate and channel-wise attention sequentially. This makes our network robust to appearance divergence caused by different imaging mechanism. Experiments on the benchmark dataset (VIS-NIR, VIS-LWIR, Optical-SAR, and Brown) have verified that the proposed SSML-QNet is able to outperform other state-of-the-art methods.

However, most existing algorithms restrict their focus on the single-machine setting so that they are incapable of dealing with the large communication overhead in a distributed training system. Moreover, most existing communication-efficient optimization algorithms only focus on the traditional minimization problem, failing to handle the minimax optimization problem. To address these challenging issues, in this paper, we develop two novel communication-efficient stochastic gradient descent ascent with momentum algorithms for the distributed minimax optimization problem, which can significantly reduce the communication cost via the two-way compression scheme. However, the compressed momentum makes it considerably challenging to investigate the convergence rate of our algorithms, especially in the presence of the interaction between the minimization and maximization subproblems. In this paper, we successfully addressed these challenges and established the convergence rate of our algorithms for nonconvex-strongly-concave problems. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithms are the first communication-efficient algorithm with theoretical guarantees for the minimax optimization problem. Finally, we apply our algorithm to the distributed AUC maximization problem for the imbalanced data classification task.

The split finding algorithm, which determines the tree construction process, is one of the most crucial components of GBDT. However, the split finding algorithm has long been criticized for its bias towards features with a large number of potential splits. This bias introduces severe interpretability and overfitting issues in GBDT. To this end, we provide a fine-grained analysis of bias in GBDT and demonstrate that the bias originates from 1) the systematic bias in the gain estimation of each split and 2) the bias in the split finding algorithm resulting from the use of the same data to evaluate the split improvement and determine the best split. Based on the analysis, we propose unbiased gain, a new unbiased measurement of gain importance using out-of-bag samples. Moreover, we incorporate the unbiased property into the split finding algorithm and develop UnbiasedGBM to solve the overfitting issue of GBDT. We assess the performance of UnbiasedGBM and unbiased gain in a large-scale empirical study comprising 60 datasets and show that: 1) UnbiasedGBM exhibits better performance than popular GBDT implementations such as LightGBM, XGBoost, and Catboost on average on the 60 datasets and 2) unbiased gain achieves better average performance in feature selection than popular feature importance methods",

In contrast to directly perturbing the messages with predefined DP noise as commonly done in privacy-preserving scenarios, we adopt a stochastic message sender for each agent respectively and incorporate the DP requirement into the sender, which automatically adjusts the learned message distribution to alleviate the instability caused by DP noise. Further, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium in cooperative MARL with privacy-preserving communication, which suggests that this problem is game-theoretically learnable.

    "title": "Graph Neural Convection-Diffusion with Heterophily",
    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results across various graph learning tasks, but they often assume homophily, which can result in poor performance on heterophilic graphs. The connected nodes are likely to be from different classes or have dissimilar features on heterophilic graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN that incorporates the principle of heterophily by modeling the flow of information on nodes using the convection-diffusion equation (CDE). This allows the CDE to take into account both the diffusion of information due to homophily and the ``convection'' of information due to heterophily. We conduct extensive experiments, which suggest that our framework can achieve competitive performance on node classification tasks for heterophilic graphs, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "Reducing Communication for Split Learning by Randomized Top-k Sparsification",
    "abstract": "Split learning is a simple solution for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), which has drawn substantial attention in both research and application due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, communication efficiency is still a crucial issue for split learning. In this paper, we investigate multiple communication reduction methods for split learning, including cut layer size reduction, top-k sparsification, quantization, and L1 regularization. Through analysis of the cut layer size reduction and top-k sparsification, we further propose randomized top-k sparsification, to make the model generalize and converge better. This is done by selecting top-k elements with a large probability while also having a small probability to select non-top-k elements. Empirical results show that compared with other communication-reduction methods, our proposed randomized top-k sparsification achieves a better model performance under the same compression level",

    "title": "MAT: Mixed-Strategy Game of Adversarial Training in Fine-tuning",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained language models has been demonstrated effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Previous studies have established that incorporating adversarial training during the fine-tuning stage can significantly enhance model generalization and robustness. However, from the perspective of game theory, such utilizations of adversarial training correspond to pure-strategy games, which are inherently limited in terms of the scope of their strategies, thereby still having room for improvement. In order to push the performance boundaries, we propose a novel Mixed-strategy Adversarial Training algorithm (MAT). Methodologically, we derive the Nash equilibrium of a mixed-strategy game for adversarial training using Entropy Mirror Descent to establish MAT by sampling method. To verify the effectiveness of MAT, we conducted extensive benchmark experiments on large-scale pre-trained models, such as BERT and RoBERTa. MAT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both the GLUE and ANLI benchmarks in terms of generalization and robustness",

    "title": "pTSE: A Multi-model Ensemble Method for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Various probabilistic time series forecasting models have sprung up and shown remarkably good performance. However, the choice of model highly relies on the characteristics of the input time series and the fixed distribution that model is based on. Due to the fact that the probability distributions cannot be averaged over different models straightforwardly, the current time series model ensemble methods cannot be directly applied to improve the robustness and accuracy of forecasting. To address this issue, we propose pTSE, a multi-model distribution ensemble method for probabilistic forecasting based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM). pTSE only takes off-the-shelf outputs from member models without requiring further information about each model. Besides, we provide a complete theoretical analysis of pTSE to prove that the empirical distribution of time series subject to an HMM will converge to the stationary distribution almost surely. Experiments on benchmarks show the superiority of pTSE over all member models and competitive ensemble methods",

    "title": "Towards Long-delayed Sparsity: Learning a Better Transformer through Reward Redistribution",
    "abstract": "Recently, Decision Transformer (DT) pioneered the offline RL into a contextual conditional sequence modeling paradigm, which leverages self-attended autoregression to learn from global target rewards, states, and actions. However, many applications have a severe delay of the above signals, such as the agent can only obtain a reward signal at the end of each trajectory. This delay causes an unwanted bias cumulating in autoregressive learning global signals. In this paper, we focused its virtual example on episodic reinforcement learning with trajectory feedback. We propose a new reward redistribution algorithm for learning parameterized reward functions, and it decomposes the long-delayed reward onto each timestep. To improve the redistributing's adaptation ability, we formulate the previous decomposition as a bi-level optimization problem for global optimal. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on various benchmarks and demonstrate an overwhelming performance improvement under long-delayed settings",

    "title": "Hierarchical Transformer for Scalable Graph Learning",
    "abstract": "Graph Transformer is gaining increasing attention in the field of machine learning and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks for graph representation learning. However, as current implementations of Graph Transformer primarily focus on learning representations of small-scale graphs, the quadratic complexity of the global self-attention mechanism presents a challenge for full-batch training when applied to larger graphs. Additionally, conventional sampling-based methods fail to capture necessary high-level contextual information, resulting in a significant loss of performance. In this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Scalable Graph Transformer (HSGT) as a solution to these challenges. HSGT successfully scales the Transformer architecture to node representation learning tasks on large-scale graphs, while maintaining high performance. By utilizing graph hierarchies constructed through coarsening techniques, HSGT efficiently updates and stores multi-scale information in node embeddings at different levels. Together with sampling-based training methods, HSGT effectively captures and aggregates multi-level information on the hierarchical graph using only Transformer blocks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that HSGT achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale benchmarks with graphs containing millions of nodes with high efficiency",

    "title": "Causal Deep Reinforcement Learning Using Observational Data",
    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) requires the collection of interventional data, which is sometimes expensive and even unethical in the real world, such as in the autonomous driving and the medical field. Offline reinforcement learning promises to alleviate this issue by exploiting the vast amount of observational data available in the real world. However, observational data may mislead the learning agent to undesirable outcomes if the behavior policy that generates the data depends on unobserved random variables (i.e., confounders). In this paper, we propose two deconfounding methods in DRL to address this problem. The methods first calculate the importance degree of different samples based on the causal inference technique, and then adjust the impact of different samples on the loss function by reweighting or resampling the offline dataset to ensure its unbiasedness. These deconfounding methods can be flexibly combined with existing model-free DRL algorithms such as soft actor-critic and deep Q-learning, provided that a weak condition can be satisfied by the loss functions of these algorithms. We prove the effectiveness of our deconfounding methods and validate them experimentally",

    "title": "Prediction with Incomplete Data under Agnostic Mask Distribution Shift",
    "abstract": "Data with missing values is ubiquitous in many applications. Recent years have witnessed increasing attention on prediction with only incomplete data consisting of observed features and a mask that indicates the missing pattern. Existing methods assume that the training and testing distributions are the same, which may be violated in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider prediction with incomplete data in the presence of distribution shift. We focus on the case where the underlying joint distribution of complete features and label is invariant, but the missing pattern, i.e., mask distribution may shift agnostically between training and testing. To achieve generalization, we leverage the observation that for each mask, there is an invariant optimal predictor. To avoid the exponential explosion when learning them separately, we approximate the optimal predictors jointly using a double parameterization technique. This has the undesirable side effect of allowing the learned predictors to rely on the intra-mask correlation and that between features and mask. We perform decorrelation to minimize this effect. Combining the techniques above, we propose a novel prediction method called StableMiss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that StableMiss is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under agnostic mask distribution shift",

    "title": "Graph Sampling-based Meta-Learning for Molecular Property Prediction",
    "abstract": "Molecular property is usually observed with a limited number of samples, and researchers have considered property prediction as a few-shot problem. One important fact that has been ignored by prior works is that each molecule can be recorded with several different properties simultaneously. To effectively utilize many-to-many correlations of molecules and properties, we propose a Graph Sampling-based Meta-learning (GS-Meta) framework for few-shot molecular property prediction. First, we construct a Molecule-Property relation Graph (MPG): molecule and properties are nodes, while property labels decide edges. Then, to utilize the topological information of MPG,  we reformulate an episode in meta-learning as a subgraph of the MPG, containing a target property node, molecule nodes, and auxiliary property nodes. Third, as episodes in the form of subgraphs are no longer independent of each other, we propose to schedule the subgraph sampling process with a contrastive loss function, which considers the consistency and discrimination of subgraphs. Extensive experiments on 5 commonly-used benchmarks show GS-Meta consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by  5.71%-6.93% in ROC-AUC and verify the effectiveness of each proposed module.
