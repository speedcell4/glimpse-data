We evaluate models from five leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) and find that some LLMs are explicitly designed to favor their developers' products and exhibit untruthful communication, among other manipulative behaviors.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Reward models are critical in techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Inference Scaling Laws, where they guide language model alignment and select optimal responses. Despite their importance, existing reward model benchmarks often evaluate models by asking them to distinguish between responses generated by models of varying power. However, this approach fails to assess reward models on subtle but critical content changes and variations in style, resulting in a low correlation with policy model performance. To this end, we introduce RM-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate reward models based on their sensitivity to subtle content differences and resistance to style biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Bench strongly correlates with policy model performance, making it a reliable reference for selecting reward models to align language models effectively. We evaluate nearly 40 reward models on RM-Bench. Our results reveal that even state-of-the-art models achieve an average performance of only 46.6%, which falls short of random-level accuracy (50%) when faced with style bias interference. These findings highlight the significant room for improvement in current reward models",

We introduce Spider 2.0, an evaluation framework comprising $632$ real-world text-to-SQL workflow problems derived from enterprise-level database use cases. The databases in Spider 2.0 are sourced from real data applications, often containing over 1,000 columns and stored in local or cloud database systems such as BigQuery and Snowflake. We show that solving problems in Spider 2.0 frequently requires understanding and searching through database metadata, dialect documentation, and even project-level codebases. This challenge calls for models to interact with complex SQL workflow environments, process extremely long contexts, perform intricate reasoning, and generate multiple SQL queries with diverse operations, often exceeding $100$ lines, which goes far beyond traditional text-to-SQL challenges. Our evaluations indicate that based on o1-preview, our code agent framework successfully solves only 21.3\\% of the tasks, compared with 91.2\\% on Spider 1.0 and 73.0\\% on BIRD.

We introduce the concept of knowledge entropy, which quantifies the range of memory sources the model engages with; high knowledge entropy indicates that the model utilizes a wide range of memory sources, while low knowledge entropy suggests reliance on specific sources with greater certainty. Our analysis reveals a consistent decline in knowledge entropy as pretraining advances. We also find that the decline is closely associated with a reduction in the model's ability to acquire and retain knowledge, leading us to conclude that diminishing knowledge entropy (smaller number of active memory sources) impairs the model's knowledge acquisition and retention capabilities. We find further support for this by demonstrating that increasing the activity of inactive memory sources enhances the model's capacity for knowledge acquisition and retention",

Contemporary learning-based planning approaches such as imitation learning methods often struggle to balance competing objectives and lack of safety assurance,due to limited adaptability and inadequacy in learning complex multi-modal behaviors commonly exhibited in human planning, not to mention their strong reliance on the fallback strategy with predefined rules. We propose a novel transformer-based Diffusion Planner for closed-loop planning, which can effectively model multi-modal driving behavior and ensure trajectory quality without any rule-based refinement. Our model supports joint modeling of both prediction and planning tasks under the same architecture, enabling cooperative behaviors between vehicles. Moreover, by learning the gradient of the trajectory score function and employing a flexible classifier guidance mechanism, Diffusion Planner effectively achieves safe and adaptable planning behaviors. Evaluations on the large-scale real-world autonomous planning benchmark nuPlan and our newly collected 200-hour delivery-vehicle driving dataset demonstrate that Diffusion Planner achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop performance with robust transferability in diverse driving styles",

    "abstract": "Search and planning are essential for solving many real-world problems. However, in numerous learning scenarios, only action-observation sequences, such as demonstrations or instruction sequences, are available for learning. Relying solely on supervised learning with these sequences can lead to sub-optimal performance due to the vast, unseen search space encountered during training. In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Tree Search Network (D-TSN), a novel neural network architecture that learns to construct search trees from just sequences of demonstrations by performing gradient descent on a best-first search tree construction algorithm. D-TSN enables the joint learning of submodules, including an encoder, value function, and world model, which are essential for planning. To construct the search tree, we employ a stochastic tree expansion policy and formulate it as another decision-making task. Then, we optimize the tree expansion policy via REINFORCE with an effective variance reduction technique for the gradient computation. D-TSN can be applied to problems with a known world model or to scenarios where it needs to jointly learn a world model with a latent state space. We study problems from these two scenarios, including Game of 24, 2D grid navigation, and Procgen games, to understand when D-TSN is more helpful. Through our experiments, we show that D-TSN is effective, especially when the world model with a latent state space is jointly learned.

    "abstract": "LLMs are an integral component of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. While many studies focus on evaluating the overall quality of end-to-end RAG systems, there is a gap in understanding the appropriateness of LLMs for the RAG task. To address this, we introduce Trust-Score, a holistic metric that evaluates the trustworthiness of LLMs within the RAG framework. Our results show that various prompting methods, such as in-context learning, fail to effectively adapt LLMs to the RAG task as measured by Trust-Score. Consequently, we propose Trust-Align, a method to align LLMs for improved Trust-Score performance. 26 out of 27 models aligned using Trust-Align substantially outperform competitive baselines on ASQA, QAMPARI, and ELI5. Specifically, in LLaMA-3-8b, Trust-Align outperforms FRONT on ASQA (↑12.56), QAMPARI (↑36.04), and ELI5 (↑17.69). Trust-Align also significantly enhances models' ability to correctly refuse and provide quality citations. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of Trust-Align across different open-weight models, including the LLaMA series (1b to 8b), Qwen-2.5 series (0.5b to 7b), and Phi3.5 (3.8b).

    "abstract": "Ensuring that generative AI systems align with human values is essential but challenging, especially when considering multiple human values and their potential trade-offs. Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP's ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "In this work, we tackle the following question: Can neural networks trained with gradient-based methods achieve the optimal statistical-computational tradeoff in learning Gaussian single-index models? Prior research has shown that any polynomial-time algorithm under the statistical query (SQ) framework requires $\\Omega(d^{s^\\star/2}\\lor d)$ samples, where $s^\\star$ is the generative exponent representing the intrinsic difficulty of learning the underlying model. However, it remains unknown whether neural networks can achieve this sample complexity. Inspired by prior techniques such as label transformation and landscape smoothing for learning single-index models, we propose a unified gradient-based algorithm for training a two-layer neural network in polynomial time. Our method is adaptable to a variety of loss and activation functions, covering a broad class of existing approaches. We show that our algorithm learns a feature representation that strongly aligns with the unknown signal $\\theta^\\star$, with sample complexity $\\tilde O (d^{s^\\star/2} \\lor d)$, matching the SQ lower bound up to a polylogarithmic factor for all generative exponents $s^\\star\\geq 1$. Furthermore, we extend our approach to the setting where $\\theta^\\star$ is $k$-sparse for $k = o(\\sqrt{d})$ by introducing a novel weight perturbation technique that leverages the sparsity structure. We derive a corresponding SQ lower bound of order $\\tilde\\Omega(k^{s^\\star})$, matched by our method up to a polylogarithmic factor. Our framework, especially the weight perturbation technique, is of independent interest, and suggests potential gradient-based solutions to other problems such as sparse tensor PCA",

    "abstract": "Forecasting is a task that is difficult to evaluate: the ground truth can only be known in the future. Recent work showing LLM forecasters rapidly approaching human-level performance begs the question: how can we benchmark and evaluate these forecasters *instantaneously*? Following the consistency check framework, we measure the performance of forecasters in terms of the consistency of their predictions on different logically-related questions. We propose a new, general consistency metric based on *arbitrage*: for example, if a forecasting AI illogically predicts that both the Democratic and Republican parties have 60\\% probability of winning the 2024 US presidential election, an arbitrageur could trade against the forecaster's predictions and make a profit. We build an automated evaluation system that generates a set of base questions, instantiates consistency checks from these questions, elicits the predictions of the forecaster, and measures the consistency of the predictions. We then build a standard, proper-scoring-rule forecasting benchmark, and show that our (instantaneous) consistency metrics correlate strongly with LLM forecasters' ground truth Brier scores (which are only known in the future). We also release a consistency benchmark that resolves in 2028, providing a long-term evaluation tool for forecasting",

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences becomes a key component to obtaining state-of-the-art performance, but it yields a huge cost to construct a large human-annotated preference dataset. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework, Spread Preference Annotation with direct preference judgment (SPA), that boosts the alignment of LLMs using only a very small amount of human-annotated preference data. Our key idea is leveraging the human prior knowledge within the small (seed) data and progressively improving the alignment of LLM, by iteratively generating the responses and learning from them with the self-annotated preference data. To be specific, we propose to derive the preference label from the logits of LLM to explicitly extract the model's inherent preference. Compared to the previous approaches using external reward models or implicit in-context learning, we observe that the proposed approach is significantly more effective. In addition, we introduce a noise-aware preference learning algorithm to mitigate the risk of low quality within generated preference data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly boosts the alignment of LLMs. For example, we achieve superior alignment performance on AlpacaEval 2.0 with only 3.3% of the ground-truth preference labels in the Ultrafeedback data compared to the cases using the entire data or state-of-the-art baselines",

Mathematically, this model (named the Brain Bandit Net, or BBN) is a special type of stochastic continuous Hopfield network. We show through theory and simulation that BBN can perform posterior sampling of action values with a tunable bias towards or against uncertain options. We then demonstrate that, in multi-armed bandit (MAB) tasks, BBN can generate probabilistic choice behavior with a flexible uncertainty bias resembling human and animal choice patterns. In addition to its high efficiency in MAB tasks, BBN can also be embedded with reinforcement learning algorithms to accelerate learning in MDP tasks.

In this work, we observe an intriguing phenomenon: the context reliance of the model decreases as instruction finetuning progresses, $\\textit{despite an initial expected increase}$. We call this phenomenon as the $\\textbf{context-parametric inversion}$. This is surprising, as one would expect instruction tuning to improve the model's ability to follow input instructions. We observe this behavior on multiple general purpose instruction tuning datasets such as TULU, Alpaca and Ultrachat, across multiple model families like Llama, Mistral and Pythia. We perform various controlled studies to eliminate some simple hypothesis for this observed behavior and isolate what datapoints cause this counter-intuitive behavior. We then analyze the phenomenon theoretically, to explain why context reliance varies across the trajectory of finetuning. We tie the observed context-parametric inversion to the properties of the finetuning data, which provides us with some potential mitigation strategies that provide limited but insightful gains",

For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring the combination of multiple strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge, including in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG",

    "title": "Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally Can be More Effective than Scaling Parameters for Reasoning",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time compute is a critical step towards building self-improving agents that can operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we scale up inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on performance, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how to tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Little research has attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of test-time inference methods, with current work largely providing negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models (PRMs); and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to, as effectively as possible, allocate test-time compute per prompt in an adaptive manner. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling for math reasoning problems by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model",

    "title": "Capturing the Temporal Dependence of Training Data Influence",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Traditional data influence estimation methods, like influence function, assume that learning algorithms are permutation-invariant with respect to training data. However, modern training paradigms—especially for foundation models using stochastic algorithms and non-convergent, multi-stage curricula—are sensitive to data ordering, thus violating this assumption. This mismatch renders influence functions inadequate for answering some critical questions in current machine learning: How can we differentiate the influence of the same data contributing at different stages of training? More generally, how can we capture the dependence of data influence on the optimization trajectory during training? To address this gap, we formalize the concept of \\emph{trajectory-specific leave-one-out (LOO) influence}, which quantifies the impact of removing a data point from a specific iteration during training, accounting for the exact sequence of data encountered and the model's optimization trajectory. However, exactly evaluating the trajectory-specific LOO presents a significant computational challenge. To address this, we propose \\emph{data value embedding}, a novel technique enabling efficient approximation of trajectory-specific LOO. Specifically, we compute a training data embedding that encapsulates the cumulative interactions between data and the evolving model parameters. The LOO can then be efficiently approximated through a simple dot-product between the data value embedding and the gradient of the given test data. As data value embedding captures training data ordering, it offers valuable insights into model training dynamics. In particular, we uncover distinct phases of data influence, revealing that data points in the early and late stages of training exert a greater impact on the final model. These insights translate into actionable strategies for managing the computational overhead of data selection by strategically timing the selection process, potentially opening new avenues in data curation research",

    "title": "Self-Improvement in Language Models: The Sharpening Mechanism",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Recent work in language modeling has raised the possibility of \"self-improvement,\" where an LLM evaluates and refines its own generations to achieve higher performance without external feedback. It is impossible for this self-improvement to create information that is not already in the model, so why should we expect that this will lead to improved capabilities? We offer a new theoretical perspective on the capabilities of self-improvement through a lens we refer to as \"sharpening.\" Motivated by the observation that language models are often better at verifying response quality than they are at generating correct responses, we formalize self-improvement as using the model itself as a verifier during post-training in order to ‘sharpen' the model to one placing large mass on high-quality sequences, thereby amortizing the expensive inference-time computation of generating good sequences. We begin by introducing a new statistical framework for sharpening in which the learner has sample access to a pre-trained base policy. Then, we analyze two natural families of self improvement algorithms based on SFT and RLHF. We find that (i) the SFT-based approach is minimax optimal whenever the initial model has sufficient coverage, but (ii) the RLHF-based approach can improve over SFT-based self- improvement by leveraging online exploration, bypassing the need for coverage. We view these findings as a starting point toward a foundational understanding that can guide the design and evaluation of self-improvement algorithms",

However, the traditional notion of Data Shapley requires re-training models on various data subsets, which becomes computationally infeasible for large-scale models. Additionally, this retraining-based definition cannot evaluate the contribution of data for a specific model training run, which may often be of interest in practice. This paper introduces a novel concept, In-Run Data Shapley, which eliminates the need for model retraining and is specifically designed for assessing data contribution for a particular model of interest. In-Run Data Shapley calculates the Shapley value for each gradient update iteration and accumulates these values throughout the training process. We present several techniques that allow the efficient scaling of In-Run Data Shapley to the size of foundation models. In its most optimized implementation, our method adds negligible runtime overhead compared to standard model training. This dramatic efficiency improvement makes it possible to perform data attribution for the foundation model pretraining stage.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (Llama-2-7b-chat, Mistral-7b-instruct, Vicuna-7b). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S. lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has achieved great success in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Prevalent RLHF approaches are reward-based, following the Bradley-Terry (BT) model assumption, which may not fully capture the complexity of human preferences. In this paper, we explore RLHF under a general preference framework and approach it from a game-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a two-player game and propose a novel online algorithm, iterative Nash policy optimization (INPO). The key idea is to let the policy play against itself via no- regret learning, thereby approximating the Nash policy. Unlike previous methods, INPO bypasses the need for estimating the expected win rate for individual responses, which typically incurs high computational or annotation costs. Instead, we introduce a new loss objective that is directly minimized over a preference dataset. We provide theoretical analysis for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on various representative benchmarks. With an LLaMA-3-8B-based SFT model, INPO achieves a 42.6% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0 and a 37.8% win rate on Arena-Hard, showing substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art online RLHF algorithms",

Unlike prior work based on Gaussian diffusion or conditional diffusion models, we propose a new form of diffusion model with uniform noise in the forward process, whose negative ELBO corresponds to the end-to-end compression cost using universal quantization.

Taking advantage of residual-like architectural designs, we introduce Highway backpropagation, a parallelizable iterative algorithm that approximates backpropagation, by alternatively i) accumulating the gradient estimates along the residual path, and ii) backpropagating them through every layer in parallel. This algorithm is naturally derived from a decomposition of the gradient as the sum of gradients flowing through all paths, and is adaptable to a diverse set of common architectures, ranging from ResNets and Transformers to recurrent neural networks.

They operate by maintaining a set of vectors---often referred to as the codebook---and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in the codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the gradient to the encoder flows _around_ the vector quantization layer rather than _through_ it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be undesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost. In this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector quantization layer of VQ-VAEs. We smoothly transform each encoder output into its corresponding codebook vector via a rotation and rescaling linear transformation that is treated as a constant during backpropagation. As a result, the relative magnitude and angle between encoder output and codebook vector becomes encoded into the gradient as it propagates through the vector quantization layer and back to the encoder. Across 11 different VQ-VAE training paradigms, we find this restructuring improves reconstruction metrics, codebook utilization, and quantization error",

We also show that the emergence of these plans coincides with the emergence of a planning-like property: the ability to benefit from additional test-time compute. Finally, we perform a qualitative analysis of the planning algorithm learned by the agent and discover a strong resemblance to parallelized bidirectional search.

First, through a comprehensive evaluation across twelve benchmarks, we found that while the popular Square Exponential (SE) kernel often leads to poor performance, using Mat\\'ern kernels enables standard BO to consistently achieve top-tier results, frequently surpassing methods specifically designed for high-dimensional optimization. Second, our theoretical analysis reveals that the SE kernel's failure primarily stems from improper initialization of the length-scale parameters, which are commonly used in practice but can cause gradient vanishing in training. We provide a probabilistic bound to characterize this issue, showing that Mat\\'ern kernels are less susceptible and can robustly handle much higher dimensions. Third, we propose a simple robust initialization strategy that dramatically improves the performance of the SE kernel, bringing it close to state-of-the-art methods, without requiring additional priors or regularization.

    "abstract": "High quality annotations are increasingly a bottleneck in the explosively growing machine learning ecosystem. Scalable evaluation methods that avoid costly annotation have therefore become an important research ambition. Many hope to use strong existing models in lieu of costly labels to provide cheap model evaluations. Unfortunately, this method of using models as judges introduces biases, such as self-preferencing, that can distort model comparisons. An emerging family of debiasing tools promises to fix these issues by using a few high quality labels to debias a large number of model judgments. In this paper, we study how far such debiasing methods, in principle, can go. Our main result shows that when the judge is no more accurate than the evaluated model, no debiasing method can decrease the required amount of ground truth labels by more than half. Our result speaks to the severe limitations of the LLM-as-a-judge paradigm at the evaluation frontier where the goal is to assess newly released models that are possibly better than the judge. Through an empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the sample size savings achievable in practice are even more modest than what our theoretical limit suggests. Along the way, our work provides new observations about debiasing methods for model evaluation, and points out promising avenues for future work",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We propose Reference-Based Modulation (RB-Modulation), a new plug-and-play solution for training-free personalization of diffusion models. Existing training-free approaches exhibit difficulties in (a) style extraction from reference images in the absence of additional style or content text descriptions, (b) unwanted content leakage from reference style images, and (c) effective composition of style and content. RB-Modulation is built on a novel stochastic optimal controller where a style descriptor encodes the desired attributes through a terminal cost. The resulting drift not only overcomes the difficulties above, but also ensures high fidelity to the reference style and adheres to the given text prompt. We also introduce a cross-attention-based feature aggregation scheme that allows RB-Modulation to decouple content and style from the reference image. With theoretical justification and empirical evidence, our test-time optimization framework demonstrates precise extraction and control of *content* and *style* in a training-free manner. Further, our method allows a seamless composition of content and style, which marks a departure from the dependency on external adapters or ControlNets.

    "abstract": "While large models trained with self-supervised learning on offline datasets have shown remarkable capabilities in text and image domains, achieving the same generalisation for agents that act in sequential decision problems remains an open challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by procedurally generating tens of millions of 2D physics-based tasks and using these to train a general reinforcement learning (RL) agent for physical control. To this end, we introduce Kinetix: an open-ended space of physics-based RL environments that can represent tasks ranging from robotic locomotion and grasping to video games and classic RL environments, all within a unified framework. Kinetix makes use of our novel hardware-accelerated physics engine Jax2D that allows us to cheaply simulate billions of environment steps during training. Our trained agent exhibits strong physical reasoning capabilities in 2D space, being able to zero-shot solve unseen human-designed environments. Furthermore, fine-tuning this general agent on tasks of interest shows significantly stronger performance than training an RL agent *tabula rasa*. This includes solving some environments that standard RL training completely fails at. We believe this demonstrates the feasibility of large scale, mixed-quality pre-training for online RL and we hope that Kinetix will serve as a useful framework to investigate this further",

    "abstract": "In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of individual neurons are often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. Here, we show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e., feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies",

    "abstract": "Supervised learning has become a cornerstone of modern machine learning, yet a comprehensive theory explaining its effectiveness remains elusive. Empirical phenomena, such as neural analogy-making and the linear representation hypothesis, suggest that supervised models can learn interpretable factors of variation in a linear fashion. Recent advances in self-supervised learning, particularly nonlinear Independent Component Analysis, have shown that these methods can recover latent structures by inverting the data generating process. We extend these identifiability results to parametric instance discrimination, then show how insights transfer to the ubiquitous setting of supervised learning with cross-entropy minimization. We prove that even in standard classification tasks, models learn representations of ground-truth factors of variation up to a linear transformation under a certain DGP. We corroborate our theoretical contribution with a series of empirical studies. First, using simulated data matching our theoretical assumptions, we demonstrate successful disentanglement of latent factors. Second, we show that on DisLib, a widely-used disentanglement benchmark, simple classification tasks recover latent structures up to linear transformations. Finally, we reveal that models trained on ImageNet encode representations that permit linear decoding of proxy factors of variation. Together, our theoretical findings and experiments offer a compelling explanation for recent observations of linear representations, such as superposition in neural networks.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (LRNNs) such as Mamba, RWKV, GLA, mLSTM, and DeltaNet have emerged as efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences. However, both Transformers and LRNNs struggle to perform state-tracking, which may impair performance in tasks such as code evaluation. In one forward pass, current architectures are unable to solve even parity, the simplest state-tracking task, which non-linear RNNs can handle effectively. Recently, Sarrof et al. (2024) demonstrated that the failure of LRNNs like Mamba to solve parity stems from restricting the value range of their diagonal state-transition matrices to $[0, 1]$ and that incorporating negative values can resolve this issue. We extend this result to non-diagonal LRNNs such as DeltaNet. We prove that finite precision LRNNs with state-transition matrices having only positive eigenvalues cannot solve parity, while non-triangular matrices are needed to count modulo $3$. Notably, we also prove that LRNNs can learn any regular language when their state-transition matrices are products of identity minus vector outer product matrices, each with eigenvalues in the range $[-1, 1]$. Our experiments confirm that extending the eigenvalue range of Mamba and DeltaNet to include negative values not only enables them to solve parity but consistently improves their performance on state-tracking tasks. We also show that state-tracking enabled LRNNs can be pretrained stably and efficiently at scale (1.3B parameters), achieving competitive performance on language modeling and showing promise on code and math tasks",

    "abstract": "Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training, but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is predictive of the subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions, revealing that latent codes acquired during training are reused to solve unseen problem instances. To further examine the hypothesis that the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention supports compositional generalization, we ablate whether making the hypernetwork-generated linear value network nonlinear strengthens compositionality. We find that this modification improves compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices human intelligence test, which gives us precise control over the problem compositions encountered during training and evaluation. We demonstrate on this task how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization in transformers and gives rise to a functionally structured latent space",

We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by \\citet{Wies23}. We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \\emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. Our findings, supported by numerical experiments, show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve multi-step reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT",

Inspired by cortical dynamics of biological neural networks, we base our proposed LinOSS model on a system of forced harmonic oscillators. A stable discretization, integrated over time using fast associative parallel scans, yields the proposed state-space model. We prove that LinOSS produces stable dynamics only requiring nonnegative diagonal state matrix. This is in stark contrast to many previous state-space models relying heavily on restrictive parameterizations. Moreover, we rigorously show that LinOSS is universal, i.e., it can approximate any continuous and causal operator mapping between time-varying functions, to desired accuracy. In addition, we show that an implicit-explicit discretization of LinOSS perfectly conserves the symmetry of time reversibility of the underlying dynamics. Together, these properties enable efficient modeling of long-range interactions, while ensuring stable and accurate long-horizon forecasting. Finally, our empirical results, spanning a wide range of time-series tasks from mid-range to very long-range classification and regression, as well as long-horizon forecasting, demonstrate that our proposed LinOSS model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models. Notably, LinOSS outperforms Mamba and LRU by nearly 2x on a sequence modeling task with sequences of length 50k",

Recent advancements in Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of high-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches often suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the reconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy problem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based Bayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative model to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the latent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the reconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive normalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each token based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method demonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly outperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches",

Sampling from pre-trained DPMs involves multiple neural function evaluations (NFEs) to transform Gaussian noise samples into images, resulting in higher computational costs compared to single-step generative models such as GANs or VAEs. Therefore, reducing the number of NFEs while preserving generation quality is crucial. To address this, we propose LD3, a lightweight framework designed to learn the optimal time discretization for sampling.

Motivated by language model alignment methods, we propose Condition Contrastive Alignment (CCA) to facilitate guidance-free AR visual generation. Unlike guidance methods that alter the sampling process to achieve the ideal sampling distribution, CCA directly fine-tunes pretrained models to fit the same distribution target. Experimental results show that CCA can significantly enhance the guidance-free performance of all tested models with just one epoch of fine-tuning (1% of pretraining epochs) on the pretraining dataset. This largely removes the need for guided sampling in AR visual generation and cuts the sampling cost by half. Moreover, by adjusting training parameters, CCA can achieve trade-offs between sample diversity and fidelity similar to CFG.

Traditional time series models often struggle to capture universal patterns, limiting their effectiveness across diverse tasks. To address this, we define multiple scales in the time domain and various resolutions in the frequency domain, employing various mixing strategies to extract intricate, task-adaptive time series patterns. Specifically, we introduce TimeMixer++, a general-purpose TSPM that processes multi-scale time series using (1) multi-resolution time imaging (MRTI), (2) time image decomposition (TID), (3) multi-scale mixing (MCM), and (4) multi-resolution mixing (MRM) to extract comprehensive temporal patterns. MRTI transforms multi-scale time series into multi-resolution time images, capturing patterns across both temporal and frequency domains. TID leverages dual-axis attention to extract seasonal and trend patterns, while MCM hierarchically aggregates these patterns across scales. MRM adaptively integrates all representations across resolutions.

It contains three fundamental sub-tasks: interactive segmentation, panoptic segmentation, and video instance segmentation. Unlike previous methods, which use a specific design for each task, we aim to use only a single end-to-end model to accomplish all these tasks in real-time. To meet real-time requirements and balance multi-task learning, we present a novel dynamic convolution-based method, Real-Time Multi-Purpose SAM (RMP-SAM). It contains an efficient encoder and an efficient decoupled adapter to perform prompt-driven decoding. Moreover, we further explore different training strategies and one new adapter design to boost co-training performance further. We benchmark several strong baselines by extending existing works to support our multi-purpose segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RMP-SAM is effective and generalizes well on proposed benchmarks and other specific semantic tasks. Our implementation of RMP-SAM achieves the optimal balance between accuracy and speed for these tasks. The code is released at \\url{https://github.com/xushilin1/RAP-SAM}",

ProfileBFN extends the discrete Bayesian Flow Network from an MSA profile perspective, which can be trained on single protein sequences by regarding it as a degenerate profile, thereby achieving efficient protein family design by avoiding large-scale MSA data construction and training. Empirical results show that ProfileBFN has a profound understanding of proteins. When generating diverse and novel family proteins, it can accurately capture the structural characteristics of the family. The enzyme produced by this method is more likely than the previous approach to have the corresponding function, offering better odds of generating diverse proteins with the desired functionality",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Retrieving gene functional networks from knowledge databases presents a challenge due to the mismatch between disease networks and subtype-specific variations. Current solutions, including statistical and deep learning methods, often fail to effectively integrate gene interaction knowledge from databases or explicitly learn subtype-specific interactions. To address this mismatch, we propose GeSubNet, which learns a unified representation capable of predicting gene interactions while distinguishing between different disease subtypes. Graphs generated by such representations can be considered subtype-specific networks. GeSubNet is a multi-step representation learning framework with three modules: First, a deep generative model learns distinct disease subtypes from patient gene expression profiles. Second, a graph neural network captures representations of prior gene networks from knowledge databases, ensuring accurate physical gene interactions. Finally, we integrate these two representations using an inference loss that leverages graph generation capabilities, conditioned on the patient separation loss, to refine subtype-specific information in the learned representation. GeSubNet consistently outperforms traditional methods, with average improvements of 30.6%, 21.0%, 20.1%, and 56.6% across four graph evaluation metrics, averaged over four cancer datasets. Particularly, we conduct a biological simulation experiment to assess how the behavior of selected genes from over 11,000 candidates affects subtypes or patient distributions. The results show that the generated network has the potential to identify subtype-specific genes with an 83% likelihood of impacting patient distribution shifts",

We demonstrate that the properties of activation functions—specifically smoothness and nonlinearity—are critical to the training dynamics. Smooth activation functions guarantee globally unique solutions for both forward and backward ODEs, while sufficient nonlinearity is essential for maintaining the spectral properties of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) during training. Together, these properties enable us to establish the global convergence of Neural ODEs under gradient descent in overparameterized regimes.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced AI with their exceptional performance across a wide range of tasks. However, their extensive computational requirements restrict their use on devices with limited resources. While recent compression methods based on low-rank matrices show potential solutions, they often suffer from significant loss of accuracy or introduce substantial overhead in parameters and inference time. In this paper, we introduce Modular De- composition (MoDeGPT), a new, efficient, and structured compression framework that overcomes these limitations. MoDeGPT jointly decomposes pairs of consecu- tive subcomponents within Transformer blocks, reduces hidden dimensions through output reconstruction on a larger structural scale than conventional low-rank meth- ods, and repurposes three classical matrix decomposition algorithms—Nyström approximation, CR decomposition, and SVD—to ensure bounded errors in our novel decomposition approach. Our experiments show that MoDeGPT, without relying on backward propagation, consistently matches or surpasses the performance of prior techniques that depend on gradient information, while achieving a 98% reduction in compute costs when compressing a 13B-parameter model. On LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models, MoDeGPT retains 90-95% of zero-shot performance with compression rates of 25-30%. The compression process can be completed on a single GPU in a few hours, boosting inference throughput by up to 46%",

    "abstract": "While the human brain efficiently handles various computations with a limited number of neurons, traditional deep learning networks require a significant increase in parameters to improve performance. Yet, these parameters are used inefficiently as the networks employ the same amount of computation for inputs of the same size, regardless of the input's complexity. We address this inefficiency by introducing self-introspection capabilities to the network, enabling it to adjust the number of used parameters based on the internal representation of the task and adapt the computation time based on the task complexity. This enables the network to adaptively reuse parameters across tasks, dynamically adjusting the computational effort to match the complexity of the input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on language modeling and computer vision tasks. Notably, our model achieves 96.62\\% accuracy on ImageNet with just a three-layer network, surpassing much larger ResNet-50 and EfficientNet. When applied to a transformer architecture, the approach achieves 95.8\\%/88.7\\% F1 scores on the SQuAD v1.1/v2.0 datasets at negligible parameter cost.

We propose a novel framework, DRAFT, aimed at Dynamically Refining tool documentation through the Analysis of Feedback and Trials emanating from LLMs' interactions with external tools.

This process is further optimized by implementing a diversity-promoting exploration strategy to ensure explorative diversity and a tool-adaptive termination mechanism to prevent overfitting while enhancing efficiency. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAFT's iterative, feedback-based refinement significantly ameliorates documentation quality, fostering a deeper comprehension and more effective utilization of tools by LLMs. Notably, our analysis reveals that the tool documentation refined via our approach demonstrates robust cross-model generalization capabilities",

    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders provide a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from a language model by reconstructing activations from a sparse bottleneck layer. Since language models learn many concepts, autoencoders need to be very large to recover all relevant features. However, studying the properties of autoencoder scaling is difficult due to the need to balance reconstruction and sparsity objectives and the presence of dead latents. We propose using k-sparse autoencoders [Makhzani and Frey, 2013] to directly control sparsity, simplifying tuning and improving the reconstruction-sparsity frontier. Additionally, we find modifications that result in few dead latents, even at the largest scales we tried. Using these techniques, we find clean scaling laws with respect to autoencoder size and sparsity. We also introduce several new metrics for evaluating feature quality based on the recovery of hypothesized features, the explainability of activation patterns, and the sparsity of downstream effects. These metrics all generally improve with autoencoder size. To demonstrate the scalability of our approach, we train a 16 million latent autoencoder on GPT-4 activations for 40 billion tokens.

    "abstract": "Post-training Large Language Models (LLMs) with explicit reasoning trajectories can enhance their reasoning abilities. However, acquiring such high-quality trajectory data typically demands meticulous supervision from humans or superior models, which can be either expensive or license-constrained. In this paper, we explore how far an LLM can improve its reasoning by self-synthesizing reasoning paths as training data without any additional supervision. Existing self-synthesizing methods, such as STaR, suffer from poor generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) reasoning tasks. We hypothesize it is due to that their self-synthesized reasoning paths are too task-specific, lacking general task-agnostic reasoning guidance. To address this, we propose **Reasoning Generalist via Self-Improvement (ReGenesis)**, a method to *self-synthesize reasoning paths as post-training data by progressing from abstract to concrete*. More specifically, ReGenesis self-synthesizes reasoning paths by converting general reasoning guidelines into task-specific ones, generating reasoning structures, and subsequently transforming these structures into reasoning paths, without the need for human-designed task-specific examples used in existing methods. We show that ReGenesis achieves superior performance on all in-domain and OOD settings tested compared to existing methods. For six OOD tasks specifically, while previous methods exhibited an average performance decrease of approximately 4.6% after post training, ReGenesis delivers around 6.1% performance improvement. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of our framework and show ReGenesis is effective across various language models and design choices",

Using sparse autoencoders as an interpretability tool, we discover that a key part of these mechanisms is entity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall facts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the representation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g. detecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This shows that models can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own capabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the model to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate attributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. We demonstrate that despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these directions have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior, suggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism. Furthermore, we provide an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of these directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of downstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token",

We show that training dynamics of a two layer neural policy induce a low dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying dimensionality.

    "abstract": "Task arithmetic refers to editing the pre-trained model by adding a weighted sum of task vectors, each of which is the weight update from the pre-trained model to fine-tuned models for certain tasks. This approach recently gained attention as a computationally efficient inference method for model editing, e.g., multi-task learning, forgetting, and out-of-domain generalization capabilities. However, the theoretical understanding of why task vectors can execute various conceptual operations remains limited, due to the highly non-convexity of training Transformer-based models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of the generalization guarantees of task vector methods on nonlinear Transformers. We consider a conceptual learning setting, where each task is a binary classification problem based on a discriminative pattern. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of task addition in simultaneously learning a set of irrelevant or aligned tasks, as well as the success of task negation in unlearning one task from irrelevant or contradictory tasks. Moreover, we prove the proper selection of linear coefficients for task arithmetic to achieve guaranteed generalization to out-of-domain tasks. All of our theoretical results hold for both dense-weight parameters and their low-rank approximations.

    "abstract": "Understanding how sensory neurons exhibit selectivity to certain features and invariance to others is central to uncovering the computational principles underlying robustness and generalization in visual perception. Most existing methods for characterizing selectivity and invariance identify single or finite discrete sets of stimuli. Since these are only isolated measurements from an underlying continuous manifold, characterizing invariance properties accurately and comparing them across neurons with varying receptive field size, position, and orientation, becomes challenging. Consequently, a systematic analysis of invariance types at the population level remains under-explored. Building on recent advances in learning continuous invariance manifolds, we introduce a novel method to accurately identify and align invariance manifolds of visual sensory neurons, overcoming these challenges. Our approach first learns the continuous invariance manifold of stimuli that maximally excite a neuron modeled by a response-predicting deep neural network. It then learns an affine transformation on the pixel coordinates such that the same manifold activates another neuron as strongly as possible, effectively aligning their invariance manifolds spatially. This alignment provides a principled way to quantify and compare neuronal invariances irrespective of receptive field differences. Using simulated neurons, we demonstrate that our method accurately learns and aligns known invariance manifolds, robustly identifying functional clusters. When applied to macaque V1 neurons, it reveals functional clusters of neurons, including simple and complex cells. Overall, our method enables systematic, quantitative exploration of the neural invariance landscape, to gain new insights into the functional properties of visual sensory neurons",

To strike a balance between scalability and minimal supervision, we introduce Feedback Schrödinger Bridge Matching (FSBM), a novel semi-supervised matching framework that incorporates a small portion ($<8$% of the entire dataset) of pre-aligned pairs as state feedback to guide the transport map of non-coupled samples, thereby significantly improving efficiency. This is achieved by formulating a static Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem with an additional term capturing the semi-supervised guidance. The generalized EOT objective is then recast into a dynamic formulation to leverage the scalability of matching frameworks.

However, the effectiveness of these agents hinges on the robustness of their grounding capability. Current GUI agents predominantly utilize text-based representations such as HTML or accessibility trees, which, despite their utility, often introduce noise, incompleteness, and increased computational overhead. In this paper, we advocate a human-like embodiment for GUI agents that perceive the environment entirely visually and directly perform pixel-level operations on the GUI. The key is visual grounding models that can accurately map diverse referring expressions of GUI elements to their coordinates on the GUI across different platforms. We show that a simple recipe, which includes web-based synthetic data and slight adaptation of the LLaVA architecture, is surprisingly effective for training such visual grounding models. We collect the largest dataset for GUI visual grounding so far, containing 10M GUI elements and their referring expressions over 1.3M screenshots, and use it to train UGround, a strong universal visual grounding model for GUI agents. Empirical results on six benchmarks spanning three categories (grounding, offline agent, and online agent) show that 1) UGround substantially outperforms existing visual grounding models for GUI agents, by up to 20\\% absolute, and 2) agents with UGround outperform state-of-the-art agents, despite the fact that existing agents use additional text-based input while ours only uses visual perception. These results provide strong support for the feasibility and promises of GUI agents that navigate the digital world as humans do",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation leverages a teacher model to improve the training of a student model. A persistent challenge is that a better teacher does not always yield a better student, to which a common mitigation is to use additional supervision from several \"intermediate\" teachers. One empirically validated variant of this principle is progressive distillation, where the student learns from successive intermediate checkpoints of the teacher. Using sparse parity as a sandbox, we identify an implicit curriculum as one mechanism through which progressive distillation accelerates the student's learning. This curriculum is available only through the intermediate checkpoints but not the final converged one, and imparts both empirical acceleration and a provable sample complexity benefit to the student. We then extend our investigation to Transformers trained on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) and real-world pre-training datasets (Wikipedia and Books). Through probing the teacher model, we identify an analogous implicit curriculum where the model progressively learns features that capture longer context. Our theoretical and empirical findings on sparse parity, complemented by empirical observations on more complex tasks, highlight the benefit of progressive distillation via implicit curriculum across setups",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear *why* this model --- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching --- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization, this is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of *order consistency* in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Moreover, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations",

Among these, inference-time strategies that impose constraints via post-processing have shown promise in addressing the complexities of copyright regulation.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Copyright-Protecting Model Fusion (CP-Fuse), a novel approach that combines models trained on disjoint sets of copyrighted material during inference. In particular, CP-Fuse adaptively aggregates the model outputs to minimize the reproduction of copyrighted content, adhering to a crucial balancing property to prevent the regurgitation of memorized data. Through extensive experiments, we show that CP-Fuse significantly reduces the reproduction of protected material without compromising the quality of text and code generation. Moreover, its post-hoc nature allows seamless integration with other protective measures, further enhancing copyright safeguards. Lastly, we show that CP-Fuse is robust against common techniques for extracting training data",

However, when it comes to controllable video generation, ControlNets cannot be directly integrated into new backbones due to feature space mismatches, and training ControlNets for new backbones can be a significant burden for many users. Furthermore, applying ControlNets independently to different frames can not effectively maintain object temporal consistency. To address these challenges, we introduce Ctrl-Adapter, an efficient and versatile framework that adds diverse controls to any image/video diffusion models through the adaptation of pretrained ControlNets. Ctrl-Adapter offers strong and diverse capabilities, including image and video control, sparse-frame video control, fine-grained patch-level multi-condition control, zero-shot adaptation to unseen conditions, and supports a variety of downstream tasks beyond spatial control, including video editing, video style transfer, and text-guided motion control. With six diverse U-Net/DiT-based image/video diffusion models (SDXL, PixArt-α, I2VGen-XL, SVD, Latte, Hotshot-XL), Ctrl-Adapter matches the performance of pretrained ControlNets on COCO and achieves the state-of-the-art on DAVIS 2017 with significantly lower computation (< 10 GPU hours)",

Consequently, they must provide reliable probability or confidence estimation, especially in large-scale decision-making and planning tasks. Current large language models (LLMs) are insufficient for accurate estimations, but they can generate relevant factors that may affect the probabilities, produce coarse-grained probabilities when the information is more complete, and help determine which factors are relevant to specific downstream contexts. In this paper, we make use of these capabilities of LLMs to provide a significantly more accurate probabilistic estimation. We propose BIRD, a novel probabilistic inference framework that aligns a Bayesian network with LLM abductions and then estimates more accurate probabilities in a deduction step. We show BIRD provides reliable probability estimations that are 30% better than those provided directly by LLM baselines.

    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques have shown great potential in enhancing macro placement, a critical stage in modern chip design. However, existing methods primarily focus on *online* optimization of *intermediate surrogate metrics* that are available at the current placement stage, rather than directly targeting the *cross-stage metrics*---such as the timing performance---that measure the final chip quality. This is mainly because of the high computational costs associated with performing post-placement stages for evaluating such metrics, making the *online* optimization impractical. Consequently, these optimizations struggle to align with actual performance improvements and can even lead to severe manufacturing issues. To bridge this gap, we propose **LaMPlace**, which **L**earns **a** **M**ask for optimizing cross-stage metrics in macro placement. Specifically, LaMPlace trains a predictor on *offline* data to estimate these *cross-stage metrics* and then leverages the predictor to quickly generate a mask, i.e., a pixel-level feature map that quantifies the impact of placing a macro in each chip grid location on the design metrics. This mask essentially acts as a fast evaluator, enabling placement decisions based on *cross-stage metrics* rather than *intermediate surrogate metrics*. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPlace significantly improves the chip quality across several key design metrics, achieving an average improvement of 9.6\\%, notably 43.0\\% and 30.4\\% in terms of WNS and TNS, respectively, which are two crucial cross-stage metrics that reflect the final chip quality in terms of the timing performance",

While current benchmarks have shown that LLMs can solve tasks using programs like human developers, the majority of their evaluations are limited to short and self-contained algorithmic tasks or standalone function calls. Solving challenging and practical tasks requires the capability of utilizing **diverse function calls as tools** to efficiently implement functionalities like data analysis and web development. In addition, using multiple tools to solve a task needs compositional reasoning by accurately understanding **complex instructions**. Fulfilling both of these characteristics can pose a great challenge for LLMs. To assess how well LLMs can solve challenging and practical tasks via programs, we introduce BigCodeBench, a benchmark that challenges LLMs to invoke multiple function calls as tools from 139 libraries and 7 domains for 1,140 fine-grained tasks. To evaluate LLMs rigorously, each task encompasses 5.6 test cases with an average branch coverage of 99%. In addition, we propose a natural-language-oriented variant of BigCodeBench, BigCodeBench-Instruct, that automatically transforms the original docstrings into short instructions containing only essential information. Our extensive evaluation of 60 LLMs shows that **LLMs are not yet capable of following complex instructions to use function calls precisely, with scores up to 60%, significantly lower than the human performance of 97%**.

Traditionally, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test has been the primary measure for evaluating GNN expressiveness. However, high-order WL tests can be obscure, making it challenging to discern the specific graph patterns captured by them. Given the connection between WL tests and first-order logic, some have explored the logical expressiveness of Message Passing Neural Networks. This paper aims to establish a comprehensive and systematic relationship between GNNs and logic. We propose a framework for identifying the equivalent logical formulas for arbitrary GNN architectures, which not only explains existing models, but also provides inspiration for future research. As case studies, we analyze multiple classes of prominent GNNs within this framework, unifying different subareas of the field. Additionally, we conduct a detailed examination of homomorphism expressivity from a logical perspective and present a general method for determining the homomorphism expressivity of arbitrary GNN models, as well as addressing several open problems",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the denoising process in (generative) diffusion models can induce meaningful (discriminative) representations inside the model, though the quality of these representations still lags behind those learned through recent self-supervised learning methods. We argue that one main bottleneck in training large-scale diffusion models for generation lies in effectively learning these representations. Moreover, training can be made easier by incorporating high-quality external visual representations, rather than relying solely on the diffusion models to learn them independently. We study this by introducing a straightforward regularization called REPresentation Alignment (REPA), which aligns the projections of noisy input hidden states in denoising networks with clean image representations obtained from external, pretrained visual encoders. The results are striking: our simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality when applied to popular diffusion and flow-based transformers, such as DiTs and SiTs. For instance, our method can speed up SiT training by over 17.5$\\times$, matching the performance (without classifier-free guidance) of a SiT-XL model trained for 7M steps in less than 400K steps. In terms of final generation quality, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results of FID=1.42 using classifier-free guidance with the guidance interval",

    "abstract": "Last-iterate convergence behaviours of well-known algorithms are intensively investigated in various games, such as two-player bilinear zero-sum games. However, most known last-iterate convergence properties rely on strict settings where the underlying games must have time-invariant payoffs. Besides, the limited known attempts on the games with time-varying payoffs are in two-player bilinear time-varying zero-sum games and strictly monotone games. By contrast, in other time-varying games, the last-iterate behaviours of two classic algorithms, i.e., extra gradient (EG) and optimistic gradient (OG) algorithms, still lack research, especially the convergence rates in multi-player games. In this paper, we investigate the last-iterate behaviours of EG and OG algorithms for convergent perturbed games, which extend upon the usual model of time-invariant games and incorporate external factors, such as vanishing noises. Using the recently proposed notion of the tangent residual (or its modifications) as the potential function of games and the measure of proximity to the Nash equilibrium, we prove that the last-iterate convergence rates of EG and OG algorithms for perturbed games on bounded convex closed sets are $O({1}/{\\sqrt{T}})$ if such games converge to monotone games at rates fast enough and that such a result holds true for certain unconstrained perturbed games. With this result, we address an open question asking for the last-iterate convergence rate of EG and OG algorithms in constrained and time-varying settings. The above convergence rates are similar to known tight results on corresponding time-invariant games",

While large language models (LLMs) effectively leverage Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for fine-tuning on human preference data without the need for reward models, diffusion models have not been extensively explored in this area. Current preference learning methods applied to T2I diffusion models immediately adapt existing techniques from LLMs. However, this direct adaptation introduces an estimated loss specific to T2I diffusion models. This estimation can potentially lead to suboptimal performance through our empirical results. In this work, we propose Direct Score Preference Optimization (DSPO), a novel algorithm that aligns the pretraining and fine-tuning objectives of diffusion models by leveraging score matching, the same objective used during pretraining. It introduces a new perspective on preference learning for diffusion models. Specifically, DSPO distills the score function of human-preferred image distributions into pretrained diffusion models, fine-tuning the model to generate outputs that align with human preferences. We theoretically show that DSPO shares the same optimization direction as reinforcement learning algorithms in diffusion models under certain conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that DSPO outperforms preference learning baselines for T2I diffusion models in human preference evaluation tasks and enhances both visual appeal and prompt alignment of generated images",

TANGO builds on Gesture Video Reenactment (GVR), which splits and retrieves video clips using a directed graph structure - representing video frames as nodes and valid transitions as edges. We address two key limitations of GVR: audio-motion misalignment and visual artifacts in GAN-generated transition frames. In particular, i) we propose retrieving gestures using latent feature distance to improve cross-modal alignment. To ensure the latent features could effectively model the relationship between speech audio and gesture motion, we implement a hierarchical joint embedding space (AuMoClip); ii) we introduce the diffusion-based model to generate high-quality transition frames. Our diffusion model, Appearance Consistent Interpolation (ACInterp), is built upon AnimateAnyone and includes a reference motion module and homography background flow to preserve appearance consistency between generated and reference videos.

This paper presents an end-to-end paradigm that predicts actions using inverse dynamics models conditioned on the robot's forecasted visual states, named Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models (PIDM). By closing the loop between vision and action, the end-to-end PIDM can be a better scalable action learner. In practice, we use Transformers to process both visual states and actions, naming the model Seer. It is initially pre-trained on large-scale robotic datasets, such as DROID, and can be adapted to real-world scenarios with a little fine-tuning data. Thanks to large-scale, end-to-end training and the continuous synergy between vision and action at each execution step, Seer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both simulation and real-world experiments. It achieves improvements of 13% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark, 22% on CALVIN ABC-D, and 43% in real-world tasks.

However, 3DGS training currently occurs on a single GPU, limiting its ability to handle high-resolution and large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks due to memory constraints. We introduce Grendel, a distributed system designed to partition 3DGS parameters and parallelize computation across multiple GPUs. As each Gaussian affects a small, dynamic subset of rendered pixels, Grendel employs sparse all-to-all communication to transfer the necessary Gaussians to pixel partitions and performs dynamic load balancing. Unlike existing 3DGS systems that train using one camera view image at a time, Grendel supports batched training with multiple views. We explore various optimization hyperparameter scaling strategies and find that a simple sqrt(batch-size) scaling rule is highly effective. Evaluations using large-scale, high-resolution scenes show that Grendel enhances rendering quality by scaling up 3DGS parameters across multiple GPUs. On the 4K ``Rubble'' dataset, we achieve a test PSNR of 27.28 by distributing 40.4 million Gaussians across 16 GPU, compared to a PSNR of 26.28 using 11.2 million Gaussians on a single GPU.

Our work addresses the issue, moving away from unconstrained features and studying DNNs that end with at least two linear layers. We first prove generic guarantees on neural collapse that assume \\emph{(i)} low training error and balancedness of linear layers (for within-class variability collapse), and \\emph{(ii)} bounded conditioning of the features before the linear part (for orthogonality of class-means, and their alignment with weight matrices). The balancedness refers to the fact that $W_{\\ell+1}^\\top W_{\\ell+1}\\approx W_\\ell W_\\ell ^\\top$ for any pair of consecutive weight matrices of the linear part, and the bounded conditioning requires a well-behaved ratio between largest and smallest non-zero singular values of the features. We then show that such assumptions hold for gradient descent training with weight decay: \\emph{(i)} for networks with a wide first layer, we prove low training error and balancedness, and \\emph{(ii)} for solutions that are either nearly optimal or stable under large learning rates, we additionally prove the bounded conditioning. Taken together, our results are the first to show neural collapse in the end-to-end training of DNNs",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Supervised machine learning techniques are increasingly being adopted to speed up electronic structure predictions, serving as alternatives to first-principles methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT). Although current DFT datasets mainly emphasize chemical properties and atomic forces, the precise prediction of electronic charge density is essential for accurately determining a system's total energy and ground state properties. In this study, we introduce a novel electronic charge density dataset named ECD, which encompasses 140,646 stable crystal geometries with medium-precision Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional data. Within this dataset, a subset of 7,147 geometries includes high-precision electronic charge density data calculated using the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) functional in DFT. By designing various benchmark tasks for crystalline materials and emphasizing training with large-scale PBE data while fine-tuning with a smaller subset of high-precision HSE data, we demonstrate the efficacy of current machine learning models in predicting electronic charge densities. The ECD dataset and baseline models are open-sourced to support community efforts in developing new methodologies and accelerating materials design and applications",

    "abstract": "Data-driven techniques have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving PDEs. For time-dependent PDEs, many approaches are Markovian---the evolution of the trained system only depends on the current state, and not the past states. In this work, we investigate the benefits of using memory for modeling time-dependent PDEs: that is, when past states are explicitly used to predict the future. Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig theory of model reduction, we theoretically exhibit examples of simple (even linear) PDEs, in which a solution that uses memory is arbitrarily better than a Markovian solution. Additionally, we introduce Memory Neural Operator (MemNO), a neural operator architecture that combines recent state space models (specifically, S4) and Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) to effectively model memory. We empirically demonstrate that when the PDEs are supplied in low resolution or contain observation noise at train and test time, MemNO significantly outperforms the baselines without memory---with up to $6 \\times$ reduction in test error. Furthermore, we show that this benefit is particularly pronounced when the PDE solutions have significant high-frequency Fourier modes (e.g., low-viscosity fluid dynamics) and we construct a challenging benchmark dataset consisting of such PDEs",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) with foundation models has recently emerged as a promising paradigm to exploit abundant knowledge acquired during pre-training for tackling sequential tasks. However, existing prompt-based and Low-Rank Adaptation-based (LoRA-based) methods often require expanding a prompt/LoRA pool or retaining samples of previous tasks, which poses significant scalability challenges as the number of tasks grows. To address these limitations, we propose Scalable Decoupled LoRA (SD-LoRA) for class incremental learning, which continually separates the learning of the magnitude and direction of LoRA components without rehearsal. Our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals that SD-LoRA tends to follow a low-loss trajectory and converges to an overlapping low-loss region for all learned tasks, resulting in an excellent stability-plasticity trade-off. Building upon these insights, we introduce two variants of SD-LoRA with further improved parameter efficiency. All parameters of SD-LoRAs can be end-to-end optimized for CL objectives. Meanwhile, they support efficient inference by allowing direct evaluation with the finally trained model, obviating the need for component selection. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks and foundation models consistently validate the effectiveness of SD-LoRA. The code is available at https://github.com/WuYichen-97/SD-Lora-CL",

    "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have attracted substantial attention in pathology, serving as backbones for applications such as zero-shot image classification and Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis. Additionally, they can function as vision encoders when combined with large language models (LLMs) to support broader capabilities. Current efforts to train pathology VLMs rely on pathology image-text pairs from platforms like PubMed, YouTube, and Twitter, which provide limited, unscalable data with generally suboptimal image quality. In this work, we leverage large-scale WSI datasets like TCGA to extract numerous high-quality image patches. We then train a large multimodal model (LMM) to generate captions for extracted images, creating PathGen-1.6M, a dataset containing 1.6 million high-quality image-caption pairs. Our approach involves multiple agent models collaborating to extract representative WSI patches, generating and refining captions to obtain high-quality image-text pairs. Extensive experiments show that integrating these generated pairs with existing datasets to train a pathology-specific CLIP model, PathGen-CLIP, significantly enhances its ability to analyze pathological images, with substantial improvements across nine pathology-related zero-shot image classification tasks and three whole-slide image tasks. Furthermore, we construct 200K instruction-tuning data based on PathGen-1.6M and integrate PathGen-CLIP with the Vicuna LLM to create more powerful multimodal models through instruction tuning. Overall, we provide a scalable pathway for high-quality data generation in pathology, paving the way for next-generation general pathology models.

    "abstract": "We study a fundamental problem in the evaluation of large language models that we call training on the test task. Unlike wrongful practices like training on the test data, leakage, or data contamination, training on the test task is not a malpractice. Rather, the term describes a growing set of techniques to include task-relevant data in the pretraining stage of a language model. We demonstrate that training on the test task confounds both relative model evaluations and claims about emergent capabilities. We argue that the seeming superiority of one model family over another may be explained by a different degree of training on the test task. To this end, we propose an effective method to adjust for the effect of training on the test task on benchmark evaluations. Put simply, to fine-tune each model under comparison on the same task-relevant data before evaluation. Lastly, we show that instances of emergent behavior disappear gradually as models train on the test task. Our work promotes a new perspective on the evaluation of large language models with broad implications for benchmarking and the study of emergent capabilities",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) on graphs enables collaborative model training to enhance performance without compromising the privacy of each client. However, existing methods often overlook the mutable nature of graph data, which frequently introduces new nodes and leads to shifts in label distribution. Since they focus solely on performing well on each client's local data, they are prone to overfitting to their local distributions (i.e., local overfitting), which hinders their ability to generalize to unseen data with diverse label distributions. In contrast, our proposed method, FedLoG, effectively tackles this issue by mitigating local overfitting. Our model generates global synthetic data by condensing the reliable information from each class representation and its structural information across clients. Using these synthetic data as a training set, we alleviate the local overfitting problem by adaptively generalizing the absent knowledge within each local dataset. This enhances the generalization capabilities of local models, enabling them to handle unseen data effectively. Our model outperforms baselines in our proposed experimental settings, which are designed to measure generalization power to unseen data in practical scenarios.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is an open research problem. Existing evaluations rely on deterministic point estimates generated via greedy decoding. However, we find that deterministic evaluations fail to capture the whole output distribution of a model, yielding inaccurate estimations of model capabilities. This is particularly problematic in critical contexts such as unlearning and alignment, where precise model evaluations are crucial. To remedy this, we introduce the first formal probabilistic evaluation framework for LLMs. Namely, we propose novel metrics with high probability guarantees concerning the output distribution of a model. Our metrics are application-independent and allow practitioners to make more reliable estimates about model capabilities before deployment. Our experimental analysis reveals that deterministic evaluations falsely indicate successful unlearning and alignment, whereas our probabilistic evaluations better capture model capabilities. We show how to overcome challenges associated with probabilistic outputs in a case study on unlearning by introducing (1) a novel loss based on entropy optimization, and (2) adaptive temperature scaling. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances unlearning in probabilistic settings on recent benchmarks. Overall, our proposed shift from point estimates to probabilistic evaluations of output distributions represents an important step toward comprehensive evaluations of LLMs",

For instance, randomized algorithms excel in adversarial settings, often surpassing the worst-case performance of deterministic algorithms with large margins.

In this paper, we enhance deep neural networks, in particular transformer models, with randomization. We demonstrate for the first time that randomized algorithms can be instilled in transformers through learning, in a purely data- and objective-driven manner. First, we analyze known adversarial objectives for which randomized algorithms offer a distinct advantage over deterministic ones. We then show that common optimization techniques, such as gradient descent or evolutionary strategies, can effectively learn transformer parameters that make use of the randomness provided to the model. To illustrate the broad applicability of randomization in empowering neural networks, we study three conceptual tasks: associative recall, graph coloring, and agents that explore grid worlds. In addition to demonstrating increased robustness against oblivious adversaries through learned randomization, our experiments reveal remarkable performance improvements due to the inherently random nature of the neural networks' computation and predictions",

In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield single-task robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot for any object within the same category in any environment. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling in imitation learning. By collecting data across numerous environments and objects, we study how a policy's generalization performance changes with the number of training environments, objects, and demonstrations. Throughout our research, we collect over 40,000 demonstrations and execute more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts under a rigorous evaluation protocol. Our findings reveal several intriguing results: the generalization performance of the policy follows a roughly power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects. The diversity of environments and objects is far more important than the absolute number of demonstrations; once the number of demonstrations per environment or object reaches a certain threshold, additional demonstrations have minimal effect. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient data collection strategy.

We first present a multi-marginal Doob's $h$-transform to construct a continuous dynamical system conditioned on these irregular observations. Following this, we introduce a variational inference algorithm with a tight evidence lower bound (ELBO), leveraging stochastic optimal control (SOC) theory to approximate the intractable Doob's $h$-transform and simulate the conditioned dynamics. To improve efficiency and scalability during both training and inference, ACSSM leverages auxiliary variable to flexibly parameterize the latent dynamics and amortized control. Additionally, it incorporates a simulation-free latent dynamics framework and a transformer-based data assimilation scheme, facilitating parallel inference of the latent states and ELBO computation. Through empirical evaluations across a variety of real-world datasets, ACSSM demonstrates superior performance in tasks such as classification, regression, interpolation, and extrapolation, while maintaining computational efficiency",

Achieving high win rates on these benchmarks can significantly boost the promotional impact of newly released language models. This promotional benefit may motivate tricks, such as manipulating model output length or style to game win rates, even though several mechanisms have been developed to control length and disentangle style to reduce gameability. Nonetheless, we show that even a **\"null model\"** that always outputs a **constant** response (*irrelevant to input instructions*) can cheat automatic benchmarks and achieve top-ranked win rates: an $86.5\\\\%$ LC win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0; an $83.0$ score on Arena-Hard-Auto; and a $9.55$ score on MT-Bench. Moreover, the crafted cheating outputs are **transferable** because we assume that the instructions of these benchmarks (e.g., $805$ samples of AlpacaEval 2.0) are *private* and cannot be accessed. While our experiments are primarily proof-of-concept, an adversary could use LLMs to generate more imperceptible cheating responses, unethically benefiting from high win rates and promotional impact.

    "abstract": "Extensive research efforts have been put into characterizing and constructing maximally separating multiset and graph neural networks. However, recent empirical evidence suggests the notion of separation itself doesn't capture several interesting phenomena. On the one hand, the quality of this separation may be very weak, to the extent that the embeddings of \"separable\" objects might even be considered identical when using fixed finite precision. On the other hand, architectures which aren't capable of separation in theory, somehow achieve separation when taking the network to be wide enough. In this work, we address both of these issues, by proposing a novel pair-wise separation quality analysis framework which is based on an adaptation of Lipschitz and Hölder stability to parametric functions. The proposed framework, which we name Hölder in expectation, allows for separation quality analysis, without restricting the analysis to embeddings that can separate all the input space simultaneously. We prove that common sum-based models are lower-Hölder in expectation, with an exponent that decays rapidly with the network's depth . Our analysis leads to adversarial examples of graphs which can be separated by three 1-WL iterations, but cannot be separated in practice by standard maximally powerful Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs). To remedy this, we propose two novel MPNNs with improved separation quality, one of which is lower Lipschitz in expectation. We show these MPNNs can easily classify our adversarial examples, and compare favorably with standard MPNNs on standard graph learning tasks",

The conformal hypothesis proposes that this neural manifold is a conformal isometric embedding of 2D physical space, where local physical distance is preserved by the embedding up to a scaling factor (or unit of metric). Such distance-preserving position embedding is indispensable for path planning in navigation, especially planning local straight path segments. We conduct numerical experiments to show that this hypothesis leads to the hexagonal grid firing patterns by learning maximally distance-preserving position embedding, agnostic to the choice of the recurrent neural network.

Recent advancements in file selection primarily rely on using an existing or trained proxy model to assess the similarity of samples to a target domain, such as high quality sources BookCorpus and Wikipedia. However, upon revisiting these methods, the domain-similarity selection criteria demonstrates a diversity dilemma, i.e. dimensional collapse in the feature space, improving performance on the domain-related tasks but causing severe degradation on generic performance.To prevent collapse and enhance diversity, we propose a DiverSified File selection algorithm (DiSF), which selects the most decorrelated text files in the feature space. We approach this with a classical greedy algorithm to achieve more uniform eigenvalues in the feature covariance matrix of the selected texts, analyzing its approximation to the optimal solution under a formulation of $\\gamma$-weakly submodular optimization problem. Empirically, we establish a benchmark and conduct extensive experiments on the TinyLlama architecture with models from 120M to 1.1B parameters. Evaluating across nine tasks from the Harness framework, DiSF demonstrates a significant improvement on overall performance.

Remarkably, our method consistently generates connected and sparse graphs with the edge-to-node ratio being bounded above by 3. Our graphs' rigidity guarantees that edge distances and dihedral angles are sufficient to uniquely determine the general spatial arrangements of atoms. We substantiate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed graphs in various molecular modeling benchmarks. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Utah-Math-Data-Science/UnitSphere}",

    "abstract": "How much of my data was used to train a machine learning model? This is a critical question for data owners assessing the risk of unauthorized usage of their data to train models. However, previous work mistakenly treats this as a binary problem—inferring whether all-or-none or any-or-none of the data was used—which is fragile when faced with real, non-binary data usage risks. To address this, we propose a fine-grained analysis called Dataset Usage Cardinality Inference (DUCI), which estimates the exact proportion of data used. Our algorithm, leveraging debiased membership guesses, matches the performance of the optimal MLE approach (with a maximum error <0.1) but with significantly lower (e.g., $300 \\times$ less) computational cost",

    "title": "LARP: Tokenizing Videos with a Learned Autoregressive Generative Prior",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We present LARP, a novel video tokenizer designed to overcome limitations in current video tokenization methods for autoregressive (AR) generative models. Unlike traditional patchwise tokenizers that directly encode local visual patches into discrete tokens, LARP introduces a holistic tokenization scheme that gathers information from the visual content using a set of learned holistic queries. This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic representations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information. Furthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of discrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the specific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with downstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent space. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent space that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also structured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation. Moreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens, progressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training, ensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LARPs strong performance, achieving state-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation benchmark. LARP enhances the compatibility of AR models with videos and opens up the potential to build unified high-fidelity multimodal large language models (MLLMs).

    "title": "MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging $\\textit{cross-corruption}$ scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation. Source code: https://github.com/zhuoxiao-chen/MOS",

    "abstract": "Pretraining on large-scale, unstructured internet text enables language models to acquire a significant amount of world knowledge. However, this knowledge acquisition is data-inefficient---to learn a fact, models must be trained on hundreds to thousands of diverse representations of it. This poses a challenge when adapting a pretrained model to a small corpus of domain-specific documents, where each fact may appear rarely or only once. We propose to bridge this gap with synthetic continued pretraining: using the small domain-specific corpus to synthesize a large corpus more amenable to learning, and then performing continued pretraining on the synthesized corpus. We instantiate this proposal with EntiGraph, a synthetic data augmentation algorithm that extracts salient entities from the source corpus and then generates diverse text by drawing connections between those entities. Synthetic continued pretraining with EntiGraph enables a language model to answer questions and follow generic instructions related to the source documents without access to them. If the source documents are instead available at inference time, we show that the knowledge acquired through our approach compounds with retrieval-augmented generation. To better understand these results, we build a simple mathematical model of EntiGraph, and show how synthetic data augmentation can \"rearrange\" knowledge to enable more data-efficient learning",

    "abstract": "Embodied tasks require the agent to fully understand 3D scenes simultaneously with its exploration, so an online, real-time, fine-grained and highly-generalized 3D perception model is desperately needed. Since high-quality 3D data is limited, directly training such a model in 3D is infeasible. Meanwhile, vision foundation models (VFM) has revolutionized the field of 2D computer vision with superior performance, which makes the use of VFM to assist embodied 3D perception a promising direction. However, most existing VFM-assisted 3D perception methods are either offline or too slow that cannot be applied in practical embodied tasks. In this paper, we aim to leverage Segment Anything Model (SAM) for real-time 3D instance segmentation in an online setting. This is a challenging problem since future frames are not available in the input streaming RGB-D video, and an instance may be observed in several frames so efficient object matching between frames is required. To address these challenges, we first propose a geometric-aware query lifting module to represent the 2D masks generated by SAM by 3D-aware queries, which is then iteratively refined by a dual-level query decoder. In this way, the 2D masks are transferred to fine-grained shapes on 3D point clouds. Benefit from the query representation for 3D masks, we can compute the similarity matrix between the 3D masks from different views by efficient matrix operation, which enables real-time inference. Experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, SceneNN and 3RScan show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online 3D perception models, even outperforming offline VFM-assisted 3D instance segmentation methods by a large margin. Our method also demonstrates great generalization ability in several zero-shot dataset transferring experiments and show great potential in data-efficient setting",

    "abstract": "A significant roadblock to the development of principled multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms is the fact that desired solution concepts like Nash equilibria may be intractable to compute. We show how one can overcome this obstacle by introducing concepts from behavioral economics into MARL. To do so, we imbue agents with two key features of human decision-making: risk aversion and bounded rationality. We show that introducing these two properties into games gives rise to a class of equilibria---risk-averse quantal response equilibria (RQE)---which are tractable to compute in \\emph{all} $n$-player matrix and finite-horizon Markov games. In particular, we show that they emerge as the endpoint of no-regret learning in suitably adjusted versions of the games. Crucially, the class of computationally tractable RQE is independent of the underlying game structure and only depends on agents' degrees of risk-aversion and bounded rationality. To validate the expressivity of this class of solution concepts we show that it captures peoples' patterns of play in a number of 2-player matrix games previously studied in experimental economics. Furthermore, we give a first analysis of the sample complexity of computing these equilibria in finite-horizon Markov games when one has access to a generative model.

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) poses a significant challenge in machine learning, where a model forgets previously learned information upon learning new tasks. Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they continue to face challenges with CF during continual learning. The majority of existing research focuses on analyzing forgetting patterns through a singular training sequence, thereby overlooking the intricate effects that diverse tasks have on model behavior. Our study explores CF across various settings, discovering that model forgetting is influenced by both the specific training tasks and the models themselves. To this end, we interpret forgetting by examining the function vector (FV), a compact representation of functions in LLMs, offering a model-dependent indicator for the occurrence of CF. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we demonstrated that CF in LLMs primarily stems from biases in function activation rather than the overwriting of task processing functions. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel function vector guided training methodology, incorporating a regularization technique to stabilize the FV and mitigate forgetting. Empirical tests on four benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed training method, substantiating our theoretical framework concerning CF and model function dynamics",

We introduce Shortcut Models, a family of generative models that use a single network and training phase to produce high-quality samples in a single or multiple sampling steps. Shortcut models condition the network not only on the current noise level but also on the desired step size, allowing the model to skip ahead in the generation process. Across a wide range of sampling step budgets, shortcut models consistently produce higher quality samples than previous approaches, such as consistency models and reflow. Compared to distillation, shortcut models reduce complexity to a single network and training phase and additionally allow varying step budgets at inference time",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "The performance of large language models (LLMs) is closely linked to their underlying size, leading to ever-growing networks and hence slower inference. Speculative decoding has been proposed as a technique to accelerate autoregressive generation, leveraging a fast draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified in parallel based on their likelihood under the target model. While this approach guarantees to reproduce the target output, it incurs a substantial penalty: many high-quality draft tokens are rejected, even when they represent objectively valid continuations. Indeed, we show that even powerful draft models such as GPT-4o, as well as human text cannot achieve high acceptance rates under the standard verification scheme. This severely limits the speedup potential of current speculative decoding methods, as an early rejection becomes overwhelmingly likely when solely relying on alignment of draft and target. We thus ask the following question: Can we adapt verification to recognize correct, but non-aligned replies? To this end, we draw inspiration from the LLM-as-a-judge framework, which demonstrated that LLMs are able to rate answers in a versatile way. We carefully design a dataset coined TokenCourt to elicit the same capability in the target model by training a compact module on top of the embeddings to produce ``judgements\" of the current continuation. We showcase our strategy on the Llama-3.1 family, where our 8B/405B-Judge achieves a speedup of $9\\times$ over Llama-405B, while maintaining its quality on a large range of benchmarks.

Despite initial efforts to defend against specific graph backdoor attacks, there is no work on defending against various types of backdoor attacks where generated triggers have different properties. Hence, we first empirically verify that prediction variance under edge dropping is a crucial indicator for identifying poisoned nodes. With this observation, we propose using random edge dropping to detect backdoors and theoretically show that it can efficiently distinguish poisoned nodes from clean ones. Furthermore, we introduce a novel robust training strategy to efficiently counteract the impact of the triggers.

Inspired by the success of large Vision-Language (ViL) models in many applications, the latest research has validated ViL's benefit for SFDA by using their predictions as pseudo supervision. However, we observe that ViL's supervision could be noisy and inaccurate at an unknown rate, potentially introducing additional negative effects during adaption. To address this thus-far ignored challenge, we introduce a novel Proxy Denoising (__ProDe__) approach. The key idea is to leverage the ViL model as a proxy to facilitate the adaptation process towards the latent domain-invariant space. Concretely, we design a proxy denoising mechanism to correct ViL's predictions. This is grounded on a proxy confidence theory that models the dynamic effect of proxy's divergence against the domain-invariant space during adaptation. To capitalize the corrected proxy, we further derive a mutual knowledge distilling regularization. Extensive experiments show that ProDe significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art alternatives under both conventional closed-set setting and the more challenging open-set, partial-set, generalized SFDA, multi-target, multi-source, and test-time settings.

Policymakers, model providers, and researchers in the AI and cybersecurity communities are interested in quantifying the capabilities of such agents to help mitigate cyberrisk and investigate opportunities for penetration testing. Toward that end, we introduce Cybench, a framework for specifying cybersecurity tasks and evaluating agents on those tasks. We include 40 professional-level Capture the Flag (CTF) tasks from 4 distinct CTF competitions, chosen to be recent, meaningful, and spanning a wide range of difficulties. Each task includes its own description, starter files, and is initialized in an environment where an agent can execute commands and observe outputs. Since many tasks are beyond the capabilities of existing LM agents, we introduce subtasks for each task, which break down a task into intermediary steps for a more detailed evaluation. To evaluate agent capabilities, we construct a cybersecurity agent and evaluate 8 models: GPT-4o, OpenAI o1-preview, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mixtral 8x22b Instruct, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B Chat, and Llama 3.1 405B Instruct.

This high computation cost is typically due to their heavy reliance on aggregated clip features from multi-view, which require computationally expensive 2D foundation models like Segment Anything (SAM) and CLIP. Consequently, this hampers their applicability in many real-world applications that require both fast and accurate predictions. To this end, we propose a novel open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation approach, named Open-YOLO 3D, that efficiently leverages only 2D object detection from multi-view RGB images for open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation. We demonstrate that our proposed Multi-View Prompt Distribution (MVPDist) method makes use of multi-view information to account for misclassification from the object detector to predict a reliable label for 3D instance masks. Furthermore, since projections of 3D object instances are already contained within the 2D bounding boxes, we show that our proposed low granularity label maps, which require only a 2D object detector to construct, are sufficient and very fast to predict prompt IDs for 3D instance masks when used with our proposed MVPDist. We validate our Open-YOLO 3D on two benchmarks, ScanNet200 and Replica, under two scenarios: (i) with ground truth masks, where labels are required for given object proposals, and (ii) with class-agnostic 3D proposals generated from a 3D proposal network.

We note that many of these vulnerabilities are related to a shared underlying issue: safety alignment can take shortcuts, wherein the alignment adapts a model's generative distribution primarily over only its very first few output tokens. We unifiedly refer to this issue as shallow safety alignment. In this paper, we present case studies to explain why shallow safety alignment can exist and show how this issue universally contributes to multiple recently discovered vulnerabilities in LLMs, including the susceptibility to adversarial suffix attacks, prefilling attacks, decoding parameter attacks, and fine-tuning attacks. The key contribution of this work is that we demonstrate how this consolidated notion of shallow safety alignment sheds light on promising research directions for mitigating these vulnerabilities. We show that deepening the safety alignment beyond the first few tokens can meaningfully improve robustness against some common exploits. We also design a regularized fine-tuning objective that makes the safety alignment more persistent against fine-tuning attacks by constraining updates on initial tokens.

    "abstract": "Cascades and speculative decoding are two common approaches to improving language models' inference efficiency. Both approaches interleave two models, but via fundamentally distinct mechanisms: deferral rule that invokes the larger model only for \"hard\" inputs, while speculative decoding uses speculative execution to primarily invoke the larger model in parallel scoring mode. These mechanisms offer different benefits: empirically, cascades offer compelling cost-quality trade-offs, often even outperforming the large model; speculative cascades offer impressive speed-ups, while guaranteeing quality-neutrality. In this paper, we leverage the best of both these approaches by designing new speculative cascading techniques that implement their deferral rule through speculative execution. We characterize the optimal deferral rule for our speculative cascades, and employ a plug-in approximation to the optimal rule. Experiments with Gemma and T5 models on a range of language benchmarks show that our approach yields better cost quality trade-offs than cascading and speculative decoding baselines",

    "title": "The Hidden Cost of Waiting for Accurate Predictions",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic predictions are increasingly informing societal resource allocations by identifying individuals for targeting. Policymakers often build these systems with the assumption that by gathering more observations on individuals, they can improve predictive accuracy and, consequently, allocation efficiency. An overlooked yet consequential aspect of prediction-driven allocations is that of timing. The planner has to trade off relying on earlier and potentially noisier predictions to intervene before individuals experience undesirable outcomes, or they may wait to gather more observations to make more precise allocations. We examine this tension using a simple mathematical model, where the planner collects observations on individuals to improve predictions over time. We analyze both the ranking induced by these predictions and optimal resource allocation. We show that though individual prediction accuracy improves over time, counter-intuitively, the average ranking loss can worsen. As a result, the planner's ability to improve social welfare can decline. We identify inequality as a driving factor behind this phenomenon. Our findings provide a nuanced perspective and challenge the conventional wisdom that it is preferable to wait for more accurate predictions to ensure the most efficient allocations",

    "abstract": "Learning dynamics, which describes how the learning of specific training examples influences the model's predictions on other examples, gives us a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning systems. We study the learning dynamics of large language models during different types of finetuning, by analyzing the step-wise decomposition of how influence accumulates among different potential responses. Our framework allows a uniform interpretation of many interesting observations about the training of popular algorithms for both instruction tuning and preference tuning. In particular, we propose a hypothetical explanation of why specific types of hallucination are strengthened after finetuning, e.g., the model might use phrases or facts in the response for question B to answer question A, or the model might keep repeating similar simple phrases when generating responses. We also extend our framework and highlight a unique ``squeezing effect'' to explain a previously observed phenomenon in off-policy direct preference optimization (DPO), where running DPO for too long makes even the desired outputs less likely. This framework also provides insights into where the benefits of on-policy DPO and other variants come from. The analysis not only provides a novel perspective of understanding LLM's finetuning but also inspires a simple, effective method to improve alignment performance",

Hand-specifying ellipsoids enables users to control the location, size, orientation, secondary structure, and approximate shape of protein substructures. Conditioning on ellipsoids of existing proteins enables redesigning their substructure's connectivity or editing substructure properties. By conditioning on novel and diverse ellipsoid layouts from a simple statistical model, we improve protein generation with expanded Pareto frontiers between designability, novelty, and diversity.

    "abstract": "The trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs) refers to the extent to which their outputs are reliable, safe, and ethically aligned, and it has become a crucial consideration alongside their cognitive performance. In practice, Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely used to align LLMs with labeled human preferences, but its assumed effect on model trustworthiness hasn't been rigorously evaluated. To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigates how models aligned with general-purpose preference data perform across five trustworthiness verticals: toxicity, stereotypical bias, machine ethics, truthfulness, and privacy. Our results demonstrate that RLHF on human preferences doesn't automatically guarantee trustworthiness, and reverse effects are often observed. Furthermore, we propose to adapt efficient influence function based data attribution methods to the RLHF setting to better understand the influence of fine-tuning data on individual trustworthiness benchmarks, and show its feasibility by providing our estimated attribution scores. Together, our results underscore the need for more nuanced approaches for model alignment from both the data and framework perspectives, and we hope this research will guide the community towards developing language models that are increasingly capable without sacrificing trustworthiness",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Manipulating objects with varying geometries and deformable objects is a major challenge in robotics. Tasks such as insertion with different objects or cloth hanging require precise control and effective modelling of complex dynamics. In this work, we frame this problem through the lens of a heterogeneous graph that comprises smaller sub-graphs, such as actuators and objects, accompanied by different edge types describing their interactions. This graph representation serves as a unified structure for both rigid and deformable objects tasks, and can be extended further to tasks comprising multiple actuators. To evaluate this setup, we present a novel and challenging reinforcement learning benchmark, including rigid insertion of diverse objects, as well as rope and cloth manipulation with multiple end-effectors. These tasks present a large search space, as both the initial and target configurations are uniformly sampled in 3D space. To address this issue, we propose a novel graph-based policy model, dubbed Heterogeneous Equivariant Policy (HEPi), utilizing $SE(3)$ equivariant message passing networks as the main backbone to exploit the geometric symmetry. In addition, by modeling explicit heterogeneity, HEPi can outperform Transformer-based and non-heterogeneous equivariant policies in terms of average returns, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen objects.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Topological deep learning (TDL) is a rapidly growing field that seeks to leverage topological structure in data and facilitate learning from data supported on topological objects, ranging from molecules to 3D shapes. Most TDL architectures can be unified under the framework of higher-order message-passing (HOMP), which generalizes graph message-passing to higher-order domains. In the first part of the paper, we explore HOMP's expressive power from a topological perspective, demonstrating the framework's inability to capture fundamental topological and metric invariants such as diameter, orientability, planarity, and homology. In addition, we demonstrate HOMP's limitations in fully leveraging lifting and pooling methods on graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the expressivity of TDL from a topological perspective. In the second part of the paper, we develop two new classes of architectures -- multi-cellular networks (MCN) and scalable MCN (SMCN) -- which draw inspiration from expressive GNNs. MCN can reach full expressivity, but scaling it to large data objects can be computationally expansive. Designed as a more scalable alternative, SMCN still mitigates many of HOMP's expressivity limitations. Finally, we design new benchmarks for evaluating models based on their ability to learn topological properties of complexes. We then evaluate SMCN on these benchmarks as well as on real-world graph datasets, demonstrating improvements over both HOMP baselines and expressive graph methods, highlighting the value of expressively leveraging topological information",

    "abstract": "With the introduction of video diffusion model, audio-conditioned human video generation has recently achieved significant breakthroughs in both the naturalness of motion and the synthesis of portrait details. Due to the limited control of audio signals in driving human motion, existing methods often add auxiliary spatial signals such as movement regions to stabilize movements, which compromise the naturalness and freedom of motion. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end audio-only conditioned video diffusion model named Loopy. Specifically, we designed two key modules: an inter- and intra-clip temporal module and an audio-to-latents module. These enable the model to better utilize long-term motion dependencies and establish a stronger audio-portrait movement correlation. Consequently, the model can generate more natural and stable portrait videos with subtle facial expressions, without the need for manually setting movement constraints. Extensive experiments show that Loopy outperforms recent audio-driven portrait diffusion models, delivering more lifelike and high-quality results across various scenarios.

While breakthroughs have been made in driving human animation through various modalities for portraits, most of current solutions for human body animation still focus on video-driven methods, leaving audio-driven taking body generation relatively underexplored. In this paper, we introduce CyberHost, a one-stage audio-driven talking body generation framework that addresses common synthesis degradations in half-body animation, including hand integrity, identity consistency, and natural motion. CyberHost's key designs are twofold. Firstly, the Region Attention Module (RAM) maintains a set of learnable, implicit, identity-agnostic latent features and combines them with identity-specific local visual features to enhance the synthesis of critical local regions. Secondly, the Human-Prior-Guided Conditions introduce more human structural priors into the model, reducing uncertainty in generated motion patterns and thereby improving the stability of the generated videos. To our knowledge, CyberHost is the first one-stage audio-driven human diffusion model capable of zero-shot video generation for the human body. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CyberHost surpasses previous works in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. CyberHost can also be extended to video-driven and audio-video hybrid-driven scenarios, achieving similarly satisfactory results",

Our experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16 patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models, reaping the benefits of both worlds",

To achieve this, we propose MoE++, a general and heterogeneous MoE framework that integrates both Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and zero-computation experts. Specifically, we introduce three types of zero-computation experts: the zero expert, copy expert, and constant expert, which correspond to discard, skip, and replace operations, respectively. This design offers three key advantages: (i) **Low Computing Overhead**: Unlike the uniform mixing mechanism for all tokens within vanilla MoE, MoE++ allows each token to engage with a dynamic number of FFNs, be adjusted by constant vectors, or even skip the MoE layer entirely. (ii) **High Performance**: By enabling simple tokens to utilize fewer FFN experts, MoE++ allows more experts to focus on challenging tokens, thereby unlocking greater performance potential than vanilla MoE. (iii) **Deployment Friendly**: Given that zero-computation experts have negligible parameters, we can deploy all zero-computation experts on each GPU, eliminating the significant communication overhead and expert load imbalance associated with FFN experts distributed across different GPUs. Moreover, we leverage gating residuals, enabling each token to consider the pathway taken in the previous layer when selecting the appropriate experts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MoE++ achieves better performance while delivering 1.1$\\sim$2.1$\\times$ expert forward throughput compared to a vanilla MoE model of the same size, which lays a solid foundation for developing advanced and efficient MoE-related models",

Since visual and textual concepts are naturally hierarchical, recent work has shown that hyperbolic space can serve as a high-potential manifold to learn vision-language representation with strong downstream performance. In this work, for the first time we show how to fully leverage the innate hierarchical nature of hyperbolic embeddings by looking beyond individual image-text pairs. We propose Compositional Entailment Learning for hyperbolic vision-language models. The idea is that an image is not only described by a sentence but is itself a composition of multiple object boxes, each with their own textual description. Such information can be obtained freely by extracting nouns from sentences and using openly available localized grounding models. We show how to hierarchically organize images, image boxes, and their textual descriptions through contrastive and entailment-based objectives. Empirical evaluation on a hyperbolic vision-language model trained with millions of image-text pairs shows that the proposed compositional learning approach outperforms conventional Euclidean CLIP learning, as well as recent hyperbolic alternatives, with better zero-shot and retrieval generalization and clearly stronger hierarchical performance",

We achieve this by aligning the advantages of interacting agents, increasing the probability of mutually beneficial actions when their interaction has been positive.

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based image generators are becoming unique methods for illumination harmonization and editing. The current bottleneck in scaling up the training of diffusion-based illumination editing models is mainly in the difficulty of preserving the underlying image details and maintaining intrinsic properties, such as albedos, unchanged. Without appropriate constraints, directly training the latest large image models with complex, varied, or in-the-wild data is likely to produce a structure-guided random image generator, rather than achieving the intended goal of precise illumination manipulation. We propose Imposing Consistent Light (IC-Light) transport during training, rooted in the physical principle that the linear blending of an object's appearances under different illumination conditions is consistent with its appearance under mixed illumination. This consistency allows for stable and scalable illumination learning, uniform handling of various data sources, and facilitates a physically grounded model behavior that modifies only the illumination of images while keeping other intrinsic properties unchanged. Based on this method, we can scale up the training of diffusion-based illumination editing models to large data quantities (> 10 million), across all available data types (real light stages, rendered samples, in-the-wild synthetic augmentations, etc), and using strong backbones (SDXL, Flux, etc). We also demonstrate that this approach reduces uncertainties and mitigates artifacts such as mismatched materials or altered albedos",

While effective, current studies have demonstrated that this perturbation inevitably disrupt the originally preserved knowledge within LLMs, especially in sequential editing scenarios. To address this, we introduce AlphaEdit, a novel solution that projects perturbation onto the null space of the preserved knowledge before applying it to the parameters. We theoretically prove that this projection ensures the output of post-edited LLMs remains unchanged when queried about the preserved knowledge, thereby mitigating the issue of disruption.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple language tasks, yet their safety guardrails can be circumvented, leading to harmful generations. In light of this, recent research on safety mechanisms has emerged, revealing that when safety representations or component are suppressed, the safety capability of LLMs are compromised. However, existing research tends to overlook the safety impact of multi-head attention mechanisms, despite their crucial role in various model functionalities. Hence, in this paper, we aim to explore the connection between standard attention mechanisms and safety capability to fill this gap in the safety-related mechanistic interpretability. We propose an novel metric which tailored for multi-head attention, the Safety Head ImPortant Score (Ships), to assess the individual heads' contributions to model safety. Base on this, we generalize Ships to the dataset level and further introduce the Safety Attention Head AttRibution Algorithm (Sahara) to attribute the critical safety attention heads inside the model. Our findings show that special attention head has a significant impact on safety. Ablating a single safety head allows aligned model (e.g., Llama-2-7b-chat) to respond to **16$\\times\\uparrow$** more harmful queries, while only modifying **0.006\\%** $\\downarrow$ of the parameters, in contrast to the $\\sim$ **5\\%** modification required in previous studies. More importantly, we demonstrate that attention heads primarily function as feature extractors for safety and models fine-tuned from the same base model exhibit overlapping safety heads through comprehensive experiments.

In supervised learning, this is usually used for predicting how the loss on a particular example would change. For diffusion models, we focus on predicting the change in the probability of generating a particular example via several proxy measurements. We show how to formulate influence functions for such quantities and how previously proposed methods can be interpreted as particular design choices in our framework. To ensure scalability of the Hessian computations in influence functions, we use a K-FAC approximation based on generalised Gauss-Newton matrices specifically tailored to diffusion models.

    "title": "Learning Distributions of Complex Fluid Simulations with Diffusion Graph Networks",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Physical systems with complex unsteady dynamics, such as fluid flows, are often poorly represented by a single mean solution. For many practical applications, it is crucial to access the full distribution of possible states, from which relevant statistics (e.g., RMS and two-point correlations) can be derived. Here, we propose a graph-based latent diffusion model that enables direct sampling of states from their equilibrium distribution, given a mesh discretization of the system and its physical parameters. This allows for the efficient computation of flow statistics without running long and expensive numerical simulations. The graph-based structure enables operations on unstructured meshes, which is critical for representing complex geometries with spatially localized high gradients, while latent-space diffusion modeling with a multi-scale GNN allows for efficient learning and inference of entire distributions of solutions. A key finding of our work is that the proposed networks can accurately learn full distributions even when trained on incomplete data from relatively short simulations. We apply this method to a range of fluid dynamics tasks, such as predicting pressure distributions on 3D wing models in turbulent flow, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging scenarios. The ability to directly sample accurate solutions, and capturing their diversity from short ground-truth simulations, is highly promising for complex scientific modeling tasks",

    "title": "Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Current methods for training self-correction typically depend on either multiple models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of supervision. To address these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT either suffers from a distribution mismatch between the training data and the model's own responses or implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at test time. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction strategy that is effective at test time as opposed to simply fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization prescribes running a first phase of RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse and then using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction during training. When applied to Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Creativity has long been considered one of the most difficult aspect of human intelligence for AI to mimic. However, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, has raised questions about whether AI can match or even surpass human creativity. We present CREATIVITY INDEX as the first step to quantify the linguistic creativity of a text by reconstructing it from existing text snippets on the web. CREATIVITY INDEX is motivated by the hypothesis that the seemingly remarkable creativity of LLMs may be attributable in large part to the creativity of human-written texts on the web. To compute CREATIVITY INDEX efficiently, we introduce DJ SEARCH, a novel dynamic programming algorithm that can search verbatim and near-verbatim matches of text snippets from a given document against the web. Experiments reveal that the CREATIVITY INDEX of professional human authors is on average 66.2% higher than that of LLMs, and that alignment reduces the CREATIVITY INDEX of LLMs by an average of 30.1%. In addition, we find that distinguished authors like Hemingway exhibit measurably higher CREATIVITY INDEX compared to other human writers. Finally, we demonstrate that CREATIVITY INDEX can be used as a surprisingly effective criterion for zero-shot machine text detection, surpassing the strongest existing zero-shot system, DetectGPT, by a significant margin of 30.2%, and even outperforming the strongest supervised system, GhostBuster, in five out of six domains",

Methods for quantifying geometric similarity in neural representations have become a popular tool for identifying computational principles that are potentially shared across neural systems.

Furthermore, these characteristics can have substantial influence on a system's computational capabilities. Here, we demonstrate that existing metrics can fail to capture key differences between neural systems with noisy dynamic responses. We then propose a metric for comparing the geometry of noisy neural trajectories, which can be derived as an optimal transport distance between Gaussian processes.

Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schrödinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development.

    "title": "Prioritized Generative Replay",

    "abstract": "Sample-efficient online reinforcement learning often uses replay buffers to store experience for reuse when updating the value function. However, uniform replay is inefficient, since certain classes of transitions can be more relevant to learning. While prioritization of more useful samples is helpful, this strategy can also lead to overfitting, as useful samples are likely to be more rare. In this work, we instead propose a prioritized, parametric version of an agent's memory, using generative models to capture online experience. This paradigm enables (1) densification of past experience, with new generations that benefit from the generative model's generalization capacity and (2) guidance via a family of ``relevance functions'' that push these generations towards more useful parts of an agent's acquired history. We show this recipe can be instantiated using conditional diffusion models and simple relevance functions such as curiosity- or value-based metrics. Our approach consistently improves performance and sample efficiency in both state- and pixel-based domains. We expose the mechanisms underlying these gains, showing how guidance promotes diversity in our generated transitions and reduces overfitting. We also showcase how our approach can train policies with even higher update-to-data ratios than before, opening up avenues to better scale online RL agents",

Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male, female}) as _directions_ in representation space. However, many natural concepts do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as _vectors_. This allows us to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+ hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet",

We show that Generator Matching unifies various generative modeling methods, including diffusion models, flow matching and discrete diffusion models. Furthermore, it expands the design space to new and unexplored Markov processes such as jump processes.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We introduce NoPoSplat, a feed-forward model capable of reconstructing 3D scenes parameterized by 3D Gaussians from unposed sparse multi-view images. Our model, trained exclusively with photometric loss, achieves real-time 3D Gaussian reconstruction during inference. To eliminate the need for accurate pose input during reconstruction, we anchor one input view's local camera coordinates as the canonical space and train the network to predict Gaussian primitives for all views within this space. This approach obviates the need to transform Gaussian primitives from local coordinates into a global coordinate system, thus avoiding errors associated with per-frame Gaussians and pose estimation. To resolve scale ambiguity, we design and compare various intrinsic embedding methods, ultimately opting to convert camera intrinsics into a token embedding and concatenate it with image tokens as input to the model, enabling accurate scene scale prediction. We utilize the reconstructed 3D Gaussians for novel view synthesis and pose estimation tasks and propose a two-stage coarse-to-fine pipeline for accurate pose estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our pose-free approach can achieve superior novel view synthesis quality compared to pose-required methods, particularly in scenarios with limited input image overlap. For pose estimation, our method, trained without ground truth depth or explicit matching loss, significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with substantial improvements. This work makes significant advances in pose-free generalizable 3D reconstruction and demonstrates its applicability to real-world scenarios.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently shown considerable potential in solving Bayesian inverse problems when used as priors. However, sampling from the resulting denoising posterior distributions remains a challenge as it involves intractable terms. To tackle this issue, state-of-the-art approaches formulate the problem as that of sampling from a surrogate diffusion model targeting the posterior and decompose its scores into two terms: the prior score and an intractable guidance term. While the former is replaced by the pre-trained score of the considered diffusion model, the guidance term has to be estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilises a decomposition of the transitions which, in contrast to previous methods, allows a trade-off between the complexity of the intractable guidance term and that of the prior transitions. We validate the proposed approach through extensive experiments on linear and nonlinear inverse problems, including challenging cases with latent diffusion models as priors, and demonstrate its effectiveness in reconstructing electrocardiogram (ECG) from partial measurements for accurate cardiac diagnosis",

However, it is still unclear, from a theoretical standpoint, why FixMatch-like SSL algorithms generalize better than SL on DNNs. In this work, we present the first theoretical justification for the enhanced test accuracy observed in FixMatch-like SSL applied to DNNs by taking convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on classification tasks as an example. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the semantic feature learning processes in FixMatch and SL are rather different. In particular, FixMatch learns all the discriminative features of each semantic class, while SL only randomly captures a subset of features due to the well-known lottery ticket hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that our analysis framework can be applied to other FixMatch-like SSL methods, e.g., FlexMatch, FreeMatch, Dash, and SoftMatch. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we develop an improved variant of FixMatch, termed Semantic-Aware FixMatch (SA-FixMatch).

It is accomplished through several key designs, including: 1) a monocular module that generates geometrically smooth and semantically meaningful segments known as 2D plane observations, 2) a plane-guided training procedure that implicitly learns accurate 3D geometry from the multi-view plane observations, and 3) a self-supervised feature field termed *Neural Coplanarity Field* that enables the modeling of scene semantics alongside the geometry.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context. This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context. Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache",

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions",

By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization.

While knowledge distillation is a solution, it still requires the original data, which is not always available due to copyrights and privacy concerns. For many users seeking open-vocabulary customization, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) emerges as a promising direction. Upon rethinking DFKD, we find that existing methods fail on CLIP due to their heavy reliance on BatchNorm layers, which are unexpectedly unusable in CLIP. Based on our findings, we adopt image-text matching to achieve DFKD for CLIP, enabling customization based on arbitrary class texts. This involves (i) inversing a surrogate dataset from CLIP based on text prompts; and (ii) distilling a student model from CLIP using the surrogate dataset. Specifically, we introduce style dictionary diversification to enhance the diversity of synthetic images. To prevent uncontrollable semantics introduced by diversification, we propose a class consistency maintaining strategy to ensure the consistency of synthetic images. Based on synthetic images with various styles, we further propose meta knowledge distillation to train the student model with good generalization ability. Moreover, we introduce a simple yet effective method to enable customization based on few example images.

We first propose that a reliable evaluation method should not uncritically rely on model preferences for pairwise evaluation, but rather assess the confidence of judge models and selectively decide when to trust its judgement. We then show that under this *selective evaluation* framework, human agreement can be provably guaranteed---such that the model evaluation aligns with that of humans to a user-specified agreement level. As part of our framework, we also introduce *Simulated Annotators*, a novel confidence estimation method that significantly improves judge calibration and thus enables high coverage of evaluated instances. Finally, we propose *Cascaded Selective Evaluation*, where we use cheaper models as initial judges and escalate to stronger models only when necessary---again, while still providing a provable guarantee of human agreement. Experimental results show that Cascaded Selective Evaluation guarantees strong alignment with humans, far beyond what LLM judges could achieve without selective evaluation. For example, on a subset of Chatbot Arena where GPT-4 almost never achieves 80% human agreement, our method, even while employing substantially cost-effective models such as Mistral-7B, *guarantees* over 80% human agreement with almost 80% test coverage",

Does this contradict their claim of generalists? To answer the question, we take a closer look at Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs. Our study shows that the expert routers in MoE LLMs can serve as an off-the-shelf embedding model with promising performance on a diverse class of embedding-focused tasks, without requiring any finetuning. Moreover, our extensive analysis shows that the MoE routing weights (RW) is complementary to the hidden state (HS) of LLMs, a widely-used embedding. Compared to HS, we find that RW is more robust to the choice of prompts and focuses on high-level semantics. Motivated by the analysis, we propose MoEE combining RW and HS, which achieves better performance than using either separately. Our exploration of their combination and prompting strategy shed several novel insights, e.g., a weighted sum of RW and HS similarities outperforms the similarity on their concatenation. Our experiments are conducted on 6 embedding tasks with 20 datasets from the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB).

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Significant advancements have been achieved in PDE modeling using neural fields. Despite their effectiveness, existing methods rely on global modulation, limiting their ability to reconstruct local details. While spatial modulation with vanilla grid-based representations offers a promising alternative, it struggles with inadequate global information modeling and over-fitting to the training spatial domain. To address these challenges, we propose GridMix, a novel approach that models spatial modulation as a mixture of grid-based representations. GridMix effectively explores global structures while preserving locality for fine-grained modulation. Furthermore, we introduce spatial domain augmentation to enhance the robustness of the modulated neural fields against spatial domain variations. With all these innovations, our comprehensive approach culminates in MARBLE, a framework that significantly advancing the capabilities of neural fields in PDE modeling. The effectiveness of MARBLE is extensively validated on diverse benchmarks encompassing dynamics modeling and geometric prediction",

We formulate data selection as a generalized Optimal Control problem, which can be solved theoretically by Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP), yielding a set of necessary conditions that characterize the relationship between optimal data selection and LM training dynamics. Based on these theoretical results, we introduce **P**MP-based **D**ata **S**election (**PDS**), a framework that approximates optimal data selection by solving the PMP conditions. In our experiments, we adopt PDS to select data from CommmonCrawl and show that the PDS-selected corpus accelerates the learning of LMs and constantly boosts their performance on a wide range of downstream tasks across various model sizes. Moreover, the benefits of PDS extend to ~400B models trained on ~10T tokens, as evidenced by the extrapolation of the test loss curves according to the Scaling Laws. PDS also improves data utilization when the pre-training data is limited, by reducing the data demand by 1.8 times, which helps mitigate the quick exhaustion of available web-crawled corpora.

    "abstract": "Consistency models (CMs) are a powerful class of diffusion-based generative models optimized for fast sampling. Most existing CMs are trained using discretized timesteps, which introduce additional hyperparameters and are prone to discretization errors. While continuous-time formulations can mitigate these issues, their success has been limited by training instability. To address this, we propose a simplified theoretical framework that unifies previous parameterizations of diffusion models and CMs, identifying the root causes of instability. Based on this analysis, we introduce key improvements in diffusion process parameterization, network architecture, and training objectives. These changes enable us to train continuous-time CMs at an unprecedented scale, reaching 1.5B parameters on ImageNet 512×512. Our proposed training algorithm, using only two sampling steps, achieves FID scores of 2.06 on CIFAR-10, 1.48 on ImageNet 64×64, and 1.88 on ImageNet 512×512, narrowing the gap in FID scores with the best existing diffusion models to within 10\\%",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across multimodal tasks such as visual perception and reasoning, leading to good performance on various multimodal evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks keep a static nature and overlap with the pre-training data, resulting in fixed complexity constraints and data contamination issues. This raises the concern regarding the validity of the evaluation. To address these two challenges, we introduce a dynamic multimodal evaluation protocol called Vision-Language Bootstrapping (VLB). VLB provides a robust and comprehensive assessment for LVLMs with reduced data contamination and flexible complexity. To this end, VLB dynamically generates new visual question-answering samples through a multimodal bootstrapping module that modifies both images and language, while ensuring that newly generated samples remain consistent with the original ones by a judge module. By composing various bootstrapping strategies, VLB offers dynamic variants of existing benchmarks with diverse complexities, enabling the evaluation to co-evolve with the ever-evolving capabilities of LVLMs. Extensive experimental results across multiple benchmarks, including SEEDBench, MMBench, and MME, show that VLB significantly reduces data contamination and exposes performance limitations of LVLMs",

We explore a framework where the model verifies its own outputs, filters or reweights data based on this verification, and distills the filtered data. Despite several empirical successes, a fundamental understanding is still lacking. In this work, we initiate a comprehensive, modular and controlled study on LLM self-improvement. We provide a mathematical formulation for self-improvement, which is largely governed by a quantity which we formalize as the **generation-verification gap**. Through experiments with various model families and tasks, we discover a scaling phenomenon of self-improvement -- a variant of the generation-verification gap scales monotonically with the model pre-training flops. We also examine when self-improvement is possible, an iterative self-improvement procedure, and ways to improve its performance. Our findings not only advance understanding of LLM self-improvement with practical implications, but also open numerous avenues for future research into its capabilities and boundaries",

Sana can synthesize high-resolution, high-quality images with strong text-image alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on laptop GPU. Core designs include: (1) Deep compression autoencoder: unlike traditional AEs, which compress images only 8$\\times$, we trained an AE that can compress images 32$\\times$, effectively reducing the number of latent tokens. (2) Linear DiT: we replace all vanilla attention in DiT with linear attention, which is more efficient at high resolutions without sacrificing quality. (3) Decoder-only text encoder: we replaced T5 with modern decoder-only small LLM as the text encoder and designed complex human instruction with in-context learning to enhance the image-text alignment. (4) Efficient training and sampling: we propose Flow-DPM-Solver to reduce sampling steps, with efficient caption labeling and selection to accelerate convergence. As a result, Sana-0.6B is very competitive with modern giant diffusion model (e.g. Flux-12B), being 20 times smaller and 100+ times faster in measured throughput. Moreover, Sana-0.6B can be deployed on a 16GB laptop GPU, taking less than 1 second to generate a 1024$\\times$1024 resolution image. Sana enables content creation at low cost.

Our analysis suggests a new MISL method (contrastive successor features) that retains the excellent performance of METRA with fewer moving parts, and highlights connections between skill learning, contrastive representation learning, and successor features.

    "title": "When Selection Meets Intervention: Additional Complexities in Causal Discovery",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We address the common yet often-overlooked selection bias in interventional studies, where subjects are selectively enrolled into experiments. For instance, participants in a drug trial are usually patients of the relevant disease; A/B tests on mobile applications target existing users only, and gene perturbation studies typically focus on specific cell types, such as cancer cells. Ignoring this bias leads to incorrect causal discovery results. Even when recognized, the existing paradigm for interventional causal discovery still fails to address it. This is because subtle differences in _when_ and _where_ interventions happen can lead to significantly different statistical patterns. We capture this dynamic by introducing a graphical model that explicitly accounts for both the observed world (where interventions are applied) and the counterfactual world (where selection occurs while interventions have not been applied). We characterize the Markov property of the model, and propose a provably sound algorithm to identify causal relations as well as selection mechanisms up to the equivalence class, from data with soft interventions and unknown targets. Through synthetic and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm effectively identifies true causal relations despite the presence of selection bias",

    "title": "LVSM: A Large View Synthesis Model with Minimal 3D Inductive Bias",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "We propose the Large View Synthesis Model (LVSM), a novel transformer-based approach for scalable and generalizable novel view synthesis from sparse-view inputs. We introduce two architectures: (1) an encoder-decoder LVSM, which encodes input image tokens into a fixed number of 1D latent tokens, functioning as a fully learned scene representation, and decodes novel-view images from them; and (2) a decoder-only LVSM, which directly maps input images to novel-view outputs, completely eliminating intermediate scene representations. Both models bypass the 3D inductive biases used in previous methods---from 3D representations (e.g., NeRF, 3DGS) to network designs (e.g., epipolar projections, plane sweeps)---addressing novel view synthesis with a fully data-driven approach. While the encoder-decoder model offers faster inference due to its independent latent representation, the decoder-only LVSM achieves superior quality, scalability, and zero-shot generalization, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 1.5 to 3.5 dB PSNR. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate that both LVSM variants achieve state-of-the-art novel view synthesis quality, delivering superior performance even with reduced computational resources (1-2 GPUs).

In this work, we aim to take a holistic approach to the construction of discrete generative models based on continuous-time Markov chains, and for the first time, allow the use of arbitrary discrete probability paths, or colloquially, corruption processes. Through the lens of optimizing the symmetric kinetic energy, we propose velocity formulas that can be applied to any given probability path, completely decoupling the probability and velocity, and giving the user the freedom to specify any desirable probability path based on expert knowledge specific to the data domain. Furthermore, we find that a special construction of mixture probability paths optimizes the symmetric kinetic energy for the discrete case. We empirically validate the usefulness of this new design space across multiple modalities: text generation, inorganic material generation, and image generation. We find that we can outperform the mask construction even in text with kinetic-optimal mixture paths, while we can make use of domain-specific constructions of the probability path over the visual domain",

    "title": "Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "As language models grow ever larger, so do their vocabularies. This has shifted the memory footprint of LLMs during training disproportionately to one single layer: the cross-entropy in the loss computation. Cross-entropy builds up a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary items and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than the rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that computes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens into global memory. Rather, CCE only computes the logit for the correct token and evaluates the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly. We implement a custom kernel that performs the matrix multiplications and the log-sum-exp reduction over the vocabulary in flash memory, making global memory consumption for the cross-entropy computation negligible. This has a dramatic effect. Taking the Gemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss computation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption of the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB. To improve the throughput of CCE, we leverage the inherent sparsity of softmax and propose to skip elements of the gradient computation that have a negligible (i.e. below numerical precision) contribution to the gradient. Experiments demonstrate that the dramatic reduction in memory consumption is accomplished without sacrificing training speed or convergence",

To address this challenge, we reformulate workflow optimization as a search problem over code-represented workflows, where LLM-invoking nodes are connected by edges. We introduce AFLOW, an automated framework that efficiently explores this space using Monte Carlo Tree Search, iteratively refining workflows through code modification, tree-structured experience, and execution feedback. Empirical evaluations across six benchmark datasets demonstrate AFLOW's efficacy, yielding a 5.7% average improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs), like CLIP, have gained popularity for their versatile applicability to various downstream tasks. Despite their successes in some tasks, like zero-shot object recognition, they perform surprisingly poor on other tasks, like attribute recognition. Previous work has attributed these challenges to the modality gap, a separation of image and text in the shared representation space, and to a bias towards objects over other factors, such as attributes. In this analysis paper, we investigate both phenomena thoroughly. We evaluated off-the-shelf VLMs and while the gap's influence on performance is typically overshadowed by other factors, we find indications that closing the gap indeed leads to improvements. Moreover, we find that, contrary to intuition, only few embedding dimensions drive the gap and that the embedding spaces are differently organized. To allow for a clean study of object bias, we introduce a definition and a corresponding measure of it. Equipped with this tool, we find that object bias does not lead to worse performance on other concepts, such as attributes per se. However, why do both phenomena, modality gap and object bias, emerge in the first place? To answer this fundamental question and uncover some of the inner workings of contrastive VLMs, we conducted experiments that allowed us to control the amount of shared information between the modalities. These experiments revealed that the driving factor behind both the modality gap and the object bias, is an information imbalance between images and captions, and unveiled an intriguing connection between the modality gap and entropy of the logits",

In this paper, we introduce FlexPrefill, a Flexible sparse Pre-filling mechanism that dynamically adjusts sparse attention patterns and computational budget in real-time to meet the specific requirements of each input and attention head. The flexibility of our method is demonstrated through two key innovations: 1) Query-Aware Sparse Pattern Determination: By measuring Jensen-Shannon divergence, this component adaptively switches between query-specific diverse attention patterns and predefined attention patterns. 2) Cumulative-Attention Based Index Selection: This component dynamically selects query-key indexes to be computed based on different attention patterns, ensuring the sum of attention scores meets a predefined threshold. FlexPrefill adaptively optimizes the sparse pattern and sparse ratio of each attention head based on the prompt, enhancing efficiency in long-sequence inference tasks. Experimental results show significant improvements in both speed and accuracy over prior methods, providing a more flexible and efficient solution for LLM inference",

Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and metrics in providing a comprehensive evaluation of interleaved LVLMs. Specifically, we evaluate eight LVLMs, revealing that even the best models show significant room for improvement, with most achieving only moderate results.

However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and group-think in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalize its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced persona and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems. Our benchmark and code are available at BenchForm",

In order to attenuate the negative impact of harmful perturbation, we propose an alignment-stage solution, dubbed Booster. Technically, along with the original alignment loss, we append a loss regularizer in the alignment stage's optimization. The regularizer ensures that the model's harmful loss reduction after the simulated harmful perturbation is attenuated, thereby mitigating the subsequent fine-tuning risk.

    "abstract": "Gradient-based interpretations often require an anchor point of comparison to avoid saturation in computing feature importance. We show that current baselines defined using static functions—constant mapping, averaging or blurring—inject harmful colour, texture or frequency assumptions that deviate from model behaviour. This leads to accumulation of irregular gradients, resulting in attribution maps that are biased, fragile and manipulable. Departing from the static approach, we propose $\\texttt{UNI}$ to compute an (un)learnable, debiased and adaptive baseline by perturbing the input towards an $\\textit{unlearning direction}$ of steepest ascent. Our method discovers reliable baselines and succeeds in erasing salient features, which in turn locally smooths the high-curvature decision boundaries. Our analyses point to unlearning as a promising avenue for generating faithful, efficient and robust interpretations",

    "abstract": "Automatic chart understanding is crucial for content comprehension and document parsing. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in chart understanding through domain-specific alignment and fine-tuning. However, current MLLMs still struggle to provide faithful data and reliable analysis only based on charts. To address it, we propose ChartMoE, which employs the Mixture of Expert (MoE) architecture to replace the traditional linear projector to bridge the modality gap. Specifically, we train several linear connectors through distinct alignment tasks, which are utilized as the foundational initialization parameters for different experts. Additionally, we introduce ChartMoE-Align, a dataset with nearly 1 million chart-table-JSON-code quadruples to conduct three alignment tasks (chart-table/JSON/code). Combined with the vanilla connector, we initialize different experts diversely and adopt high-quality knowledge learning to further refine the MoE connector and LLM parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the MoE connector and our initialization strategy, e.g., ChartMoE improves the accuracy of the previous state-of-the-art from 80.48% to 84.64% on the ChartQA benchmark",

    "title": "Probabilistic Learning to Defer: Handling Missing Expert Annotations and Controlling Workload Distribution",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Recent progress in machine learning research is gradually shifting its focus towards *human-AI cooperation* due to the advantages of exploiting the reliability of human experts and the efficiency of AI models. One of the promising approaches in human-AI cooperation is *learning to defer* (L2D), where the system analyses the input data and decides to make its own decision or defer to human experts. Although L2D has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, in its standard setting, L2D entails a severe limitation: all human experts must annotate the whole training dataset of interest, resulting in a time-consuming and expensive annotation process that can subsequently influence the size and diversity of the training set. Moreover, the current L2D does not have a principled way to control workload distribution among human experts and the AI classifier, which is critical to optimise resource allocation. We, therefore, propose a new probabilistic modelling approach inspired by the mixture-of-experts, where the Expectation - Maximisation algorithm is leverage to address the issue of missing expert's annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a constraint, which can be solved efficiently during the E-step, to control the workload distribution among human experts and the AI classifier. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that our proposed probabilistic approach performs competitively, or surpasses previously proposed methods assessed on the same benchmarks",

    "title": "Knowing Your Target: Target-Aware Transformer Makes Better Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding",
    "volume": "oral",
    "abstract": "Transformer has attracted increasing interest in spatio-temporal video grounding, or STVG, owing to its end-to-end pipeline and promising result. Existing Transformer-based STVG approaches often leverage a set of object queries, which are initialized simply using zeros and then gradually learn target position information via iterative interactions with multimodal features, for spatial and temporal localization. Despite simplicity, these zero object queries, due to lacking target-specific cues, are hard to learn discriminative target information from interactions with multimodal features in complicated scenarios (e.g., with distractors or occlusion), resulting in degradation. Addressing this, we introduce a novel $\\textbf{T}$arget-$\\textbf{A}$ware Transformer for $\\textbf{STVG}$ ($\\textbf{TA-STVG}$), which seeks to adaptively generate object queries via exploring target-specific cues from the given video-text pair, for improving STVG. The key lies in two simple yet effective modules, comprising text-guided temporal sampling (TTS) and attribute-aware spatial activation (ASA), working in a cascade. The former focuses on selecting target-relevant temporal cues from a video utilizing holistic text information, while the latter aims at further exploiting the fine-grained visual attribute information of the object from previous target-aware temporal cues, which is applied for object query initialization. Compared to existing methods leveraging zero-initialized queries, object queries in our TA-STVG, directly generated from a given video-text pair, naturally carry target-specific cues, making them adaptive and better interact with multimodal features for learning more discriminative information to improve STVG. In our experiments on three benchmarks, including HCSTVG-v1/-v2 and VidSTG, TA-STVG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms the baseline, validating its efficacy. Moreover, TTS and ASA are designed for general purpose. When applied to existing methods such as TubeDETR and STCAT, we show substantial performance gains, verifying its generality.

The foundation of our approach is to build a $\\textit{long short-term world model}$. To achieve this, we simulate goal-conditioned jumpy state transitions and compute corresponding affordance maps by zooming in on specific areas within single images.

    "abstract": "It is a mystery how the brain decodes color vision purely from the optic nerve signals it receives, with a core inferential challenge being how it disentangles internal perception with the correct color dimensionality from the unknown encoding properties of the eye. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework for modeling this emergence of human color vision by simulating both the eye and the cortex. Existing research often overlooks how the cortex develops color vision or represents color space internally, assuming that the color dimensionality is known a priori; however, we argue that the visual cortex has the capability and the challenge of inferring the color dimensionality purely from fluctuations in the optic nerve signals. To validate our theory, we introduce a simulation engine for biological eyes based on established vision science and generate optic nerve signals resulting from looking at natural images. Further, we propose a bio-plausible model of cortical learning based on self-supervised prediction of optic nerve signal fluctuations under natural eye motions. We show that this model naturally learns to generate color vision by disentangling retinal invariants from the sensory signals. When the retina contains $N$ types of color photoreceptors, our simulation shows that $N$-dimensional color vision naturally emerges, verified through formal colorimetry. Using this framework, we also present the first simulation work that successfully boosts the color dimensionality, as observed in gene therapy on squirrel monkeys, and demonstrates the possibility of enhancing human color vision from 3D to 4D",

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in reasoning and task planning for embodied agents, their ability to comprehend physical phenomena remains extremely limited. To close this gap, we introduce PhysBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' physical world understanding capability across a diverse set of tasks. PhysBench contains 10,002 entries of interleaved video-image-text data, categorized into four major domains: physical object properties, physical object relationships, physical scene understanding, and physics-based dynamics, further divided into 19 subclasses and 8 distinct capability dimensions. Our extensive experiments, conducted on 75 representative VLMs, reveal that while these models excel in common-sense reasoning, they struggle with understanding the physical world---likely due to the absence of physical knowledge in their training data and the lack of embedded physical priors. To tackle the shortfall, we introduce PhysAgent, a novel framework that combines the generalization strengths of VLMs with the specialized expertise of vision models, significantly enhancing VLMs' physical understanding across a variety of tasks, including an 18.4\\% improvement on GPT-4o. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that enhancing VLMs' physical world understanding capabilities can help embodied agents such as MOKA.

    "title": "How new data permeates LLM knowledge and how to dilute it",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large language models continually learn through the accumulation of gradient-based updates, but how individual pieces of new information affect existing knowledge, leading to both beneficial generalization and problematic hallucination, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that when learning new information, LLMs exhibit a \"priming\" effect: learning a new fact can cause the model to inappropriately apply that knowledge in unrelated contexts. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce \"Outlandish,\" a carefully curated dataset of 1320 diverse text samples designed to probe how new knowledge permeates through an LLM's existing knowledge base. Using this dataset, we show that the degree of priming after learning new information can be predicted by measuring the token probability of key words before training. This relationship holds robustly across different model architectures (PALM-2, Gemma, Llama), sizes, and training stages. Finally, we develop two novel techniques to modulate how new knowledge affects existing model behavior: (1) a ``stepping-stone'' text augmentation strategy and (2) an ``ignore-k'' update pruning method. These approaches reduce undesirable priming effects by 50-95% while preserving the model's ability to learn new information. Our findings provide both empirical insights into how LLMs learn and practical tools for improving the specificity of knowledge insertion in language models.

Following the derived guidelines, we propose UniCBE, a unified uniformity-driven CBE framework which simultaneously optimize these core objectives by constructing and integrating three decoupled sampling probability matrices, each designed to ensure uniformity in specific aspects. We further ablate the optimal tuple sampling and preference aggregation strategies to achieve efficient CBE. On the AlpacaEval benchmark, UniCBE saves over 17% of evaluation budgets while achieving a Pearson correlation with ground truth exceeding 0.995, demonstrating excellent accuracy and convergence. In scenarios where new models are continuously introduced, UniCBE can even save over 50% of evaluation costs, highlighting its improved scalability",

In a nutshell, an MoE model consists of multiple experts in each model layer and routes the training tokens to only a fixed number of experts rather than all. In distributed training, as experts are distributed among different GPUs, All-to-All communication is necessary to exchange the training tokens among the GPUs after each time of expert routing. Due to the frequent and voluminous data exchanges, All-to-All communication has become a notable challenge to training efficiency. In this paper, we manage to accelerate All-to-All communication in MoE models from the training sample perspective, which is unexplored so far. In particular, we put forward the observation that tokens in the same training sample have certain levels of locality in expert routing. Motivated by this, we develop NetMoE, which takes such locality into account and dynamically rearranges the placement of training samples to minimize All-to-All communication costs. Specifically, we model the All-to-All communication given the sample placement and formulate an integer programming problem to deduce the optimal placement in polynomial time. Experiments with 32 GPUs show that NetMoE achieves a maximum efficiency improvement of $1.67 \\times$ compared with current MoE training frameworks",

    "abstract": "Advances in machine learning research drive progress in real-world applications. To ensure this progress, it is important to understand the potential pitfalls on the way from a novel method's success on academic benchmarks to its practical deployment. In this work, we analyze existing tabular deep learning benchmarks and find two common characteristics of tabular data in typical industrial applications that are underrepresented in the datasets usually used for evaluation in the literature. First, in real-world deployment scenarios, distribution of data often changes over time. To account for this distribution drift, time-based train/test splits should be used in evaluation. However, existing academic tabular datasets often lack timestamp metadata to enable such evaluation. Second, a considerable portion of datasets in production settings stem from extensive data acquisition and feature engineering pipelines. This can have an impact on the absolute and relative number of predictive, uninformative, and correlated features compared to academic datasets. In this work, we aim to understand how recent research advances in tabular deep learning transfer to these underrepresented conditions. To this end, we introduce TabReD -- a collection of eight industry-grade tabular datasets. We reassess a large number of tabular ML models and techniques on TabReD. We demonstrate that evaluation on both time-based data splits and richer feature sets leads to different methods ranking, compared to evaluation on random splits and smaller number of features, which are common in academic benchmarks.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The human brain utilizes spikes for information transmission and dynamically reorganizes its network structure to boost energy efficiency and cognitive capabilities throughout its lifespan. Drawing inspiration from this spike-based computation, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed to construct event-driven models that emulate this efficiency. Despite these advances, deep SNNs continue to suffer from over-parameterization during training and inference, a stark contrast to the brain's ability to self-organize. Furthermore, existing sparse SNNs are challenged by maintaining optimal pruning levels due to a static pruning ratio, resulting in either under or over-pruning. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage dynamic structure learning approach for deep SNNs, aimed at maintaining effective sparse training from scratch while optimizing compression efficiency. The first stage evaluates the compressibility of existing sparse subnetworks within SNNs using the PQ index, which facilitates an adaptive determination of the rewiring ratio for synaptic connections based on data compression insights. In the second stage, this rewiring ratio critically informs the dynamic synaptic connection rewiring process, including both pruning and regrowth. This approach significantly improves the exploration of sparse structures training in deep SNNs, adapting sparsity dynamically from the point view of compression efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that this sparse training approach not only aligns with the performance of current deep SNNs models but also significantly improves the efficiency of compressing sparse SNNs. Crucially, it preserves the advantages of initiating training with sparse models and offers a promising solution for implementing Edge AI on neuromorphic hardware",

To address this problem, we propose to fine-tune LLMs as scalable judges (JudgeLM) to evaluate LLMs efficiently and effectively in open-ended benchmarks. We first propose a comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality dataset containing task seeds, LLMs-generated answers, and GPT-4-generated judgments for fine-tuning high-performance judges, as well as a new benchmark for evaluating the judges. We train JudgeLM at different scales from 7B, 13B, to 33B parameters, and conduct a systematic analysis of its capabilities and behaviors. We then analyze the key biases in fine-tuning LLM as a judge and consider them as position bias, knowledge bias, and format bias. To address these issues, JudgeLM introduces a bag of techniques including swap augmentation, reference support, and reference drop, which clearly enhance the judge's performance.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized motion generation models in embodied applications such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. While LLM-type auto-regressive motion generation models benefit from training scalability, there remains a discrepancy between their token prediction objectives and human preferences. As a result, models pre-trained solely with token-prediction objectives often generate behaviors that deviate from what humans would prefer, making post-training preference alignment crucial for producing human-preferred motions. Unfortunately, post-training alignment requires extensive preference rankings of motions generated by the pre-trained model, which are costly and time-consuming to annotate, especially in multi-agent motion generation settings. Recently, there has been growing interest in leveraging expert demonstrations previously used during pre-training to scalably generate preference data for post-training alignment. However, these methods often adopt an adversarial assumption, treating all pre-trained model-generated samples as unpreferred examples and relying solely on pre-training expert demonstrations to construct preferred examples. This adversarial approach overlooks the valuable signal provided by preference rankings among the model's own generations, ultimately reducing alignment effectiveness and potentially leading to misaligned behaviors. In this work, instead of treating all generated samples as equally bad, we propose a principled approach that leverages implicit preferences encoded in pre-training expert demonstrations to construct preference rankings among the pre-trained model's generations, offering more nuanced preference alignment guidance with zero human cost. We apply our approach to large-scale traffic simulation (more than 100 agents) and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the realism of pre-trained model's generated behaviors, making a lightweight 1M motion generation model comparable to state-of-the-art large imitation-based models by relying solely on implicit feedback from pre-training demonstrations, without requiring additional post-training human preference annotations or incurring high computational costs. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of preference data scaling laws and their effects on over-optimization, offering valuable insights for future studies",

    "title": "Online Preference Alignment for Language Models via Count-based Exploration",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown great potential in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to align with human preferences. Existing methods perform preference alignment from a fixed dataset, which can be limited in data coverage and the resulting reward model is hard to generalize in out-of-distribution responses. Thus, online RLHF is more desirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial dataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we study the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e., how to explore for LLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that an optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a provably efficient RLHF policy. Then, we reformulate our objective to direct preference optimization with an exploration term, where the UCB-term can be converted to a count-based exploration bonus. We further propose a practical algorithm, named Count-based Online Preference Optimization (COPO), which leverages a simple coin-flip counting module to estimate the pseudo-count of a prompt-response pair in previously collected data. COPO encourages LLMs to balance exploration and preference optimization in an iterative manner, which enlarges the exploration space and the entire data coverage of iterative LLM policies. We conduct online RLHF experiments on Zephyr and Llama-3 models. The results on instruction-following and standard academic benchmarks show that COPO significantly increases performance",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of highly capable autonomous agents. However, existing multi-agent frameworks often struggle with integrating diverse capable third-party agents due to reliance on agents defined within their own ecosystems. They also face challenges in simulating distributed environments, as most frameworks are limited to single-device setups. Furthermore, these frameworks often rely on hard-coded communication pipelines, limiting their adaptability to dynamic task requirements. Inspired by the concept of the Internet, we propose the Internet of Agents (IoA), a novel framework that addresses these limitations by providing a flexible and scalable platform for LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. IoA introduces an agent integration protocol, an instant-messaging-like architecture design, and dynamic mechanisms for agent teaming and conversation flow control. Through extensive experiments on general assistant tasks, embodied AI tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation benchmarks, we demonstrate that IoA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing its ability to facilitate effective collaboration among heterogeneous agents. IoA represents a step towards linking diverse agents in an Internet-like environment, where agents can seamlessly collaborate to achieve greater intelligence and capabilities. We will release our code to facilitate further research",

    "title": "Rewarding Progress: Scaling Automated Process Verifiers for LLM Reasoning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "A promising approach for improving reasoning in large language models is to use process reward models (PRMs). PRMs provide feedback at each step of a multi-step reasoning trace, improving credit assignment over outcome reward models (ORMs) that only provide feedback at the final step. However, collecting dense, per-step human labels is not scalable, and training PRMs from automatically-labeled data has thus far led to limited gains. With the goal of using PRMs to improve a *base* policy via test-time search and reinforcement learning (RL), we ask: ``How should we design process rewards?'' Our key insight is that, to be effective, the process reward for a step should measure *progress*: a change in the likelihood of producing a correct response in the future, before and after taking the step, as measured under a *prover* policy distinct from the base policy. Such progress values can {distinguish} good and bad steps generated by the base policy, even though the base policy itself cannot. Theoretically, we show that even weaker provers can improve the base policy, as long as they distinguish steps without being too misaligned with the base policy. Our results show that process rewards defined as progress under such provers improve the efficiency of exploration during test-time search and online RL. We empirically validate our claims by training **process advantage verifiers (PAVs)** to measure progress under such provers and show that compared to ORM, they are >8% more accurate, and 1.5-5x more compute-efficient. Equipped with these insights, our PAVs enable **one of the first results** showing a 6x gain in sample efficiency for a policy trained using online RL with PRMs vs. ORMs",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) can give out erroneous answers to factually rooted questions either as a result of undesired training outcomes or simply because the world has moved on after a certain knowledge cutoff date. Under such scenarios, *knowledge editing* often comes to the rescue by delivering efficient patches for such erroneous answers without significantly altering the rest, where many editing methods have seen reasonable success when the editing targets are simple and direct (e.g., *``what club does Lionel Messi currently play for?''*). However, knowledge fragments like this are often deeply intertwined in the real world, making effectively propagating the editing effect to non-directly related questions a practical challenge (to entertain an extreme example: [*\"What car did the wife of the owner of the club that Messi currently plays for used to get to school in the 80s?\"*](youtube.com/watch?v=DbwiHC1Fu-E\\&t=132s)). Prior arts have coined this task as *multi-hop knowledge editing* with the most popular dataset being MQuAKE, serving as the sole evaluation benchmark for many later proposed editing methods due to the expensive nature of constructing knowledge editing datasets at scale. In this work, we reveal that **up to 33\\% or 76\\% of \\mquake{}'s questions and ground truth labels are, in fact, corrupted in various fashions due to some unintentional clerical or procedural oversights**. Our work provides a detailed audit of MQuAKE's error pattern and a comprehensive fix without sacrificing its dataset capacity. Additionally, we benchmarked almost all proposed MQuAKE-evaluated editing methods on our post-fix dataset, **MQuAKE-Remastered**. We observe that many methods try to overfit the original MQuAKE by exploiting some dataset idiosyncrasies of MQuAKE. We provide a guideline on how to approach such datasets faithfully and show that a simple, minimally invasive approach — **GWalk** — can offer beyond SOTA editing performance without such exploitation.

    "abstract": "In-Context Learning (ICL) has significantly expanded the general-purpose nature of large language models, allowing them to adapt to novel tasks using merely the inputted context. This has motivated a series of papers that analyze tractable synthetic domains and postulate precise mechanisms that may underlie ICL. However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence modeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from such studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling task that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As we show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL, hence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this setup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into four broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach with either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms engage in a competitive dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise experimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others: e.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at times sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior, revealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense, we argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with its own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability. This also implies that making general claims about ICL that hold universally across all settings may be infeasible",

We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present \\textit{Latent Macro Action Planner} (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces",

Researchers have recently proposed a few methods based either on the Schroedinger Bridge or Flow Matching to tackle this problem, but these approaches remain limited in their ability to effectively combine data from multiple time points and different experimental settings. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios where observations from certain combinations of time points and experimental conditions are missing, either because of experimental costs or sensory failure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method named Multi-Marginal Flow Matching (MMFM). MMFM first constructs a flow using smooth spline-based interpolation across time points and conditions and regresses it with a neural network using the classifier-free guided Flow Matching framework. This framework allows for the sharing of contextual information about the dynamics across multiple trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including a recent single-cell genomics data set with around a hundred chemical perturbations across time points.

    "abstract": "Aligning to human preferences and/or intentions is an important requirement for contemporary foundation models. To ensure alignment, popular approaches such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) break down the task into three stages: (i) a model is computed with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) based upon large demonstrations data, (ii) a reward model (RM) is estimated based upon human feedback data, and (iii) reinforcement learning (RL) is used to further refine the SFT model by optimizing the estimated reward model. Demonstrations and human feedback data reflect human user preferences in different ways. As a result, the reward model estimate obtained from only human feedback data is likely not as accurate as a reward model estimate obtained from both demonstration and human feedback data. A policy model that optimizes the reward model estimate obtained from both demonstration and human feedback data will likely exhibit better alignment performance. We introduce a tractable algorithm for finding the reward and policy models and provide a finite-time performance guarantee. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution with extensive experiments including alignment problems in LLMs and robotic control problems in MuJoCo. We observe that the proposed solutions outperform the existing alignment algorithm by large margins, especially when the amounts of demonstration and preference data are unbalanced",

We resolve this by introducing a formal definition of realizability, the ability to draw samples from a distribution, and then developing a complete algorithm to determine whether an arbitrary counterfactual distribution is realizable given fundamental physical constraints, such as the inability to go back in time and subject the same unit to a different experimental condition. We illustrate the implications of this new framework for counterfactual data collection using motivating examples from causal fairness and causal reinforcement learning. While the baseline approach in these motivating settings typically follows an interventional or observational strategy, we show that a counterfactual strategy provably dominates both",

DAG generative models facilitate the creation of synthetic DAGs, which can be used for benchmarking computing systems while preserving intellectual property. However, generating realistic DAGs is challenging due to their inherent directional and logical dependencies. This paper introduces LayerDAG, an autoregressive diffusion model, to address these challenges. LayerDAG decouples the strong node dependencies into manageable units that can be processed sequentially. By interpreting the partial order of nodes as a sequence of bipartite graphs, LayerDAG leverages autoregressive generation to model directional dependencies and employs diffusion models to capture logical dependencies within each bipartite graph. Comparative analyses demonstrate that LayerDAG outperforms existing DAG generative models in both expressiveness and generalization, particularly for generating large-scale DAGs with up to 400 nodes—a critical scenario for system benchmarking. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world flow graphs from various computing platforms show that LayerDAG generates valid DAGs with superior statistical properties and benchmarking performance. The synthetic DAGs generated by LayerDAG enhance the training of ML-based surrogate models, resulting in improved accuracy in predicting performance metrics of real-world DAGs across diverse computing platforms",

Each dilemma presents two possible actions, along with affected parties and relevant human values for each action. Based on these dilemmas, we gather a repository of human values covering diverse everyday topics, such as interpersonal relationships, workplace, and environmental issues. With DailyDilemmas, we evaluate LLMs on these dilemmas to determine what action they will choose and the values represented by these action choices.

For instance, we find LLMs are most aligned with self-expression over survival in World Values Survey and care over loyalty in Moral Foundations Theory. Interestingly, we find substantial preference differences in models for some core values. For example, for truthfulness, Mixtral-8x7B neglects it by 9.7% while GPT-4-turbo selects it by 9.4%. We also study the recent guidance released by OpenAI (ModelSpec), and Anthropic (Constitutional AI) to understand how their designated principles reflect their models' actual value prioritization when facing nuanced moral reasoning in daily-life settings.

We study low probability estimation in the context of argmax sampling from small transformer language models.

    "title": "Quality Measures for Dynamic Graph Generative Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models have recently achieved significant success in modeling graph data, including dynamic graphs, where topology and features evolve over time. However, unlike in vision and natural language domains, evaluating generative models for dynamic graphs is challenging due to the difficulty of visualizing their output, making quantitative metrics essential. In this work, we develop a new quality metric for evaluating generative models of dynamic graphs. Current metrics for dynamic graphs typically involve discretizing the continuous-evolution of graphs into static snapshots and then applying conventional graph similarity measures. This approach has several limitations: (a) it models temporally related events as i.i.d. samples, failing to capture the non-uniform evolution of dynamic graphs; (b) it lacks a unified measure that is sensitive to both features and topology; (c) it fails to provide a scalar metric, requiring multiple metrics without clear superiority; and (d) it requires explicitly instantiating each static snapshot, leading to impractical runtime demands that hinder evaluation at scale. We propose a novel metric based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, applying random projections directly to dynamic graph data. This results in an expressive, scalar, and application-agnostic measure of dynamic graph similarity that overcomes the limitations of traditional methods. We also provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of metrics for continuous-time dynamic graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Because it is difficult to precisely specify complex objectives, reinforcement learning policies are often optimized using proxy reward functions that only approximate the true goal. However, optimizing proxy rewards frequently leads to reward hacking: the optimized reward function ceases to be a good proxy and the resulting policy performs poorly with respect to the unspecified true reward. Principled solutions to reward hacking have been impeded by the lack of a good definition for the problem. To address this gap, we introduce a definition of reward hacking based on the correlation between proxy and true rewards for states and actions seen by a \"reference policy\" that breaks down under optimization. We show that this definition captures reward hacking behavior across several realistic settings, including in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Using our formulation, we show theoretically that regularization to the reference policy can effectively prevent reward hacking. While the current practice in RLHF applies a KL penalty between action distributions for this purpose, our theory suggests regularizing the χ2 divergence between the policies' occupancy measures can be more effective. We intuitively show the benefits of this type of regularization and demonstrate that it better mitigates reward hacking in practice across four realistic settings, including RLHF.

In this work, we estimate the real-world environmental impact of developing a series of language models, ranging from 20 million to 13 billion active parameters, trained on up to 5.6 trillion tokens each. When accounting for hardware manufacturing, model development, and our final training runs, we find that our series of models released **493 metric tons** of carbon emissions, equivalent to powering about 98 homes in the United States for one year, and consumed **2.769 million liters of water**, equivalent to about 24.5 years of water usage by a person in the United States, even though our data center is extremely water-efficient. We measure and report the environmental impact of our model development; to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so for LLMs, and we find that model development, the impact of which is generally not disclosed by most model developers, amounted to **~50%** of that of training. By looking at detailed time series data for power consumption, we also find that power usage throughout training is not consistent, fluctuating between ~15% and ~85% of our hardware's maximum power draw, with negative implications for grid-scale planning as demand continues to grow. We close with a discussion on the continued difficulty of estimating the environmental impact of AI systems, and key takeaways for model developers and the public at large",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate substantial capabilities in natural language understanding and generation tasks. With the growing number of LLMs, how to harness the collective expertise of multiple LLMs is an exciting open direction. Toward this goal, we propose a new approach that leverages the collective strengths of multiple LLMs through a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) methodology. In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response. MoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source LLMs achieves a score of 65.1% on AlpacaEval 2.0 compared to 57.5% by GPT-4 Omni",

    "abstract": "Multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) is a key competence of performant transformer language models that is tested by mainstream benchmarks. However, recent evidence shows that models can have quite a range of performance, particularly when the task format is diversified slightly (such as by shuffling answer choice order). In this work we ask: how do successful models perform formatted MCQA? We employ vocabulary projection and activation patching methods to localize key hidden states that encode relevant information for predicting the correct answer. We find that prediction of a specific answer symbol is causally attributed to a few middle layers, and specifically their multi-head self-attention mechanisms. We show that subsequent layers increase the probability of the predicted answer symbol in vocabulary space, and that this probability increase is associated with a sparse set of attention heads with unique roles. We additionally uncover differences in how different models adjust to alternative symbols. Finally, we demonstrate that a synthetic task can disentangle sources of model error to pinpoint when a model has learned formatted MCQA, and show that logit differences between answer choice tokens continue to grow over the course of training",

    "abstract": "We give a principled method for decomposing the predictive uncertainty of a model into aleatoric and epistemic components with explicit semantics relating them to the real-world data distribution. While many works in the literature have proposed such decompositions, they lack the type of formal guarantees we provide. Our method is based on the new notion of higher-order calibration, which generalizes ordinary calibration to the setting of higher-order predictors that predict _mixtures_ over label distributions at every point. We show how to measure as well as achieve higher-order calibration using access to $k$-snapshots, namely examples where each point has $k$ independent conditional labels. Under higher-order calibration, the estimated aleatoric uncertainty at a point is guaranteed to match the real-world aleatoric uncertainty averaged over all points where the prediction is made. To our knowledge, this is the first formal guarantee of this type that places no assumptions whatsoever on the real-world data distribution. Importantly, higher-order calibration is also applicable to existing higher-order predictors such as Bayesian and ensemble models and provides a natural evaluation metric for such models. We demonstrate through experiments that our method produces meaningful uncertainty decompositions in tasks such as image classification",

    "abstract": "The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams—identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. We find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with ventral than either dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of neural tuning",

Unlike in large language models (LLMs), hallucination in LVLMs often arises from misalignments between visual inputs and textual outputs. This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of hallucination, focusing on the unique structure of LVLMs that distinguishes them from LLMs. We identify that hallucinations often arise from the sensitivity of text decoders to vision inputs, a natural phenomenon when image encoders and text decoders are pre-trained separately. Inspired by this, we introduce Visual and Textual Intervention (VTI), a novel technique designed to reduce hallucinations by steering latent space representations during inference to enhance the stability of vision features. As a task-agnostic test-time intervention, VTI can be easily applied to any problem without additional training costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can effectively reduce hallucinations and outperform baseline methods across multiple metrics, highlighting the critical role of vision feature stability in LVLMs",

In this work, we investigate methods to mitigate memorization: three regularizer-based, three fine-tuning-based, and eleven machine unlearning-based methods, with five of the latter being new methods that we introduce. We also introduce TinyMem, a suite of small, computationally-efficient LMs for the rapid development and evaluation of memorization-mitigation methods. We demonstrate that the mitigation methods that we develop using TinyMem can successfully be applied to production-grade LMs, and we determine via experiment that: regularizer-based mitigation methods are slow and ineffective at curbing memorization; fine-tuning-based methods are effective at curbing memorization, but overly expensive, especially for retaining higher accuracies; and unlearning-based methods are faster and more effective, allowing for the precise localization and removal of memorized information from LM weights prior to inference. We show, in particular, that our proposed unlearning method BalancedSubnet outperforms other mitigation methods at removing memorized information while preserving performance on target tasks",

TopoNets also predict responses in the brain and replicate the key topographic signatures observed in the brain's visual and language cortices, further bridging the gap between biological and artificial systems.

Moreover, current practices in multilingual benchmark construction often translate English resources, ignoring the regional and cultural knowledge of the environments in which multilingual systems would be used. In this work, we construct an evaluation suite of 197,243 QA pairs from local exam sources to measure the capabilities of multilingual LLMs in a variety of regional contexts.

The original KST formulation, while mathematically elegant, presents practical challenges due to its limited insight into the structure of inner and outer functions and the large number of unknown variables it introduces. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) leverage KST for function approximation, but they have faced scrutiny due to mixed results compared to traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and practical limitations imposed by the original KST formulation. To address these issues, we introduce ActNet, a scalable deep learning model that builds on the KST and overcomes some of the drawbacks of Kolmogorov's original formulation. We evaluate ActNet in the context of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a framework well-suited for leveraging KST's strengths in low-dimensional function approximation, particularly for simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). In this challenging setting, where models must learn latent functions without direct measurements, ActNet consistently outperforms KANs across multiple benchmarks and is competitive against the current best MLP-based approaches. These results present ActNet as a promising new direction for KST-based deep learning applications, particularly in scientific computing and PDE simulation tasks",

    "abstract": "Predicting temporal progress from visual trajectories is important for intelligent robots that can learn, adapt, and improve. However, learning such progress estimator, or temporal value function, across different tasks and domains requires both a large amount of diverse data and methods which can scale and generalize. To address these challenges, we present Generative Value Learning (GVL), a universal value function estimator that leverages the world knowledge embedded in vision-language models (VLMs) to predict task progress. Naively asking a VLM to predict values for a video sequence performs poorly due to the strong temporal correlation between successive frames. Instead, GVL poses value estimation as a temporal ordering problem over shuffled video frames; this seemingly more challenging task encourages VLMs to more fully exploit their underlying semantic and temporal grounding capabilities to differentiate frames based on their perceived task progress, consequently producing significantly better value predictions. Without any robot or task specific training, GVL can in-context zero-shot and few-shot predict effective values for more than 300 distinct real-world tasks across diverse robot platforms, including challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GVL permits flexible multi-modal in-context learning via examples from heterogeneous tasks and embodiments, such as human videos. The generality of GVL enables various downstream applications pertinent to visuomotor policy learning, including dataset filtering, success detection, and value-weighted regression -- all without any model training or finetuning",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Neural compression has brought tremendous progress in designing lossy compressors with good rate-distortion (RD) performance at low complexity. Thus far, neural compression design involves transforming the source to a latent vector, which is then rounded to integers and entropy coded. While this approach has been shown to be optimal on a few specific sources, we show that it can be highly sub-optimal on synthetic sources whose intrinsic dimensionality is greater than one. With integer rounding in the latent space, the quantization regions induced by neural transformations, remain square-like and fail to match those of optimal vector quantization. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the choice of scalar quantization in the latent space, and not the transform design. By employing lattice quantization instead, we propose Lattice Transform Coding (LTC) and show that it approximately recovers optimal vector quantization at reasonable complexity. On real-world sources, LTC improves upon standard neural compressors. LTC also provides a framework that can integrate structurally (near) optimal information-theoretic designs into lossy compression; examples include block coding, which yields coding gain over optimal one-shot coding and approaches the asymptotically-achievable rate-distortion function, as well as nested lattice quantization for low complexity fixed-rate coding",

Moreover, we show the existence of a small number of highly entangled \"Wasserstein Neurons\" in each linear layer of an LLM, characterized by their highly non-Gaussian output distributions, their role in mapping similar inputs to dissimilar outputs, and their significant impact on model accuracy. To study these phenomena, we propose a new experimental framework for disentangling polysemantic neurons. Our framework separates each layer's inputs to create a mixture of experts where each neuron's output is computed by a mixture of neurons of lower Wasserstein distance, each better at maintaining accuracy when sparsified without retraining. We provide strong evidence that this is because the mixture of sparse experts is effectively disentangling the input-output relationship of individual neurons, in particular the difficult Wasserstein neurons",

We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level *concepts* in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that the LLM's *explanations imply* are influential and the set that *truly* are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a hierarchical Bayesian model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias.

Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections. We further introduce \\emph{scaled potentials} and show that for these, mirror flow still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For univariate networks with absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS norm.

WildBench consists of 1,024 tasks carefully selected from over one million human-chatbot conversation logs. For automated evaluation with WildBench, we have developed two metrics, WB-Reward and WB-Score, which are computable using advanced LLMs such as GPT-4-turbo. WildBench evaluation uses task-specific checklists to evaluate model outputs systematically and provides structured explanations that justify the scores and comparisons, resulting in more reliable and interpretable automatic judgments. WB-Reward employs fine-grained pairwise comparisons between model responses, generating five potential outcomes: much better, slightly better, slightly worse, much worse, or a tie. Unlike previous evaluations that employed a single baseline model, we selected three baseline models at varying performance levels to ensure a comprehensive pairwise evaluation. Additionally, we propose a simple method to mitigate length bias, by converting outcomes of \"slightly better/worse\" to \"tie\" if the winner response exceeds the loser one by more than K characters. WB-Score evaluates the quality of model outputs individually, making it a fast and cost-efficient evaluation metric. WildBench results demonstrate a strong correlation with the human-voted Elo ratings from Chatbot Arena on hard tasks. Specifically, WB-Reward achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.98 with top-ranking models.

    "abstract": "Decoder-based large language models (LLMs) have proven highly versatile, with remarkable successes even on problems ostensibly removed from traditional language generation. One such example is solving regression problems, where the targets are real numbers rather than textual tokens. A common approach to use LLMs on such problems is to perform fine-tuning based on the cross-entropy loss, and use autoregressive sampling at inference time. Another approach relies on fine-tuning a separate predictive head with a suitable loss such as squared error. While each approach has had success, there has been limited study on principled ways of using decoder LLMs for regression. In this work, we compare different prior works under a unified view, and introduce regression-aware fine-tuning(RAFT), a novel approach based on the Bayes-optimal decision rule. We demonstrate how RAFT improves over established baselines on several benchmarks and model families",

    "title": "Analyzing Neural Scaling Laws in Two-Layer Networks with Power-Law Data Spectra",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Neural scaling laws describe how the performance of deep neural networks scales with key factors such as training data size, model complexity, and training time, often following power-law behaviors over multiple orders of magnitude. Despite their empirical observation, the theoretical understanding of these scaling laws remains limited. In this work, we employ techniques from statistical mechanics to analyze one-pass stochastic gradient descent within a student-teacher framework, where both the student and teacher are two-layer neural networks. Our study primarily focuses on the generalization error and its behavior in response to data covariance matrices that exhibit power-law spectra. For linear activation functions, we derive analytical expressions for the generalization error, exploring different learning regimes and identifying conditions under which power-law scaling emerges. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-linear activation functions in the feature learning regime, investigating how power-law spectra in the data covariance matrix impact learning dynamics. Importantly, we find that the length of the symmetric plateau depends on the number of distinct eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix and the number of hidden units, demonstrating how these plateaus behave under various configurations. In addition, our results reveal a transition from exponential to power-law convergence in the specialized phase when the data covariance matrix possesses a power-law spectrum. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of neural scaling laws and provides insights into optimizing learning performance in practical scenarios involving complex data structures",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Transformers exhibit in-context learning (ICL): the ability to use novel information presented in the context without additional weight updates. Recent work shows that ICL emerges when models are trained on a sufficiently diverse set of tasks and the transition from memorization to generalization is sharp with increasing task diversity. One interpretation is that a network's limited capacity to memorize favors generalization. Here, we examine the mechanistic underpinnings of this transition using a small transformer applied to a synthetic ICL task. Using theory and experiment, we show that the sub-circuits that memorize and generalize can be viewed as largely independent. The relative *rates* at which these sub-circuits learn explains the transition from memorization to generalization, rather than capacity constraints. We uncover a memorization scaling law, which determines the task diversity threshold at which the network generalizes. The theory quantitatively explains a variety of other ICL-related phenomena, including the long-tailed distribution of when ICL is acquired, the bimodal behavior of solutions close to the task diversity threshold, the influence of contextual and data distributional statistics on ICL, and the transient nature of ICL",

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that scale is important for improved brain decoding, with more data leading to greater decoding accuracy. However, large-scale decoding across many different datasets is challenging because neural circuits are heterogeneous---each brain region contains a unique mix of cellular sub-types, and the responses to different stimuli are diverse across regions and sub-types. It is unknown whether it is possible to pre-train and transfer brain decoding models between distinct tasks, cellular sub-types, and brain regions. To address these questions, we developed a multi-task transformer architecture and trained it on the entirety of the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory dataset. This dataset contains responses from over 100,000 neurons in 6 areas of the brains of mice, observed with two-photon calcium imaging, recorded while the mice observed different types of visual stimuli. Our results demonstrate that transfer is indeed possible -combining data from different sources is beneficial for a number of downstream decoding tasks. As well, we can transfer the model between regions and sub-types, demonstrating that there is in fact common information in diverse circuits that can be extracted by an appropriately designed model. Interestingly, we found that the model's latent representations showed clear distinctions between different brain regions and cellular sub-types, even though it was never given any information about these distinctions. Altogether, our work demonstrates that training a large-scale neural decoding model on diverse data is possible, and this provides a means of studying the differences and similarities between heterogeneous neural circuits",

    "abstract": "Model merging, such as model souping, is the practice of combining different models with the same architecture together without further training. In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate \"experts\" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc",

    "abstract": "Gaussian Processes (GPs) are widely seen as the state-of-the-art surrogate models for Bayesian optimization (BO) due to their ability to model uncertainty and their performance on tasks where correlations are easily captured (such as those defined by Euclidean metrics) and their ability to be efficiently updated online. However, the performance of GPs depends on the choice of kernel, and kernel selection for complex correlation structures is often difficult or must be made bespoke. While Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a promising direction for higher capacity surrogate models, they have so far seen limited use due to poor performance on some problem types. In this paper, we propose an approach which shows competitive performance on many problem types, including some that BNNs typically struggle with. We build on variational Bayesian last layers (VBLLs), and connect training of these models to exact conditioning in GPs. We exploit this connection to develop an efficient online training algorithm that interleaves conditioning and optimization. Our findings suggest that VBLL networks significantly outperform GPs and other BNN architectures on tasks with complex input correlations, and match the performance of well-tuned GPs on established benchmark tasks",

Proposed mutations can be informed by previous measurements or by learning from large antibody databases to predict only typical antibodies. Unfortunately, the space of typical antibodies is enormous to search, and experiments often fail to find suitable antibodies on a budget. We introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a *clonal family*. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody within the human immune system. We propose to guide our designs to fit previous measurements with a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic *in silico* experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in *in vitro* wet lab experiments",

Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings.

Despite diverse strategies (e.g., cipher, low-resource language, persuasions, and so on) that have been proposed and shown success, these strategies are still manually designed, limiting their scope and effectiveness as a red-teaming tool. In this paper, we propose AutoDAN-Turbo, a black-box jailbreak method that can automatically discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (e.g., specified candidate strategies), and use them for red-teaming. As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5 attack success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo. In addition, AutoDAN-Turbo is a unified framework that can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a plug-and-play manner. By integrating human-designed strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher attack success rate of 93.4 on GPT-4-1106-turbo",

However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,398 real-world queries spanning diverse domains such as economics, psychology, mathematics, coding, and more. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring or carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,1 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.0 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question answering performance by over 6.6 points.

Additionally, cells can leverage memory of past environments to better survive previously-encountered stressors. From a control perspective, this adaptability poses significant challenges in driving cell populations toward extinction, and is thus an open question with great clinical significance. In this work, we focus on drug dosing in cell populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity. For specific dynamical models switching between resistant and susceptible states, exact solutions are known. However, when the underlying system parameters are unknown, and for complex memory-based systems, obtaining the optimal solution is currently intractable. To address this challenge, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to identify informed dosing strategies to control cell populations evolving under novel non-Markovian dynamics. We find that model-free deep RL is able to recover exact solutions and control cell populations even in the presence of long-range temporal dynamics. To further test our approach in more realistic settings, we demonstrate performant RL-based control strategies in environments with dynamic memory strength",

Prior approaches to mitigate this issue assume task labels (which are often not available in practice), employ brittle regularization heuristics, or use off-policy methods that suffer from instability and poor performance. We present Locally Constrained Policy Optimization (LCPO), an online RL approach that combats CF by anchoring policy outputs on old experiences while optimizing the return on current experiences. To perform this anchoring, LCPO locally constrains policy optimization using samples from experiences that lie outside of the current context distribution. We evaluate LCPO in Mujoco, classic control and computer systems environments with a variety of synthetic and real context traces, and find that it outperforms a variety of baselines in the non-stationary setting, while achieving results on-par with a \"prescient\" agent trained offline across all context traces.

The curation of CEB is based on our newly proposed compositional taxonomy, which characterizes each dataset from three dimensions: bias types, social groups, and tasks.

Till date, it remains unknown how to use watermarking techniques to trace and audit synthetic tables generated by tabular diffusion models to mitigate potential misuses. In this paper, we design TabWak, the first watermarking method to embed invisible signatures that control the sampling of Gaussian latent codes used to synthesize table rows via the diffusion backbone. TabWak has two key features. Different from existing image watermarking techniques, TabWak uses self-cloning and shuffling to embed the secret key in positional information of random seeds that control the Gaussian latents, allowing to use different seeds at each row for high inter-row diversity and enabling row-wise detectability. To further boost the robustness of watermark detection against post-editing attacks, TabWak uses a valid-bit mechanism that focuses on the tail of the latent code distribution for superior noise resilience. We provide theoretical guarantees on the row diversity and effectiveness of detectability. We evaluate TabWak on five datasets against baselines to show that the quality of watermarked tables remains nearly indistinguishable from non-watermarked tables while achieving high detectability in the presence of strong post-editing attacks, with a 100% true positive rate at a 0.1% false positive rate on synthetic tables with fewer than 300 rows.

To address this gap, we introduce a formal definition of task ambiguity and frame the problem of task disambiguation through the lens of Bayesian Experimental Design. By posing clarifying questions, LLM agents can acquire additional task specifications, progressively narrowing the space of viable solutions and reducing the risk of generating unsatisfactory outputs. Yet, generating effective clarifying questions requires LLM agents to engage in a form of meta-cognitive reasoning, an ability LLMs may presently lack. Our proposed approach of active task disambiguation enables LLM agents to generate targeted questions maximizing the information gain. Effectively, this approach shifts the load from implicit to explicit reasoning about the space of viable solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that this form of question selection leads to more effective task disambiguation in comparison to approaches relying on reasoning solely within the space of questions",

Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference, but it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. This paper addresses these challenges by investigating the pretraining of low-bitwidth models specifically Ternary Language Models (TriLMs) as an alternative to traditional floating-point models (FloatLMs) and their post-training quantized versions (QuantLMs). We present Spectra LLM suite, the first open suite of LLMs spanning multiple bit-widths, including FloatLMs, QuantLMs, and TriLMs, ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that TriLMs offer superior scaling behavior in terms of model size (in bits). Surprisingly, at scales exceeding one billion parameters, TriLMs consistently outperform their QuantLM and FloatLM counterparts for a given bit size across various benchmarks. Notably, the 3.9B parameter TriLM matches the performance of the FloatLM 3.9B across all benchmarks, despite having fewer bits than FloatLM 830M.

Here we bridge these two extremes with the open ended creation of terrestrial endoskeletal robots: deformable soft bodies that leverage jointed internal skeletons to move efficiently across land. Simultaneous de novo generation of external and internal structures is achieved by (i) modeling 3D endoskeletal body plans as integrated collections of elastic and rigid cells that directly attach to form soft tissues anchored to compound rigid bodies; (ii) encoding these discrete mechanical subsystems into a continuous yet coherent latent embedding; (iii) optimizing the sensorimotor coordination of each decoded design using model-free reinforcement learning; and (iv) navigating this smooth yet highly non-convex latent manifold using evolutionary strategies. This yields an endless stream of novel species of ``higher robots'' that, like all higher animals, harness the mechanical advantages of both elastic tissues and skeletal levers for terrestrial travel.

We begin by proving that the storage capacities of both linear and MLP associative memories scale linearly with parameter count. We next introduce a synthetic factual recall task, and prove that a transformer with a single layer of self-attention followed by an MLP can obtain 100\\% accuracy on the task whenever either the total number of self-attention parameters or MLP parameters scales (up to log factors) linearly with the number of facts. In particular, the transformer can trade off between using the value matrices or the MLP as an associative memory to store the dataset of facts.

This paper proposes, $\\textbf{AnalogGenie}$, a $\\underline{\\textbf{Gen}}$erat$\\underline{\\textbf{i}}$ve $\\underline{\\textbf{e}}$ngine for automatic design/discovery of $\\underline{\\textbf{Analog}}$ circuit topologies--the most challenging and creative task in the conventional manual design flow of analog ICs. AnalogGenie addresses two key gaps in the field: building a foundational comprehensive dataset of analog circuit topology and developing a scalable sequence-based graph representation universal to analog circuits. Experimental results show the remarkable generation performance of AnalogGenie in broadening the variety of analog ICs, increasing the number of devices within a single design, and discovering unseen circuit topologies far beyond any prior arts. Our work paves the way to transform the longstanding time-consuming manual design flow of analog ICs to an automatic and massive manner powered by generative AI.

    "title": "Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis with application to neural data",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is critical across various domains of science including neuroscience. Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) is a prominent dimensionality reduction method that provides a probabilistic approach unlike the deterministic approach of PCA and serves as a connection between PCA and Factor Analysis (FA). Despite their power, PPCA and its extensions are mainly based on linear models and can only describe the data in a Euclidean coordinate system around the mean of data. However, in many neuroscience applications, data may be distributed around a nonlinear geometry (i.e., manifold) rather than lying in the Euclidean space around the mean. We develop Probabilistic Geometric Principal Component Analysis (PGPCA) for such datasets as a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that can explicitly incorporate knowledge about a given nonlinear manifold that is first fitted from these data. Further, we show how in addition to the Euclidean coordinate system, a geometric coordinate system can be derived for the manifold to capture the deviations of data from the manifold and noise. We also derive a data-driven EM algorithm for learning the PGPCA model parameters. As such, PGPCA generalizes PPCA to better describe data distributions by incorporating a nonlinear manifold geometry. In simulations and brain data analyses, we show that PGPCA can effectively model the data distribution around various given manifolds and outperforms PPCA for such data. Moreover, PGPCA provides the capability to test whether the new geometric coordinate system better describes the data than the Euclidean one. Finally, PGPCA can perform dimensionality reduction and learn the data distribution both around and on the manifold. These capabilities make PGPCA valuable for enhancing the efficacy of dimensionality reduction for analysis of high-dimensional data that exhibit noise and are distributed around a nonlinear manifold, especially for neural data",

    "title": "DataEnvGym: Data Generation Agents in Teacher Environments with Student Feedback",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The process of creating training data to teach models is currently driven by humans, who manually analyze model weaknesses and plan how to create data that improves a student model. Recent approaches using large language models (LLMs) as annotators reduce human annotation effort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and control the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this labor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents – or teachers – is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the feedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid and scalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a testbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames data generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent consisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating training data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into data), inside an environment that provides feedback from a student. The agent's end goal is to improve student model performance. Students are iteratively trained and evaluated on generated data, with their feedback (in the form of errors or weak skills) being reported to the agent after each iteration. As a general-purpose testbed, DataEnvGym includes multiple instantiations of teacher environments across three levels of structure in the state representation and action space, with varying levels of scaffolding support. More structured environments are based on automatically-inferred skills and offer a higher degree of interpretability and control over the curriculum. We support developing and testing data generation agents in four diverse tasks covering text, images, and actions (mathematics, programming, visual question answering, and tool-use) and test multiple student and teacher models. We find that example agents in our teaching environments can iteratively improve students across diverse tasks and settings. Moreover, we show that environments can teach different skill levels and can be used to test variants of key modules, pointing to directions of future work in improving data generation agents, engines, and feedback mechanisms.

    "title": "Correcting the Mythos of KL-Regularization: Direct Alignment without Overoptimization via Chi-Squared Preference Optimization",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Language model alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) have led to impressive advances in language model capabilities, but are limited by a widely observed phenomenon known as *overoptimization*, where the quality of the language model degrades over the course of the alignment process. As the model optimizes performance on an offline reward model, it overfits to inaccuracies and drifts away from preferred responses covered by the data. To discourage such distribution shift, KL-regularization is widely employed in existing offline alignment methods, but overoptimization continues to harm performance. Lending theoretical insight into the source of these empirical observations, we first show that the KL-regularization is too weak to prevent overfitting, then ask: is it possible to design an efficient algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization? In this paper, we advance theoretical understanding of sample-efficient offline alignment and introduce a new algorithm called $\\chi^2$-Preference Optimization ($\\chi$PO). $\\chi$PO is a one-line change to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO; Rafailov et al. 2023), that modifies only the logarithmic link function in the DPO objective. Despite this minimal change, $\\chi$PO implicitly implements the principle of *pessimism in the face of uncertainty* via regularization with the $\\chi^2$-divergence---which quantifies uncertainty more effectively than KL-regularization---and provably alleviates overoptimization, achieving sample-complexity guarantees based on *single-policy concentrability*, the gold standard in offline reinforcement learning. This guarantee makes $\\chi$PO the first simple, yet general-purpose offline alignment algorithm that is provably robust to overoptimization",

    "title": "Exact Certification of (Graph) Neural Networks Against Label Poisoning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models are highly vulnerable to label flipping, i.e., the adversarial modification (poisoning) of training labels to compromise performance. Thus, deriving robustness certificates is important to guarantee that test predictions remain unaffected and to understand worst-case robustness behavior. However, for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), the problem of certifying label flipping has so far been unsolved. We change this by introducing an exact certification method, deriving both sample-wise and collective certificates. Our method leverages the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) to capture the training dynamics of wide networks enabling us to reformulate the bilevel optimization problem representing label flipping into a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). We apply our method to certify a broad range of GNN architectures in node classification tasks. Thereby, concerning the worst-case robustness to label flipping: $(i)$ we establish hierarchies of GNNs on different benchmark graphs; $(ii)$ quantify the effect of architectural choices such as activations, depth and skip-connections; and surprisingly, $(iii)$ uncover a novel phenomenon of the robustness plateauing for intermediate perturbation budgets across all investigated datasets and architectures. While we focus on GNNs, our certificates are applicable to sufficiently wide NNs in general through their NTK. Thus, our work presents the first exact certificate to a poisoning attack ever derived for neural networks, which could be of independent interest.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "General-purpose LLM judges capable of human-level evaluation provide not only a scalable and accurate way of evaluating instruction-following LLMs but also new avenues for supervising and improving their performance. One promising way of leveraging LLM judges for supervision is through Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding, which uses a reference-based evaluator to select a high-quality output from amongst a set of candidate outputs. In the first part of this work, we explore using MBR decoding as a method for improving the test-time performance of instruction-following LLMs. We find that MBR decoding with reference-based LLM judges substantially improves over greedy decoding, best-of-N decoding with reference-free judges and MBR decoding with lexical and embedding-based metrics on AlpacaEval and MT-Bench. These gains are consistent across LLMs with up to 70B parameters, demonstrating that smaller LLM judges can be used to supervise much larger LLMs. Then, seeking to retain the improvements from MBR decoding while mitigating additional test-time costs, we explore iterative self-training on MBR-decoded outputs. We find that self-training using Direct Preference Optimisation leads to significant performance gains, such that the self-trained models with greedy decoding generally match and sometimes exceed the performance of their base models with MBR decoding",

    "abstract": "This paper revisits the problem of predicting box locations in object detection architectures. Typically, each box proposal or box query aims to directly maximize the intersection-over-union score with the ground truth, followed by a winner-takes-all non-maximum suppression where only the highest scoring box in each region is retained. We observe that both steps are sub-optimal: the first involves regressing proposals to the entire ground truth, which is a difficult task even with large receptive fields, and the second neglects valuable information from boxes other than the top candidate. Instead of regressing proposals to the whole ground truth, we propose a simpler approach—regress only to the area of intersection between the proposal and the ground truth. This avoids the need for proposals to extrapolate beyond their visual scope, improving localization accuracy. Rather than adopting a winner-takes-all strategy, we take the union over the regressed intersections of all boxes in a region to generate the final box outputs. Our plug-and-play method integrates seamlessly into proposal-based, grid-based, and query-based detection architectures with minimal modifications, consistently improving object localization and instance segmentation. We demonstrate its broad applicability and versatility across various detection and segmentation tasks",

    "abstract": "The Koopman theory, which enables the transformation of nonlinear systems into linear representations, is a powerful and efficient tool to model and control nonlinear systems. However, the ability of the Koopman operator to model complex systems, particularly time-varying systems, is limited by the fixed linear state-space representation. To address the limitation, the large language model, Mamba, is considered a promising strategy for enhancing modeling capabilities while preserving the linear state-space structure. In this paper, we propose a new framework, the Mamba-based Koopman operator (MamKO), which provides enhanced model prediction capability and adaptability, as compared to Koopman models with constant Koopman operators. Inspired by the Mamba structure, MamKO generates Koopman operators from online data; this enables the model to effectively capture the dynamic behaviors of the nonlinear system over time. A model predictive control system is then developed based on the proposed MamKO model. The modeling and control performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments on benchmark time-invariant and time-varying systems. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach. Additionally, we perform ablation experiments to test the effectiveness of individual components of MamKO. This approach unlocks new possibilities for integrating large language models with control frameworks, and it achieves a good balance between advanced modeling capabilities and real-time control implementation efficiency",

    "abstract": "Emerging 3D geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, offer a promising approach for in-the-wild 3D vision tasks. However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these pre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging circumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this, we propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to *specialize* the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own multi-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust optimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a global coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence into the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the confidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated confidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and fine-tune the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on the pseudo-labeled data. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It completes the self-calibration process on a **single standard GPU within just 5 minutes**. Each low-rank adapter requires only **18MB** of storage. We evaluated our method on **more than 160 scenes** from the Replica, TUM and Waymo Open datasets, achieving up to **88\\% performance improvement** on 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation and novel-view rendering.

    "abstract": "In typical multimodal contrastive learning, such as CLIP, encoders produce one point in the latent representation space for each input. However, one-point representation has difficulty in capturing the relationship and the similarity structure of a huge amount of instances in the real world. For richer classes of the similarity, we propose the use of weighted point sets, namely, sets of pairs of weight and vector, as representations of instances. In this work, we theoretically show the benefit of our proposed method through a new understanding of the contrastive loss of CLIP, which we call symmetric InfoNCE. We clarify that the optimal similarity that minimizes symmetric InfoNCE is the pointwise mutual information, and show an upper bound of excess risk on downstream classification tasks of representations that achieve the optimal similarity. In addition, we show that our proposed similarity based on weighted point sets consistently achieves the optimal similarity. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method, we demonstrate pretraining of text-image representation models and classification tasks on common benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Extremely low-resource (XLR) languages lack substantial corpora for training NLP models, motivating the use of all available resources such as dictionaries and grammar books. Machine Translation from One Book (Tanzer et al., 2024) suggests that prompting long-context LLMs with one grammar book enables English–Kalamang translation, an XLR language unseen by LLMs—a noteworthy case of linguistics helping an NLP task. We investigate the source of this translation ability, finding almost all improvements stem from the book's parallel examples rather than its grammatical explanations. We find similar results for Nepali and Guarani, seen low-resource languages, and we achieve performance comparable to an LLM with a grammar book by simply fine-tuning an encoder-decoder translation model. We then investigate where grammar books help by testing two linguistic tasks, grammaticality judgment and gloss prediction, and we explore what kind of grammatical knowledge helps by introducing a typological feature prompt that achieves leading results on these more relevant tasks. We thus emphasise the importance of task-appropriate data for XLR languages: parallel examples for translation, and grammatical data for linguistic tasks. As we find no evidence that long-context LLMs can make effective use of grammatical explanations for XLR translation, we conclude data collection for multilingual XLR tasks such as translation is best focused on parallel data over linguistic description",

Numerous works, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and their variants, have significantly enhanced the quality of these representations. The ease of construction from 2D images, suitability for online viewing/sharing, and applications in game/art design downstream tasks make it a vital 3D representation, with potential creation of large numbers of such 3D models. This necessitates large data stores, local or online, to save 3D visual data in these formats. However, no existing framework enables accurate retrieval of stored 3DNGRs. In this work, we propose, Retri3D, a framework that enables accurate and efficient retrieval of 3D scenes represented as NGRs from large data stores using text queries. We introduce a novel Neural Field Artifact Analysis technique, combined with a Smart Camera Movement Module, to select clean views and navigate pre-trained 3DNGRs. These techniques enable accurate retrieval by selecting the best viewing directions in the 3D scene for high-quality visual feature embeddings.

However, such an assumption is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity and diversity of queries, thus leading to the query shift problem. Specifically, query shift refers to the online query stream originating from the domain that follows a different distribution with the source one. In this paper, we observe that query shift would not only diminish the uniformity (namely, within-modality scatter) of the query modality but also amplify the gap between query and gallery modalities. Based on the observations, we propose a novel method dubbed Test-time adaptation for Cross-modal Retrieval (TCR). In brief, TCR employs a novel module to refine the query predictions (namely, retrieval results of the query) and a joint objective to prevent query shift from disturbing the common space, thus achieving online adaptation for the cross-modal retrieval models with query shift. Expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TCR against query shift. Code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-ICLR-TCR",

In any such system it is crucial to ensure the fairness of outcomes across protected groups, and researchers have proposed that Equalized Coverage be used as the standard for fairness. By conducting experiments with human participants, we demonstrate that providing prediction sets can lead to disparate impact in decisions.

In search of the forgotten domain generalization, we create large-scale datasets subsampled from LAION---LAION-Natural and LAION-Rendition---that are strictly OOD to corresponding ImageNet and DomainNet test sets in terms of style. Training CLIP models on these datasets reveals that a significant portion of their performance is explained by in-domain examples. This indicates that the OOD generalization challenges from the ImageNet era still prevail and that training on web-scale data merely creates the illusion of OOD generalization. Furthermore, through a systematic exploration of combining natural and rendition datasets in varying proportions, we identify optimal mixing ratios for model generalization across these domains.

In ERL, policies predict entire action trajectories over multiple time steps instead of single actions at every time step. These trajectories are typically parameterized by trajectory generators such as Movement Primitives (MP), allowing for smooth and efficient exploration over long horizons while capturing high-level temporal correlations. However, ERL methods are often constrained to on-policy frameworks due to the difficulty of evaluating state-action values for entire action sequences, limiting their sample efficiency and preventing the use of more efficient off-policy architectures. TOP-ERL addresses this shortcoming by segmenting long action sequences and estimating the state-action values for each segment using a transformer-based critic architecture alongside an n-step return estimation. These contributions result in efficient and stable training that is reflected in the empirical results conducted on sophisticated robot learning environments. TOP-ERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art RL methods. Thorough ablation studies additionally show the impact of key design choices on the model performance",

However, due to the Adam's complexity, theoretical analysis of how it optimizes transformers remains a challenging task. Fortunately, Sign Gradient Descent (SignGD) serves as an effective surrogate for Adam. Despite its simplicity, theoretical understanding of how SignGD optimizes transformers still lags behind. In this work, we study how SignGD optimizes a two-layer transformer -- consisting of a softmax attention layer with trainable query-key parameterization followed by a linear layer -- on a linearly separable noisy dataset. We identify four stages in the training dynamics, each exhibiting intriguing behaviors. Based on the training dynamics, we prove the fast convergence but poor generalization of the learned transformer on the noisy dataset. We also show that Adam behaves similarly to SignGD in terms of both optimization and generalization in this setting. Additionally, we find that the poor generalization of SignGD is not solely due to data noise, suggesting that both SignGD and Adam requires high-quality data for real-world tasks.

    "title": "Emergent Orientation Maps —— Mechanisms, Coding Efficiency and Robustness",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Extensive experimental studies have shown that in lower mammals, neuronal orientation preference in the primary visual cortex is organized in disordered \"salt-and-pepper\" organizations. In contrast, higher-order mammals display a continuous variation in orientation preference, forming pinwheel-like structures. Despite these observations, the spiking mechanisms underlying the emergence of these distinct topological structures and their functional roles in visual processing remain poorly understood. To address this, we developed a self-evolving spiking neural network model with Hebbian plasticity, trained using physiological parameters characteristic of rodents, cats, and primates, including retinotopy, neuronal morphology, and connectivity patterns. Our results identify critical factors, such as the degree of input visual field overlap, neuronal connection range, and the balance between localized connectivity and long-range competition, that determine the emergence of either salt-and-pepper or pinwheel-like topologies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pinwheel structures exhibit lower wiring costs and enhanced sparse coding capabilities compared to salt-and-pepper organizations. They also maintain greater coding robustness against noise in naturalistic visual stimuli. These findings suggest that such topological structures confer significant computational advantages in visual processing and highlight their potential application in the design of brain-inspired deep learning networks and algorithms",

    "title": "Harnessing Diversity for Important Data Selection in Pretraining Large Language Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Data selection is of great significance in pretraining large language models, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available training corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several limitations. (1) Calculating the accurate influence of all available data is time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which may hinder the pretrained model's ability to generalize effectively to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce $\\texttt{Quad}$, a data selection approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to achieve state-of-the-art pretraining results. To compute the influence ($i.e.,$ the quality) more accurately and efficiently, we incorporate the attention layers to capture more semantic details, which can be accelerated through the Kronecker product. For the diversity, $\\texttt{Quad}$ clusters the dataset into similar data instances within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the influence to prevent processing all instances. Overall, we favor clusters with highly influential instances (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity. Experiments on Slimpajama and FineWeb over 7B large language models demonstrate that $\\texttt{Quad}$ significantly outperforms other data selection methods with a low FLOPs consumption. Further analysis also validates the effectiveness of our influence calculation",

However, existing static clipping strategies yield inconsistent results: enhancing robustness against some attacks while being ineffective or even detrimental against others. To address this limitation, we propose a principled adaptive clipping strategy, Adaptive Robust Clipping (ARC), which dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on the input gradients. We prove that ARC not only preserves the theoretical robustness guarantees of SOTA Robust-DGD methods but also provably improves asymptotic convergence when the model is well-initialized. Extensive experiments on benchmark image classification tasks confirm these theoretical insights, demonstrating that ARC significantly enhances robustness, particularly in highly heterogeneous and adversarial settings",

Interestingly, we also show that the use of the missingness indicator is beneficial to the prediction performance, even in MCAR scenarios.

This requirement limits their applicability in scenarios where only unpaired feedback—for example, either positive or negative— is available. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that decouples learning from positive and negative feedback. This decoupling enables control over the influence of each feedback type and, importantly, allows learning even when only one feedback type is present. A key contribution is demonstrating stable learning from negative feedback alone, a capability not well-addressed by current methods. Our approach builds upon the probabilistic framework introduced in (Dayan and Hinton, 1997), which uses expectation-maximization (EM) to directly optimize the probability of positive outcomes (as opposed to classic expected reward maximization). We address a key limitation in current EM-based methods: they solely maximize the likelihood of positive examples, while neglecting negative ones. We show how to extend EM algorithms to explicitly incorporate negative examples, leading to a theoretically grounded algorithm that offers an intuitive and versatile way to learn from both positive and negative feedback.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery, or identifying causal relationships from observational data, is a notoriously challenging task, with numerous methods proposed to tackle it. Despite this, in-the-wild evaluation of these methods is still lacking, as works frequently rely on synthetic data evaluation and sparse real-world examples under critical theoretical assumptions. Real-world causal structures, however, are often complex, evolving over time, non-linear, and influenced by unobserved factors, making it hard to decide on a proper causal discovery strategy. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalRivers, the largest in-the-wild causal discovery benchmarking kit for time-series data to date. CausalRivers features an extensive dataset on river discharge that covers the eastern German territory (666 measurement stations) and the state of Bavaria (494 measurement stations). It spans the years 2019 to 2023 with a 15-minute temporal resolution. Further, we provide additional data from a flood around the Elbe River, as an event with a pronounced distributional shift. Leveraging multiple sources of information and time-series meta-data, we constructed two distinct causal ground truth graphs (Bavaria and eastern Germany). These graphs can be sampled to generate thousands of subgraphs to benchmark causal discovery across diverse and challenging settings. To demonstrate the utility of CausalRivers, we evaluate several causal discovery approaches through a set of experiments to identify areas for improvement. CausalRivers has the potential to facilitate robust evaluations and comparisons of causal discovery methods. Besides this primary purpose, we also expect that this dataset will be relevant for connected areas of research, such as time-series forecasting and anomaly detection. Based on this, we hope to push benchmark-driven method development that fosters advanced techniques for causal discovery, as is the case for many other areas of machine learning",

Such processes can often be accurately modeled via stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which naturally imply causal relationships via `which variables enter the differential of which other variables'. In this paper, we develop conditional independence (CI) constraints on coordinate processes over selected intervals that are Markov with respect to the acyclic dependence graph (allowing self-loops) induced by a general SDE model. We then provide a sound and complete causal discovery algorithm, capable of handling both fully and partially observed data, and uniquely recovering the underlying or induced ancestral graph by exploiting time directionality assuming a CI oracle. Finally, to make our algorithm practically usable, we also propose a flexible, consistent signature kernel-based CI test to infer these constraints from data.

Yet, conformal prediction is not reliable under poisoning attacks where adversaries manipulate both training and calibration data, which can significantly alter prediction sets in practice. As a solution, we propose reliable prediction sets (RPS): the first efficient method for constructing conformal prediction sets with provable reliability guarantees under poisoning. To ensure reliability under training poisoning, we introduce smoothed score functions that reliably aggregate predictions of classifiers trained on distinct partitions of the training data. To ensure reliability under calibration poisoning, we construct multiple prediction sets, each calibrated on distinct subsets of the calibration data. We then aggregate them into a majority prediction set, which includes a class only if it appears in a majority of the individual sets. Both proposed aggregations mitigate the influence of datapoints in the training and calibration data on the final prediction set. We experimentally validate our approach on image classification tasks, achieving strong reliability while maintaining utility and preserving coverage on clean data.

    "abstract": "Aligning language models (LMs) with human preferences has become a key area of research, enabling these models to meet diverse user needs better. Inspired by weak-to-strong generalization, where a strong LM fine-tuned on labels generated by a weaker model can consistently outperform its weak supervisor, we extend this idea to model alignment. In this work, we observe that the alignment behavior in weaker models can be effectively transferred to stronger models and even exhibit an amplification effect. Based on this insight, we propose a method called Weak-to-Strong Preference Optimization (WSPO), which achieves strong model alignment by learning the distribution differences before and after the alignment of the weak model. Experiments demonstrate that WSPO delivers outstanding performance, improving the win rate of Qwen2-7B-Instruct on Arena-Hard from 39.70 to 49.60, achieving a remarkable 47.04 length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2, and scoring 7.33 on MT-bench.

LiFT introduces a novel hierarchical Bayesian model that can be superior to both existing general meta learning algorithms like MAML and recent LoRA zoo mixing approaches such as LoRA-Retriever and model-based clustering. In our Bayesian model, the parameters of the task-specific LoRA modules are regarded as random variables where these task-wise LoRA modules are governed/regularized by higher-level latent random variables, which represents the prior of the LoRA modules that capture the shared information across all training tasks. To make the posterior inference feasible, we propose a novel SGLD-Gibbs sampling algorithm that is computationally efficient. To represent the posterior samples from the SGLD-Gibbs, we propose an online EM algorithm that maintains a Gaussian mixture representation for the posterior in an online manner in the course of iterative posterior sampling.

In this paper, we argue that curriculum training is crucial to equipping generative models with a fundamental understanding of compositionality. To achieve this, we leverage large-language models (LLMs) to automatically compose complex scenarios and harness Visual-Question Answering (VQA) checkers to automatically curate a contrastive dataset, ConPair, consisting of 15k pairs of high-quality contrastive images. These pairs feature minimal visual discrepancies and cover a wide range of attribute categories, especially complex and natural scenarios. To learn effectively from these error cases (i.e., hard negative images), we propose EvoGen, a new multi-stage curriculum for contrastive learning of diffusion models.

Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology.

Current watermarking techniques offer high detectability, minimal impact on text quality, and robustness to text editing. However, current researches lack investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLM services. This is crucial as LLM providers may not want to disclose the presence of watermarks in real-world scenarios, as it could reduce user willingness to use the service and make watermarks more vulnerable to attacks. This work is the first to investigate the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs. We design an identification algorithm called Water-Probe that detects watermarks through well-designed prompts to the LLM. Our key motivation is that current watermarked LLMs expose consistent biases under the same watermark key, resulting in similar differences across prompts under different watermark keys. Experiments show that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms are easily identified with our well-designed prompts, while Water-Probe demonstrates a minimal false positive rate for non-watermarked LLMs. Finally, we propose that the key to enhancing the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs is to increase the randomness of watermark key selection. Based on this, we introduce the Water-Bag strategy, which significantly improves watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys",

The distinctive local topology, the abundant heterogeneous features, and the time dimension of the graph data are more prone to expose sensitive information and narrow down the scope of victim candidates, which calls for well-defined protection techniques on graphs. To this end, we propose a Temporal Heterogeneous Graph Generator balancing Privacy, Utility, and Efficiency, named THePUff. More specifically, we first propose a differential privacy algorithm to perturb the input temporal heterogeneous graph for protecting privacy, and then utilize both the perturbed graph and the original one in a generative adversarial setting for THePUff to learn and generate privacy-guaranteed and utility-preserved graph data in an efficient manner. We further propose 6 new metrics in the temporal setting to measure heterogeneous graph utility and privacy. Finally, based on temporal heterogeneous graph datasets with up to 1 million nodes and 20 million edges, the experiments show that THePUff generates utilizable temporal heterogeneous graphs with privacy protected, compared with state-of-the-art baselines",

To deepen our understanding of their sequential modeling capabilities, there is a growing interest in using Markov input processes to study them. A key finding is that when trained on first-order Markov chains, transformers with two or more layers consistently develop an induction head mechanism to estimate the in-context bigram conditional distribution. In contrast, single-layer transformers, unable to form an induction head, directly learn the Markov kernel but often face a surprising challenge: they become trapped in local minima representing the unigram distribution, whereas deeper models reliably converge to the ground-truth bigram. While single-layer transformers can theoretically model first-order Markov chains, their empirical failure to learn this simple kernel in practice remains a curious phenomenon. To explain this contrasting behavior of single-layer models, in this paper we introduce a new framework for a principled analysis of transformers via Markov chains. Leveraging our framework, we theoretically characterize the loss landscape of single-layer transformers and show the existence of global minima (bigram) and bad local minima (unigram) contingent on data properties and model architecture. We precisely delineate the regimes under which these local optima occur. Backed by experiments, we demonstrate that our theoretical findings are in congruence with the empirical results.

This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries for mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons. Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable, remain fixed-parameter intractable relative to model/circuit features, and inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability or fixed-parameter tractability of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands on existing and future architectures",

    "abstract": "Given two boundary distributions, the \\emph{Schrödinger Bridge} (SB) problem seeks the \"most likely\" random evolution between them with respect to a reference process. It has revealed rich connections to recent machine learning methods for generative modeling and distribution matching. While these methods perform well in Euclidean domains, they are not directly applicable to topological domains such as graphs and simplicial complexes, which are crucial for data defined over network entities, such as node signals and edge flows. In this work, we propose the \\emph{Topological Schrödinger Bridge problem} ($\\mathcal{T}$SBP) for matching signal distributions on a topological domain. We set the reference process to follow some linear tractable \\emph{topology-aware} stochastic dynamics such as topological heat diffusion. For the case of Gaussian boundary distributions, we derive a \\emph{closed-form} topological SB ($\\mathcal{T}$SB) in terms of its time-marginal and stochastic differential. In the general case, leveraging the well-known result, we show that the optimal process follows the forward-backward topological dynamics governed by some unknowns. Building on these results, we develop $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models for matching topological signals by parameterizing the unknowns in the optimal process as \\emph{(topological) neural networks} and learning them through \\emph{likelihood training}. We validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical applications of $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models on both synthetic and real-world networks, emphasizing the role of topology. Additionally, we discuss the connections of $\\mathcal{T}$SB-based models to other emerging models, and outline future directions for topological signal matching",

We show the value of TK by providing simple & diverse kernels that match or outperform prior art.

We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. gRNAde uses a multi-state Graph Neural Network and autoregressive decoding to generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010), gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent ribozyme. Experimental wet lab validation on 10 different structured RNA backbones finds that gRNAde has a success rate of 50% at designing pseudoknotted RNA structures, a significant advance over 35% for Rosetta.

We conduct a theoretical study that attempts to demystify compositionality in standard non-linear networks through the second-order Taylor approximation of the loss function. The proposed formulation highlights the importance of staying within the pre-training basin to achieve composable modules. Moreover, it provides the basis for two dual incremental training algorithms: the one from the perspective of multiple models trained individually, while the other aims to optimize the composed model as a whole. We probe their application in incremental classification tasks and highlight some valuable skills. In fact, the pool of incrementally learned modules not only supports the creation of an effective multi-task model but also enables unlearning and specialization in certain tasks.

Our key observation is that a wealth of informal information that is not present in formal proofs can be useful for learning to prove theorems. For instance, humans think through steps of a proof, but this thought process is not visible in the resulting code. We present Lean-STaR, a framework for training language models to produce informal thoughts prior to each step of a proof, thereby boosting the model's theorem-proving capabilities. Lean-STaR uses retrospective ground-truth tactics to generate synthetic thoughts for training the language model. At inference time, the trained model directly generates the thoughts prior to the prediction of the tactics in each proof step. Building on the self-taught reasoner framework, we then apply expert iteration to further fine-tune the model on the correct proofs it samples and verifies using the Lean solver. Lean-STaR significantly outperform base models (43.4% → 46.3%, Pass@64).

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Spectral Compressive Imaging (SCI) reconstruction is inherently ill-posed, offering multiple plausible solutions from a single observation. Traditional deterministic methods typically struggle to effectively recover high-frequency details. Although diffusion models offer promising solutions to this challenge, their application is constrained by the limited training data and high computational demands associated with multispectral images (MSIs), complicating direct training. To address these issues, we propose a novel Predict-and-unmixing-driven-Subspace-Refine framework (PSR-SCI). This framework begins with a cost-effective predictor that produces an initial, rough estimate of the MSI. Subsequently, we introduce a unmixing-driven reversible spectral embedding module that decomposes the MSI into subspace images and spectral coefficients. This decomposition facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained RGB diffusion models and focuses refinement processes on high-frequency details, thereby enabling efficient diffusion generation with minimal MSI data. Additionally, we design a high-dimensional guidance mechanism with imaging consistency to enhance the model's efficacy. The refined subspace image is then reconstructed back into an MSI using the reversible embedding, yielding the final MSI with full spectral resolution. Experimental results on the standard KAIST and zero-shot datasets NTIRE, ICVL, and Harvard show that PSR-SCI enhances visual quality and delivers PSNR and SSIM metrics comparable to existing diffusion, transformer, and deep unfolding techniques. This framework provides a robust alternative to traditional deterministic SCI reconstruction methods.

Although current PTQ methods have achieved promising results by addressing outliers and employing layer- or block-wise loss optimization techniques, they still suffer from significant performance degradation at ultra-low bits precision. To dissect this issue, we conducted an in-depth analysis of quantization errors specific to LLMs and surprisingly discovered that, unlike traditional sources of quantization errors, the growing number of model parameters, combined with the reduction in quantization bits, intensifies inter-layer and intra-layer dependencies, which severely impact quantization accuracy. This finding highlights a critical challenge in quantizing LLMs. To address this, we propose CBQ, a cross-block reconstruction-based PTQ method for LLMs. CBQ leverages a cross-block dependency to establish long-range dependencies across multiple blocks and integrates an adaptive LoRA-Rounding technique to manage intra-layer dependencies. To further enhance performance, CBQ incorporates a coarse-to-fine pre-processing mechanism for processing weights and activations. Extensive experiments show that CBQ achieves superior low-bit quantization (W4A4, W4A8, W2A16) and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various LLMs and datasets. Notably, CBQ only takes 4.3 hours to quantize a weight-only quantization of a 4-bit LLAMA1-65B model, achieving a commendable trade off between performance and efficiency",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Language model (LM) post-training relies on two stages of human supervision: task demonstrations for supervised finetuning (SFT), followed by preference comparisons for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). As LMs become more capable, the tasks they are given become harder to supervise. Will post-training remain effective under unreliable supervision? To test this, we simulate unreliable demonstrations and comparison feedback using small LMs and time-constrained humans. We find that in the presence of unreliable supervision, SFT still retains some effectiveness, but DPO (a common RLHF algorithm) fails to improve the model beyond SFT. To address this, we propose *iterative label refinement* (ILR) as an alternative to RLHF. ILR improves the SFT data by using comparison feedback to decide whether human demonstrations should be replaced by model-generated alternatives, then retrains the model via SFT on the updated data. SFT+ILR outperforms SFT+DPO on several tasks with unreliable supervision (math, coding, and safe instruction-following). Our findings suggest that as LMs are used for complex tasks where human supervision is unreliable, RLHF may no longer be the best use of human comparison feedback; instead, it is better to direct feedback towards improving the training *data* rather than continually training the *model*.

Unlike the stochastic MAB setting where loss distributions are stationary with time, our study extends to the adversarial setup, where losses are generated from heavy-tailed distributions that depend on both arms and time. Our novel algorithm `uniINF` enjoys the so-called Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) property, performing optimally in both stochastic and adversarial environments *without* knowing the exact environment type. Moreover, our algorithm also possesses a Parameter-Free feature, *i.e.*, it operates *without* the need of knowing the heavy-tail parameters $(\\sigma, \\alpha)$ a-priori. To be precise, `uniINF` ensures nearly-optimal regret in both stochastic and adversarial environments, matching the corresponding lower bounds when $(\\sigma, \\alpha)$ is known (up to logarithmic factors). To our knowledge, `uniINF` is the first parameter-free algorithm to achieve the BoBW property for the heavy-tailed MAB problem.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved unprecedented proficiency in generating realistic images. However, their inherent tendency to memorize and replicate training data during inference raises significant concerns, including potential copyright infringement. In response, various methods have been proposed to evaluate, detect, and mitigate memorization. Our analysis reveals that existing approaches significantly underperform in handling local memorization, where only specific image regions are memorized, compared to global memorization, where the entire image is replicated. Also, they cannot locate the local memorization regions, making it hard to investigate locally. To address these, we identify a novel \"bright ending\" (BE) anomaly in diffusion models prone to memorizing training images. BE refers to a distinct cross-attention pattern observed in text-to-image diffusion models, where memorized image patches exhibit significantly greater attention to the final text token during the last inference step than non-memorized patches. This pattern highlights regions where the generated image replicates training data and enables efficient localization of memorized regions. Equipped with this, we propose a simple yet effective method to integrate BE into existing frameworks, significantly improving their performance by narrowing the performance gap caused by local memorization. Our results not only validate the successful execution of the new localization task but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across all existing tasks, underscoring the significance of the BE phenomenon",

At its core, the attention block differs in form and functionality from most other architectural components in deep learning—to the extent that, in comparison to MLPs/CNNs, Transformers are more often accompanied by adaptive optimizers, layer normalization, learning rate warmup, etc. The root causes behind these outward manifestations and the precise mechanisms that govern them remain poorly understood. In this work, we bridge this gap by providing a fundamental understanding of what distinguishes the Transformer from the other architectures—grounded in a theoretical comparison of the (loss) Hessian. Concretely, for a single self-attention layer, (a) we first entirely derive the Transformer's Hessian and express it in matrix derivatives; (b) we then characterize it in terms of data, weight, and attention moment dependencies; and (c) while doing so further highlight the important structural differences to the Hessian of classical networks. Our results suggest that various common architectural and optimization choices in Transformers can be traced back to their highly non-linear dependencies on the data and weight matrices, which vary heterogeneously across parameters.

    "abstract": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are a novel class of generative models designed to sample from unnormalized distributions and have found applications in various important tasks, attracting great research interest in their training algorithms. In general, GFlowNets are trained by fitting the forward flow to the backward flow on sampled training objects. Prior work focused on the choice of training objects, parameterizations, sampling and resampling strategies, and backward policies, aiming to enhance credit assignment, exploration, or exploitation of the training process. However, the choice of regression loss, which can highly influence the exploration and exploitation behavior of the under-training policy, has been overlooked. Due to the lack of theoretical understanding for choosing an appropriate regression loss, most existing algorithms train the flow network by minimizing the squared error of the forward and backward flows in log-space, i.e., using the quadratic regression loss. In this work, we rigorously prove that distinct regression losses correspond to specific divergence measures, enabling us to design and analyze regression losses according to the desired properties of the corresponding divergence measures. Specifically, we examine two key properties: zero-forcing and zero-avoiding, where the former promotes exploitation and higher rewards, and the latter encourages exploration and enhances diversity. Based on our theoretical framework, we propose three novel regression losses, namely, Shifted-Cosh, Linex(1/2), and Linex(1). We evaluate them across three benchmarks: hyper-grid, bit-sequence generation, and molecule generation.

To address this dilemma, we propose CBGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for SBDD, that unifies the task as a generative graph completion, analogous to fill-in-the-blank of the 3D complex binding graph. By categorizing existing methods based on their attributes, CBGBench facilitates a modular and extensible framework that implements cutting-edge methods.

For training algorithm, we introduce a two-stage contrastive instruction-tuning method. It first applies contrastive training with instructions on retrieval datasets, utilizing in-batch negatives and curated hard negative examples. At stage-2, it blends various non-retrieval into instruction tuning, which not only enhances non-retrieval task accuracy but also improves retrieval performance. For training data, we utilize the hard-negative mining, synthetic data generation and existing public available datasets to boost the performance of embedding model. By combining these techniques, our NV-Embed- v1 model secured the No.1 position on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) (as of May 24, 2024), across 56 embedding tasks. NV-Embed-v2 has reclaimed and maintained the top spot on MTEB since August 30, 2024, demonstrating the sustained effectiveness of the proposed methods over time. Also, it achieved the highest scores in the Long Doc section and the second-highest scores in the QA section of the AIR Benchmark, which covers a range of out-of-domain information retrieval topics beyond those in MTEB. We further provide the analysis of model compression techniques for generalist embedding models. We open-source the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NV-Embed-v2",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We introduce refined variants of the Local Learning Coefficient (LLC), a measure of model complexity grounded in singular learning theory, to study the development of internal structure in transformer language models during training. By applying these refined LLCs (rLLCs) to individual components of a two-layer attention-only transformer, we gain novel insights into the progressive differentiation and specialization of attention heads. Our methodology reveals how attention heads differentiate into distinct functional roles over the course of training, analyzes the types of data these heads specialize to process, and discovers a previously unidentified multigram circuit. These findings demonstrate that rLLCs provide a principled, quantitative toolkit for developmental interpretability, which aims to understand models through their evolution across the learning process. This work advances the field of developmental interpretability by providing a mathematically rigorous approach to understanding neural networks through the lens of their learning process. More broadly, this work takes a step towards establishing the correspondence between data distributional structure, geometric properties of the loss landscape, learning dynamics, and emergent computational structures in neural networks",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are often augmented with external contexts, such as those used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, these contexts can be inaccurate or intentionally misleading, leading to conflicts with the model's internal knowledge. We argue that robust LLMs should demonstrate situated faithfulness, dynamically calibrating their trust in external information based on their confidence in the internal knowledge and the external context to resolve knowledge conflicts. To benchmark this capability, we evaluate LLMs across several QA datasets, including a newly created dataset featuring in-the-wild incorrect contexts sourced from Reddit posts. We show that when provided with both correct and incorrect contexts, both open-source and proprietary models tend to overly rely on external information, regardless of its factual accuracy. To enhance situated faithfulness, we propose two approaches: Self-Guided Confidence Reasoning (SCR) and Rule-Based Confidence Reasoning (RCR). SCR enables models to self-access the confidence of external information relative to their own internal knowledge to produce the most accurate answer. RCR, in contrast, extracts explicit confidence signals from the LLM and determines the final answer using predefined rules. Our results show that for LLMs with strong reasoning capabilities, such as GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, SCR outperforms RCR, achieving improvements of up to 24.2\\% over a direct input augmentation baseline. Conversely, for a smaller model like Llama-3-8B, RCR outperforms SCR. Fine-tuning SCR with our proposed Confidence Reasoning Direct Preference Optimization (CR-DPO) method improves performance on both seen and unseen datasets, yielding an average improvement of 8.9\\% on Llama-3-8B. In addition to quantitative results, we offer insights into the relative strengths of SCR and RCR. Our findings highlight promising avenues for improving situated faithfulness in LLMs",

This focus often sacrifices diversity and increases the risk of adversarial generation. In contrast, we leverage self-supervised representations as the coherent target and treat sampling as a downstream task—one that focuses on refining image details and correcting generation errors, rather than settling for oversimplified outputs. Our Representative Guidance achieves superior performance and demonstrates the potential of pre-trained self-supervised models in guiding diffusion sampling.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Storing open-source fine-tuned models separately introduces redundancy and increases response times in applications utilizing multiple models. Delta-parameter pruning (DPP), particularly the random drop and rescale (DARE) method proposed by Yu et al., addresses this by pruning the majority of delta parameters—the differences between fine-tuned and pre-trained model weights—while typically maintaining minimal performance loss. However, DARE fails when either the pruning rate or the magnitude of the delta parameters is large. We highlight two key reasons for this failure: (1) an excessively large rescaling factor as pruning rates increase, and (2) high mean and variance in the delta parameters. To push DARE's limits, we introduce DAREx (DARE the eXtreme), which features two algorithmic improvements: (1) DAREx-q, a rescaling factor modification that significantly boosts performance at high pruning rates (e.g., > 30% on COLA and SST2 for encoder models, with even greater gains in decoder models), and (2) DAREx-L2, which combines DARE with AdamR, an in-training method that applies appropriate delta regularization before DPP. We also demonstrate that DAREx-q can be seamlessly combined with vanilla parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques like LoRA and can facilitate structural DPP. Additionally, we revisit the application of importance-based pruning techniques within DPP, demonstrating that they outperform random-based methods when delta parameters are large. Through this comprehensive study, we develop a pipeline for selecting the most appropriate DPP method under various practical scenarios",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, behavioral conditions, and subjects; presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics. Current analysis methods, however, often fail to fully harness the richness of such data, as they provide either uninterpretable representations (e.g., via deep networks) or oversimplify models (e.g., by assuming stationary dynamics or analyzing each session independently). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous neural recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we leverage these diverse views into the brain to learn a unified model of neural dynamics. Specifically, we assume that brain activity is driven by multiple hidden global sub-circuits. These sub-circuits represent global basis interactions between neural ensembles—functional groups of neurons—such that the time-varying decomposition of these sub-circuits defines how the ensembles' interactions evolve over time non-stationarily and non-linearly. We discover the neural ensembles underlying non-simultaneous observations, along with their non-stationary evolving interactions, with our new model, **CREIMBO** (**C**ross-**R**egional **E**nsemble **I**nteractions in **M**ulti-view **B**rain **O**bservations). CREIMBO identifies the hidden composition of per-session neural ensembles through novel graph-driven dictionary learning and models the ensemble dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold spanned by a sparse time-varying composition of the global sub-circuits. Thus, CREIMBO disentangles overlapping temporal neural processes while preserving interpretability due to the use of a shared underlying sub-circuit basis. Moreover, CREIMBO distinguishes session-specific computations from global (session-invariant) ones by identifying session covariates and variations in sub-circuit activations. We demonstrate CREIMBO's ability to recover true components in synthetic data, and uncover meaningful brain dynamics in human high-density electrode recordings, including cross-subject neural mechanisms as well as inter- vs. intra-region dynamical motifs. Furthermore, using mouse whole-brain recordings, we show CREIMBO's ability to discover dynamical interactions that capture task and behavioral variables and meaningfully align with the biological importance of the brain areas they represent",

To overcome this issue, we introduce a geometrically constrained operator-valued kernel that allows us to represent vector fields on tangent bundles of smooth manifolds. The construction of the kernel imposes the geometric constraints that are estimated from the data and ensures the computational feasibility for learning high dimensional systems of ODEs. Once the vector fields are estimated, e.g., by the kernel ridge regression, we need an ODE solver that guarantees the solution to stay on (or close to) the manifold. To overcome this issue, we propose a geometry-preserving ODE solver that approximates the exponential maps corresponding to the ODE solutions. We deduce a theoretical error bound for the proposed solver that guarantees the approximate solutions to lie on the manifold in the limit of large data. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on high-dimensional dynamical systems, including the cavity flow problem, the beating and travelling waves in Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations, and the reaction-diffusion dynamics",

However, single-epoch training would incur a different amount of computations per CL algorithm, and the additional storage cost to store logit or model in addition to replay memory is largely ignored in calculating the storage budget. Arguing different computational and storage budgets hinder fair comparison among CL algorithms in practice, we propose to use floating point operations (FLOPs) and total memory size in Byte as a metric for computational and memory budgets, respectively, to compare and develop CL algorithms in the same ‘total resource budget.' To improve a CL method in a limited total budget, we propose adaptive layer freezing that does not update the layers for less informative batches to reduce computational costs with a negligible loss of accuracy. In addition, we propose a memory retrieval method that allows the model to learn the same amount of knowledge as using random retrieval in fewer iterations. Empirical validations on the CIFAR-10/100, CLEAR-10/100, and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods within the same total budget.

    "abstract": "We initiate a study of the geometry of the visual representation space ---the information channel from the vision encoder to the action decoder--- in an image-based control pipeline learned from behavior cloning. Inspired by the phenomenon of *neural collapse* (NC) in image classification, we empirically demonstrate the prevalent emergence of a similar *law of clustering* in the visual representation space. Specifically, - In discrete image-based control (e.g., Lunar Lander), the visual representations cluster according to the natural discrete action labels; - In continuous image-based control (e.g., Planar Pushing and Block Stacking), the clustering emerges according to ``control-oriented'' classes that are based on (a) the relative pose between the object and the target in the input or (b) the relative pose of the object induced by expert actions in the output. Each of the classes corresponds to one relative pose orthant (REPO). Beyond empirical observation, we show such a law of clustering can be leveraged as an algorithmic tool to improve test-time performance when training a policy with limited expert demonstrations. Particularly, we pretrain the vision encoder using NC as a regularization to encourage control-oriented clustering of the visual features. Surprisingly, such an NC-pretrained vision encoder, when finetuned end-to-end with the action decoder, boosts the test-time performance by 10% to 35%. Real-world vision-based planar pushing experiments confirmed the surprising advantage of control-oriented visual representation pretraining",

In spite of their remarkable success in problems such as drug discovery and phylogenetic inference, the question of when and whether GFlowNets learn to sample from the target distribution remains underexplored. To tackle this issue, we first assess the extent to which a violation of the detailed balance of the underlying flow network might hamper the correctness of GFlowNet's sampling distribution. In particular, we demonstrate that the impact of an imbalanced edge on the model's accuracy is influenced by the total amount of flow passing through it and, as a consequence, is unevenly distributed across the network. We also argue that, depending on the parameterization, imbalance may be inevitable. In this regard, we consider the problem of sampling from distributions over graphs with GFlowNets parameterized by graph neural networks (GNNs) and show that the representation limits of GNNs delineate which distributions these GFlowNets can approximate. Lastly, we address these limitations by proposing a theoretically sound and computationally tractable metric for assessing GFlowNets, experimentally showing it is a better proxy for correctness than popular evaluation protocols",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent across various applications, it is critical to establish safety guardrails to moderate input/output content of LLMs and ensure compliance with safety policies. Existing guardrail models, such as OpenAI Mod and LlamaGuard, treat various safety categories (e.g., self-harm, self-harm/instructions) independently and fail to explicitly capture the intercorrelations among them. This has led to limitations such as ineffectiveness due to inadequate training on long-tail data from correlated safety categories, susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks, and inflexibility regarding new safety categories. To address these limitations, we propose $R^2$-Guard, a robust reasoning enabled LLM guardrail via knowledge-enhanced logical reasoning. Specifically, $R^2$-Guard comprises two parts: data-driven guardrail models and reasoning components. The data-driven guardrail models provide unsafety probabilities of moderated content on different safety categories. We then encode safety knowledge among different categories as first-order logical rules and embed them into a probabilistic graphic model (PGM) based reasoning component. The unsafety probabilities of different categories from data-driven guardrail models are sent to the reasoning component for final inference. We employ two types of PGMs: Markov logic networks (MLNs) and probabilistic circuits (PCs), and optimize PCs to achieve precision-efficiency balance via improved graph structure. We also propose different methods to optimize the weights of knowledge. To further perform stress tests for guardrail models, we employ a pairwise construction method to construct a new safety benchmark TwinSafety, which features principled categories and presents new challenges for moderation. We show that $R^2$-Guard is effective even given unrepresentative categories or challenging jailbreaking prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of $R^2$-Guard by comparisons with eight strong guardrail models on six standard moderation datasets, and demonstrate the robustness of $R^2$-Guard against four SOTA jailbreaking attacks. $R^2$-Guard significantly surpasses SOTA method LlamaGuard by 12.6% on standard moderation datasets and by 59.9% against jailbreaking attacks.

    "abstract": "Neuronal dynamics are highly nonlinear and nonstationary. Traditional methods for extracting the underlying network structure from neuronal activity recordings mainly concentrate on modeling static connectivity, without accounting for key nonstationary aspects of biological neural systems, such as ongoing synaptic plasticity and neuronal modulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce the NetFormer model, an interpretable approach applicable to such systems. In NetFormer, the activity of each neuron across a series of historical time steps is defined as a token. These tokens are then linearly mapped through a query and key mechanism to generate a state- (and hence time-) dependent attention matrix that directly encodes nonstationary connectivity structures. We analyze our formulation from the perspective of nonstationary and nonlinear networked dynamical systems, and show both via an analytical expansion and targeted simulations how it can approximate the underlying ground truth. Next, we demonstrate NetFormer's ability to model a key feature of biological networks, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, whereby connection strengths continually change in response to local activity patterns. We further demonstrate that NetFormer can capture task-induced connectivity patterns on activity generated by task-trained recurrent neural networks. Thus informed, we apply NetFormer to a multi-modal dataset of real neural recordings, which contains neural activity, cell type, and behavioral state information. We show that the NetFormer effectively predicts neural dynamics and identifies cell-type specific, state-dependent dynamic connectivity that matches patterns measured in separate ground-truth physiology experiments, demonstrating its ability to help decode complex neural interactions based on population activity observations alone",

A useful finding is that almost any kind of record of random walks guarantees probabilistic invariance as long as the vertices are anonymized. This enables us, for example, to record random walks in plain text and adopt a language model to read these text records to solve graph tasks. We further establish a parallelism to message passing neural networks using tools from Markov chain theory, and show that over-smoothing in message passing is alleviated by construction in RWNNs, while over-squashing manifests as probabilistic under-reaching.

To address these challenges, we propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient attention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions. DeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through **KV-Guided Grouping**, a method that avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose **Flattened Tree KV Splitting**, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the KV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU utilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99% KV cache IO and nearly 100% IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves up to 2.23/3.59$\\times$ speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three practical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention algorithms.

    "abstract": "Multi-Objective Markov Decision Processes (MO-MDPs) are receiving increasing attention, as real-world decision-making problems often involve conflicting objectives that cannot be addressed by a single-objective MDP. The Pareto front identifies the set of policies that cannot be dominated, providing a foundation for finding Pareto optimal solutions that can efficiently adapt to various preferences. However, finding the Pareto front is a highly challenging problem. Most existing methods either (i) rely on traversing the *continuous preference space*, which is impractical and results in approximations that are difficult to evaluate against the true Pareto front, or (ii) focus solely on deterministic Pareto optimal policies, from which there are no known techniques to characterize the full Pareto front. Moreover, finding the structure of the Pareto front itself remains unclear even in the context of dynamic programming, where the MDP is fully known in advance. In this work, we address the challenge of efficiently discovering the Pareto front, involving both deterministic and stochastic Pareto optimal policies. By investigating the geometric structure of the Pareto front in MO-MDPs, we uncover a key property: the Pareto front is on the boundary of a convex polytope whose vertices all correspond to deterministic policies, and neighboring vertices of the Pareto front differ by only one state-action pair of the deterministic policy, almost surely. This insight transforms the global comparison across all policies into a localized search among deterministic policies that differ by only one state-action pair, drastically reducing the complexity of searching for the exact Pareto front. We develop an efficient algorithm that identifies the vertices of the Pareto front by solving a single-objective MDP only once and then traversing the edges of the Pareto front, making it more efficient than existing methods. Furthermore, the entire Pareto front can be found in $V$ iterations, where $V$ represents the number of vertices on the Pareto front. Our empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical strategy in discovering the Pareto front efficiently",

Instead of flipping each label into a single scalar, our method converts each label into a random vector with K components, whose expectations reflect class conditional probabilities. Intuitively, vector approximation retains more information than scalar labels. A brief theoretical analysis shows that the performance of our method only decays slightly with K. Finally, we conduct experiments on both synthesized and real datasets, which validate our theoretical analysis as well as the practical performance of our method",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We consider multi-draft speculative sampling, where the proposal sequences are sampled independently from different draft models. At each step, a token-level draft selection scheme takes a list of valid tokens as input and produces an output token whose distribution matches that of the target model. Previous works have demonstrated that the optimal scheme (which maximizes the probability of accepting one of the input tokens) can be cast as a solution to a linear program. In this work we show that the optimal scheme can be decomposed into a two-step solution: in the first step an importance sampling (IS) type scheme is used to select one intermediate token; in the second step (single-draft) speculative sampling is applied to generate the output token. For the case of two identical draft models we further 1) establish a necessary and sufficient condition on the distributions of the target and draft models for the acceptance probability to equal one and 2) provide an explicit expression for the optimal acceptance probability. Our theoretical analysis also motives a new class of token-level selection schemes based on weighted importance sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in the achievable block efficiency and token rates over baseline schemes in a number of scenarios",

The open-ended nature and diverse use-cases of chatbots necessitate novel methods for bias assessment. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a scalable counterfactual approach to evaluate \"first-person fairness,\" meaning fairness toward chatbot users based on demographic characteristics. Our method employs a Language Model as a Research Assistant (LMRA) to yield quantitative measures of harmful stereotypes and qualitative analyses of demographic differences in chatbot responses. We apply this approach to assess biases in six of our language models across millions of interactions, covering sixty-six tasks in nine domains and spanning two genders and four races. Independent human annotations corroborate the LMRA-generated bias evaluations. This study represents the first large-scale fairness evaluation based on real-world chat data. We highlight that post-training reinforcement learning techniques significantly mitigate these biases. This evaluation provides a practical methodology for ongoing bias monitoring and mitigation",

    "title": "Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to \"imagine\" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks",

    "abstract": "The attention operator is arguably the key distinguishing factor of transformer architectures, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on a variety of tasks. However, transformer attention operators often impose a significant computational burden, with the computational complexity scaling quadratically with the number of tokens. In this work, we propose a novel transformer attention operator whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of tokens. We derive our network architecture by extending prior work which has shown that a transformer style architecture naturally arises by \"white-box\" architecture design, where each layer of the network is designed to implement an incremental optimization step of a maximal coding rate reduction objective (MCR$^2$). Specifically, we derive a novel variational form of the MCR$^2$ objective and show that the architecture that results from unrolled gradient descent of this variational objective leads to a new attention module called Token Statistics Self-Attention ($\\texttt{TSSA}$). $\\texttt{TSSA}$ has $\\textit{linear computational and memory complexity}$ and radically departs from the typical attention architecture that computes pairwise similarities between tokens. Experiments on vision, language, and long sequence tasks show that simply swapping $\\texttt{TSSA}$ for standard self-attention, which we refer to as the Token Statistics Transformer ($\\texttt{ToST}$), achieves competitive performance with conventional transformers while being significantly more computationally efficient and interpretable. Our results also somewhat call into question the conventional wisdom that pairwise similarity style attention mechanisms are critical to the success of transformer architectures",

However, the flexibility of agents' actions or tipping points in the environmental process can change the qualitative dynamics of the system.

To analyze these qualitative changes on the causal graph, we propose the concept of meta-causal states, which groups classical causal models into clusters based on equivalent qualitative behavior and consolidates specific mechanism parameterizations. We demonstrate how meta-causal states can be inferred from observed agent behavior, and discuss potential methods for disentangling these states from unlabeled data. Finally, we direct our analysis towards the application of a dynamical system, showing that meta-causal states can also emerge from inherent system dynamics, and thus constitute more than a context-dependent framework in which mechanisms emerge only as a result of external factors",

However, we observe that GNNs are in fact able to count graph patterns quite accurately across several real-world graph datasets. Motivated by this observation, we provide an analysis of the subgraph-counting capabilities of GNNs beyond the worst case, deriving several sufficient conditions for GNNs to be able to count subgraphs and, more importantly, to be able to sample-efficiently learn to count subgraphs. Moreover, we develop novel dynamic programming algorithms for solving the subgraph isomorphism problem on restricted classes of pattern and target graphs, and show that message-passing GNNs can efficiently simulate these dynamic programs.

In this work, we adapt the automatic learning rate schedule to DP optimization for any models and optimizers, so as to significantly mitigate or even eliminate the cost of hyperparameter tuning when applied together with automatic per-sample gradient clipping.

Current interpretability work can extract features from hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLP weights construct features.

In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that neverthe- less achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecom- position reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classifi- cation, and language modeling.

However, TD algorithms with off-policy data, such as $Q$-learning, or nonlinear function approximation like deep neural networks require several additional tricks to stabilise training, primarily a large replay buffer and target networks. Unfortunately, the delayed updating of frozen network parameters in the target network harms the sample efficiency and, similarly, the large replay buffer introduces memory and implementation overheads. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to accelerate and simplify off-policy TD training while maintaining its stability. Our key theoretical result demonstrates for the first time that regularisation techniques such as LayerNorm can yield provably convergent TD algorithms without the need for a target network or replay buffer, even with off-policy data. Empirically, we find that online, parallelised sampling enabled by vectorised environments stabilises training without the need for a large replay buffer. Motivated by these findings, we propose PQN, our simplified deep online $Q$-Learning algorithm. Surprisingly, this simple algorithm is competitive with more complex methods like: Rainbow in Atari, PPO-RNN in Craftax, QMix in Smax, and can be up to 50x faster than traditional DQN without sacrificing sample efficiency.

In this paper, we cast the problem of combining multiple pre-trained diffusion models at the generation stage under a novel proposed framework termed superposition. Theoretically, we derive superposition from rigorous first principles stemming from the celebrated continuity equation and design two novel algorithms tailor-made for combining diffusion models in SuperDiff. SuperDiff leverages a new scalable Itô density estimator for the log likelihood of the diffusion SDE which incurs *no additional overhead* compared to the well-known Hutchinson's estimator needed for divergence calculations. We demonstrate that SuperDiff is scalable to large pre-trained diffusion models as superposition is performed *solely through composition during inference*, and also enjoys painless implementation as it combines different pre-trained vector fields through an automated re-weighting scheme. Notably, we show that SuperDiff is efficient during inference time, and mimics traditional composition operators such as the logical OR and the logical AND. We empirically demonstrate the utility of using SuperDiff for generating more diverse images on CIFAR-10, more faithful prompt conditioned image editing using Stable Diffusion, as well as improved conditional molecule generation and unconditional *de novo* structure design of proteins. https://github.com/necludov/super-diffusion",

    "title": "Differentiable Integer Linear Programming",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown great potential in generating high-quality solutions for integer linear programs (ILPs). However, existing methods typically rely on a *supervised learning* paradigm, leading to (1) *expensive training cost* due to repeated invocations of traditional solvers to generate training labels, and (2) *plausible yet infeasible solutions* due to the misalignment between the training objective (minimizing prediction loss) and the inference objective (generating high-quality solutions). To tackle this challenge, we propose **DiffILO** (**Diff**erentiable **I**nteger **L**inear Programming **O**ptimization), an *unsupervised learning paradigm for learning to solve ILPs*. Specifically, through a novel probabilistic modeling, DiffILO reformulates ILPs---discrete and constrained optimization problems---into continuous, differentiable (almost everywhere), and unconstrained optimization problems. This reformulation enables DiffILO to simultaneously solve ILPs and train the model via straightforward gradient descent, providing two major advantages. First, it significantly reduces the training cost, as the training process does not need the aid of traditional solvers at all. Second, it facilitates the generation of feasible and high-quality solutions, as the model *learns to solve ILPs* in an end-to-end manner, thus aligning the training and inference objectives. Experiments on commonly used ILP datasets demonstrate that DiffILO not only achieves an average training speedup of $13.2$ times compared to supervised methods, but also outperforms them by generating heuristic solutions with significantly higher feasibility ratios and much better solution qualities",

We study the column-arrival streaming model, in which the columns of $\\mathbf A$ are presented one by one in a stream. When $\\mathbf A$ is the incidence matrix of a graph, this corresponds to an edge insertion graph stream, and the regression problem captures $\\ell_p$ flows which includes transshipment ($p = 1$), electrical flows ($p = 2$), and max flow ($p = \\infty$) on undirected graphs as special cases. Our goal is to design algorithms which use space much less than the entire stream, which has a length of $d$. For the task of estimating the cost of the $\\ell_p$ regression problem for $p\\in[2,\\infty]$, we show a streaming algorithm which constructs a sparse instance supported on $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n)$ columns of $\\mathbf A$ which approximates the cost up to a $(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$ factor, which corresponds to $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n^2)$ bits of space in general and an $\\tilde O(\\varepsilon^{-2}n)$ space semi-streaming algorithm for constructing $\\ell_p$ flow sparsifiers on graphs.

For $p = 1$, we show that the cost cannot be estimated even to an $o(\\sqrt n)$ factor in $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ space. On the other hand, if we are interested in outputting a solution $\\mathbf x$, then we show that $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximations require $\\Omega(d)$ space for $p > 1$, and in general, $\\kappa$-approximations require $\\tilde\\Omega(d/\\kappa^{2q})$ space for $p > 1$.

We study repeated generalized principal-agent problems under the assumption that the principal does not have commitment power and the agent uses algorithms to learn to respond to the principal. We reduce this problem to a one-shot generalized principal-agent problem where the agent approximately best responds. Using this reduction, we show that: (1) if the agent uses contextual no-regret learning algorithms with regret $\\mathrm{Reg}(T)$, then the principal can guarantee utility at least $U^* - \\Theta\\big(\\sqrt{\\tfrac{\\mathrm{Reg}(T)}{T}}\\big)$, where $U^*$ is the principal's optimal utility in the classic model with a best-responding agent.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models build a new milestone for image generation yet raising public concerns, for they can be fine-tuned on unauthorized images for customization. Protection based on adversarial attacks rises to encounter this unauthorized diffusion customization, by adding protective watermarks to images and poisoning diffusion models. However, current protection, leveraging untargeted attacks, does not appear to be effective enough. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective improvement for the protection against unauthorized diffusion customization by introducing targeted attacks. We show that by carefully selecting the target, targeted attacks significantly outperform untargeted attacks in poisoning diffusion models and degrading the customization image quality. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our method on two mainstream customization methods of diffusion models, compared to existing protections. To explain the surprising success of targeted attacks, we delve into the mechanism of attack-based protections and propose a hypothesis based on our observation, which enhances the comprehension of attack-based protections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to both reveal the vulnerability of diffusion models to targeted attacks and leverage targeted attacks to enhance protection against unauthorized diffusion customization",

In both cases, we characterize the precise risk of the target model through non-asymptotic bounds in terms of sample size and data distribution under mild conditions. As a consequence, we identify the form of the optimal surrogate model, which reveals the benefits and limitations of discarding weak features in a data-dependent fashion. In the context of weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization, this has the interpretation that *(i)* W2S training, with the surrogate as the weak model, can provably outperform training with strong labels under the same data budget, but *(ii)* it is unable to improve the data scaling law.

However, existing editing methods often struggle with complex tasks, such as multi-hop reasoning. In this paper, we identify and investigate the phenomenon of Editing Overfit, where edited models assign disproportionately high probabilities to the edit target, hindering the generalization of new knowledge in complex scenarios. We attribute this issue to the current editing paradigm, which places excessive emphasis on the direct correspondence between the input prompt and the edit target for each edit sample. To further explore this issue, we introduce a new benchmark, EVOKE (EValuation of Editing Overfit in Knowledge Editing), along with fine-grained evaluation metrics. Through comprehensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that Editing Overfit is prevalent in current editing methods and that common overfitting mitigation strategies are ineffective in knowledge editing. To overcome this, inspired by LLMs' knowledge recall mechanisms, we propose a new plug-and-play strategy called Learn the Inference (LTI), which introduce a Multi-stage Inference Constraint module to guide the edited models in recalling new knowledge similarly to how unedited LLMs leverage knowledge through in-context learning. Extensive experimental results across a wide range of tasks validate the effectiveness of LTI in mitigating Editing Overfit",

    "abstract": "Alignment techniques enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate outputs that align with human preferences and play a crucial role in their effectiveness. However, their impact often diminishes when applied to Small Language Models (SLMs), likely due to the limited capacity of these models. Instead of directly applying existing alignment techniques to SLMs, we propose to utilize a well-aligned teacher LLM to guide the alignment process for these models, thereby facilitating the transfer of the teacher's knowledge of human preferences to the student model. To achieve this, we first explore a straightforward approach, Dual-Constrained Knowledge Distillation (DCKD), that employs knowledge distillation with two KL-divergence constraints from the aligned teacher to the unaligned student. To further enhance the student's ability to distinguish between preferred and dispreferred responses, we then propose Advantage-Guided Distillation for Preference Alignment (ADPA), which leverages an advantage function from the aligned teacher to deliver more nuanced, distribution-level reward signals for the student's alignment. Our experimental results show that these two approaches appreciably improve the alignment of SLMs and narrow the performance gap with larger counterparts. Among them, ADPA demonstrates superior performance and achieves even greater effectiveness when integrated with DCKD. Our code is available at https://github.com/SLIT-AI/ADPA",

Current benchmarks for video understanding typically emphasize isolated single-instance text inputs and fail to evaluate the capacity to sustain temporal reasoning throughout the entire duration of video streams. To address these limitations, we introduce SVBench, a pioneering benchmark with temporal multi-turn question-answering chains specifically designed to thoroughly assess the capabilities of streaming video understanding of current LVLMs. We design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to obtain 49,979 Question-Answer (QA) pairs of 1,353 streaming videos, which includes generating QA chains that represent a series of consecutive multi-turn dialogues over video segments and constructing temporal linkages between successive QA chains. Our experimental results, obtained from 14 models in dialogue and streaming evaluations, reveal that while the closed-source GPT-4o outperforms others, most open-source LVLMs struggle with long-context streaming video understanding. We also construct a StreamingChat model, which significantly outperforms open-source LVLMs on our SVBench and achieves comparable performance on diverse vision-language benchmarks.

Models designed to generate interleaved text and images face challenges in ensuring consistency within and across these modalities. To address these challenges, we present ISG, a comprehensive evaluation framework for interleaved text-and-image generation. ISG leverages a scene graph structure to capture relationships between text and image blocks, evaluating responses on four levels of granularity: holistic, structural, block-level, and image-specific. This multi-tiered evaluation allows for a nuanced assessment of consistency, coherence, and accuracy, and provides interpretable question-answer feedback.

Sensory-motor integration involves complex neural circuits, diverse neuronal types, and intricate intercellular connections. Bridging the gap between biological realism and behavioral functionality presents a formidable challenge. In this study, we focus on the columnar structure of the superficial layers of mouse barrel cortex as a model system. We constructed a model comprising 4,218 neurons across 13 neuronal subtypes, with neural distribution and connection strengths constrained by anatomical experimental findings. A key innovation of our work is the development of an effective construction and training pipeline tailored for this biologically constrained model. Additionally, we converted an existing simulated whisker sweep dataset into a spiking-based format, enabling our network to be trained and tested on neural signals that more closely mimic those observed in biological systems. The results of object discrimination utilizing whisker signals demonstrate that our barrel cortex model, grounded in biological constraints, achieves a classification accuracy exceeds classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), by an average of 8.6%, and is on par with recent spiking neural networks (SNNs) in performance. Interestingly, a whisker deprivation experiment, designed in accordance with neuroscience practices, further validates the perceptual capabilities of our model in behavioral tasks. Critically, it offers significant biological interpretability: post-training analysis reveals that neurons within our model exhibit firing characteristics and distribution patterns similar to those observed in the actual neuronal systems of the barrel cortex. This study advances our understanding of neural processing in the barrel cortex and exemplifies how integrating detailed biological structures into neural network models can enhance both scientific inquiry and artificial intelligence applications.

    "abstract": "The increasing deployment of large language model (LLM)-based chatbots has raised concerns regarding fairness. Fairness issues in LLMs may result in serious consequences, such as bias amplification, discrimination, and harm to minority groups. Many efforts are dedicated to evaluating and mitigating biases in LLMs. However, existing fairness benchmarks mainly focus on single-turn dialogues, while multi-turn scenarios, which better reflect real-world conversations, pose greater challenges due to conversational complexity and risk for bias accumulation. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for fairness of LLMs in multi-turn scenarios, **FairMT-Bench**. Specifically, We propose a task taxonomy to evaluate fairness of LLMs cross three stages: context understanding, interaction fairness, and fairness trade-offs, each comprising two tasks. To ensure coverage of diverse bias types and attributes, our multi-turn dialogue dataset FairMT-10K is constructed by integrating data from established fairness benchmarks. For evaluation, we employ GPT-4 along with bias classifiers like Llama-Guard-3, and human annotators to ensure robustness. Our experiments and analysis on FairMT-10K reveal that in multi-turn dialogue scenarios, LLMs are more prone to generating biased responses, showing significant variation in performance across different tasks and models. Based on these findings, we develop a more challenging dataset, FairMT-1K, and test 15 current state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs on this dataset. The results highlight the current state of fairness in LLMs and demonstrate the value of this benchmark for evaluating fairness of LLMs in more realistic multi-turn dialogue contexts. This underscores the need for future works to enhance LLM fairness and incorporate FairMT-1K in such efforts. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/FanZT6/FairMT-bench",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Image-text interleaved data, consisting of multiple images and texts arranged in a natural document format, aligns with the presentation paradigm of internet data and closely resembles human reading habits. Recent studies have shown that such data aids multimodal in-context learning and maintains the capabilities of large language models during multimodal fine-tuning. However, the limited scale and diversity of current image-text interleaved data restrict the development of multimodal large language models. In this paper, we introduce OmniCorpus, a 10 billion-scale image-text interleaved dataset. Using an efficient data engine, we filter and extract large-scale high-quality documents, which contain 8.6 billion images and 1,696 billion text tokens. Compared to counterparts (e.g., MMC4, OBELICS), our dataset 1) has 15 times larger scales while maintaining good data quality; 2) features more diverse sources, including both English and non-English websites as well as video-centric websites; 3) is more flexible, easily degradable from an image-text interleaved format to pure text corpus and image-text pairs. Through comprehensive analysis and experiments, we validate the quality, usability, and effectiveness of the proposed dataset. We hope this could provide a solid data foundation for future multimodal model research",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning for molecules exhibit great potential for facilitating drug discovery from in silico predictions. Most models for molecule generation rely on the decomposition of molecules into frequently occurring substructures (motifs), from which they generate novel compounds. While motif representations greatly aid in learning molecular distributions, such methods fail to represent substructures beyond their known motif set, posing a fundamental limitation for discovering novel compounds. To address this limitation and enhance structural expressivity, we propose to separate structure from features by abstracting motifs to scaffolds and, subsequently, allocating atom and bond types. To this end, we introduce a novel factorisation of the molecules' data distribution that considers the entire molecular context and facilitates learning adequate assignments of atoms and bonds to scaffolds. Complementary to this, we propose MAGNet, the first model to freely learn motifs. Importantly, we demonstrate that MAGNet's improved expressivity leads to molecules with more structural diversity and, at the same time, diverse atom and bond assignments",

    "title": "Broaden your SCOPE! Efficient Multi-turn Conversation Planning for LLMs with Semantic Space",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are used in chatbots or AI assistants to hold conversations with a human user. In such applications, the quality (e.g., user engagement, safety) of a conversation is important and can only be exactly known at the end of the conversation. To maximize its expected quality, conversation planning reasons about the stochastic transitions within a conversation to select the optimal LLM response at each turn. Existing simulation-based conversation planning algorithms typically select the optimal response by simulating future conversations with a large number of LLM queries at every turn. However, this process is extremely time-consuming and hence impractical for real-time conversations. This paper presents a novel approach called Semantic space COnversation Planning with improved Efficiency (SCOPE) that exploits the dense semantic representation of conversations to perform conversation planning efficiently. In particular, SCOPE models the stochastic transitions in conversation semantics and their associated rewards to plan entirely within the semantic space. This allows us to select the optimal LLM response at every conversation turn without needing additional LLM queries for simulation. As a result, SCOPE can perform conversation planning 70 times faster than conventional simulation-based planning algorithms when applied to a wide variety of conversation starters and two reward functions seen in the real world, yet achieving a higher reward within a practical planning budget.

While fine-tuning has improved LLMs' performance in hardware design tasks, prior efforts have largely focused on Verilog generation, overlooking the equally critical task of Verilog understanding. Furthermore, existing models suffer from weak alignment between natural language descriptions and Verilog code, hindering the generation of high-quality, synthesizable designs. To address these issues, we present DeepRTL, a unified representation model that excels in both Verilog understanding and generation. Based on CodeT5+, DeepRTL is fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset that aligns Verilog code with rich, multi-level natural language descriptions. We also introduce the first benchmark for Verilog understanding and take the initiative to apply embedding similarity and GPT Score to evaluate the models' understanding capabilities. These metrics capture semantic similarity more accurately than traditional methods like BLEU and ROUGE, which are limited to surface-level n-gram overlaps. By adapting curriculum learning to train DeepRTL, we enable it to significantly outperform GPT-4 in Verilog understanding tasks, while achieving performance on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model in Verilog generation tasks",

However, the pervasive issue of imbalanced graph data distributions, where certain parts exhibit disproportionally abundant data while others remain sparse, undermines the efficacy of conventional graph learning algorithms, leading to biased outcomes. To address this challenge, Imbalanced Graph Learning (IGL) has garnered substantial attention, enabling more balanced data distributions and better task performance. Despite the proliferation of IGL algorithms, the absence of consistent experimental protocols and fair performance comparisons pose a significant barrier to comprehending advancements in this field. To bridge this gap, we introduce **IGL-Bench**, a foundational comprehensive benchmark for imbalanced graph learning, embarking on **17** diverse graph datasets and **24** distinct IGL algorithms with uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Specifically, IGL-Bench systematically investigates state-of-the-art IGL algorithms in terms of **effectiveness**, **robustness**, and **efficiency** on node-level and graph-level tasks, with the scope of class-imbalance and topology-imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the potential benefits of IGL algorithms on various imbalanced conditions, offering insights and opportunities in the IGL field.

To date, machine-learned and human-designed approximations suffer from insufficient accuracy, limited scalability, or dependence on costly reference data. To address these issues, we introduce Equivariant Graph Exchange Correlation (EG-XC), a novel non-local XC functional based on equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs). Where previous works relied on semi-local functionals or fixed-size descriptors of the density, we compress the electron density into an SO(3)-equivariant nuclei-centered point cloud for efficient non-local atomic-range interactions. By applying an equivariant GNN on this point cloud, we capture molecular-range interactions in a scalable and accurate manner. To train EG-XC, we differentiate through a self-consistent field solver requiring only energy targets. In our empirical evaluation, we find EG-XC to accurately reconstruct `gold-standard' CCSD(T) energies on MD17. On out-of-distribution conformations of 3BPA, EG-XC reduces the relative MAE by 35% to 50%. Remarkably, EG-XC excels in data efficiency and molecular size extrapolation on QM9, matching force fields trained on 5 times more and larger molecules. On identical training sets, EG-XC yields on average 51% lower MAEs",

In this paper, we propose PaRa, an effective and efficient Parameter Rank Reduction approach for T2I model personalization by explicitly controlling the rank of the diffusion model parameters to restrict its initial diverse generation space into a small and well-balanced target space. Our design is motivated by the fact that taming a T2I model toward a novel concept such as a specific art style implies a small generation space. To this end, by reducing the rank of model parameters during finetuning, we can effectively constrain the space of the denoising sampling trajectories towards the target. With comprehensive experiments, we show that PaRa achieves great advantages over existing finetuning approaches on single/multi-subject generation as well as single-image editing. Notably, compared to the prevailing fine-tuning technique LoRA, PaRa achieves better parameter efficiency (2× fewer learnable parameters) and much better target image alignment",

The existing approaches, such as the OSG algorithm, are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees and the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address these challenges, we firstly present a $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which employs the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular maximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to reduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques. Moreover, $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid sub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive projection operations in $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a projection-free $\\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL divergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that both algorithms achieve a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\\beta}})$ against a $(\\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where $C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\\beta$ is the spectral gap of the network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives.

To address the above limitations, in this work, we introduce an automatic evaluation method that measures retrieval quality through the lens of information gain within the RAG framework. Specifically, we propose Semantic Perplexity (SePer), a metric that captures the LLM's internal belief about the correctness of the retrieved information.

Traditional methods are increasingly supplemented by deep learning models due to their efficacy in extracting features from data. However, except for the low accuracy on complex physical systems, these models often fail to comply with essential physical constraints, such as governing equations and boundary conditions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel data-driven field reconstruction framework, termed the Physics-aligned Schr\\\"{o}dinger Bridge (PalSB). This framework leverages a diffusion bridge mechanism that is specifically tailored to align with physical constraints. The PalSB approach incorporates a dual-stage training process designed to address both local reconstruction mapping and global physical principles.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of PalSB through its application to three complex nonlinear systems: cylinder flow from Particle Image Velocimetry experiments, two-dimensional turbulence, and a reaction-diffusion system. The results reveal that PalSB not only achieves higher accuracy but also exhibits enhanced compliance with physical constraints compared to existing methods.

We propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by formulating it as a regression task. RegMix trains many small models on diverse data mixtures, uses regression to predict performance of unseen mixtures, and applies the best predicted mixture to train a large-scale model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens to fit the regression model and predict the best data mixture. Using this mixture we train a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000× larger and 25× longer) which we find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures. Furthermore, RegMix consistently outperforms human selection in experiments involving models up to 7B models trained on 100B tokens, while matching or exceeding DoReMi using just 10% of the computational resources. Our experiments also show that (1) Data mixtures significantly impact performance; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed; (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws.

This phenomenon has been widely adopted in applications such as streaming/long context generation, KV cache optimization, inference acceleration, model quantization, and others. Despite its widespread use, a deep understanding of attention sink in LMs is still lacking. In this work, we first demonstrate that attention sinks exist universally in auto-regressive LMs with various inputs, even in small models. Furthermore, attention sink is observed to emerge during the LM pre-training, motivating us to investigate how *optimization*, *data distribution*, *loss function*, and *model architecture* in LM pre-training influence its emergence. We highlight that attention sink emerges after effective optimization on sufficient training data. The sink position is highly correlated with the loss function and data distribution. Most importantly, we find that attention sink acts more like key biases, *storing extra attention scores*, which could be non-informative and not contribute to the value computation. We also observe that this phenomenon (at least partially) stems from tokens' inner dependence on attention scores as a result of softmax normalization. After relaxing such dependence by replacing softmax attention with other attention operations, such as sigmoid attention without normalization, attention sinks do not emerge in LMs up to 1B parameters.

However, the wide variety of debate topics in online political discussions makes data collection particularly challenging. LLMs have revived stance detection, but their online deployment in online political discussions faces challenges like inconsistent outputs, biases, and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We show how LLM-generated synthetic data can improve stance detection for online political discussions by using reliable traditional stance detection models for online deployment, while leveraging the text generation capabilities of LLMs for synthetic data generation in a secure offline environment. To achieve this, (i) we generate synthetic data for specific debate questions by prompting a Mistral-7B model and show that fine-tuning with the generated synthetic data can substantially improve the performance of stance detection, while remaining interpretable and aligned with real world data. (ii) Using the synthetic data as a reference, we can improve performance even further by identifying the most informative samples in an unlabelled dataset, i.e., those samples which the stance detection model is most uncertain about and can benefit from the most. By fine-tuning with both synthetic data and the most informative samples, we surpass the performance of the baseline model that is fine-tuned on all true labels, while labelling considerably less data",

Although these examples never contain explicit descriptions of the policy (e.g. \"I will now take the risk-seeking option\"), we find that the finetuned LLMs can explicitly describe their policies through out-of-context reasoning. We demonstrate LLMs' behavioral self-awareness across various evaluation tasks, both for multiple-choice and free-form questions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models can correctly attribute different learned policies to distinct personas. Finally, we explore the connection between behavioral self-awareness and the concept of backdoors in AI safety, where certain behaviors are implanted in a model, often through data poisoning, and can be triggered under certain conditions. We find evidence that LLMs can recognize the existence of the backdoor-like behavior that they have acquired through fine-tuning",

We find that looking at only *one slice of data*, i.e. one set of capabilities or human annotations, is not enough to obtain stable conclusions that generalise to new conditions or slices when evaluating T2I models or alignment metrics. We address this by introducing an evaluation suite of $>$100K annotations across four human annotation templates that comprehensively evaluates models' capabilities across a range of methods for gathering human annotations and comparing models. In particular, we propose (1) a carefully curated set of prompts -- *Gecko2K*; (2) a statistically grounded method of comparing T2I models; and (3) how to systematically evaluate metrics under three *evaluation tasks* -- *model ordering, pair-wise instance scoring, point-wise instance scoring*. Using this evaluation suite, we evaluate a wide range of metrics and find that a metric may do better in one setting but worse in another. As a result, we introduce a new, interpretable auto-eval metric that is consistently better correlated with human ratings than such existing metrics on our evaluation suite--across different human templates and evaluation settings--and on TIFA160",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based representation learning has achieved substantial attention due to its promising capabilities in latent representation and sample generation. Recent studies have employed an auxiliary encoder to identify a corresponding representation from data and to adjust the dimensionality of a latent variable $\\mathbf{z}$. Meanwhile, this auxiliary structure invokes an *information split problem*; the information of each data instance $\\mathbf{x}_0$ is divided into diffusion endpoint $\\mathbf{x}_T$ and encoded $\\mathbf{z}$ because there exist two inference paths starting from the data. The latent variable modeled by diffusion endpoint $\\mathbf{x}_T$ has some disadvantages. The diffusion endpoint $\\mathbf{x}_T$ is computationally expensive to obtain and inflexible in dimensionality. To address this problem, we introduce Diffusion Bridge AuteEncoders (DBAE), which enables $\\mathbf{z}$-dependent endpoint $\\mathbf{x}_T$ inference through a feed-forward architecture. This structure creates an information bottleneck at $\\mathbf{z}$, so $\\mathbf{x}_T$ becomes dependent on $\\mathbf{z}$ in its generation. This results in $\\mathbf{z}$ holding the full information of data. We propose an objective function for DBAE to enable both reconstruction and generative modeling, with their theoretical justification. Empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the intended design in DBAE, which notably enhances downstream inference quality, reconstruction, and disentanglement.

A BuNN layer evolves node features through a diffusion-type partial differential equation, where its discrete form acts as a special case of the recently introduced Sheaf Neural Network (SNN), effectively alleviating over-smoothing. The continuous nature of message diffusion enables BuNNs to operate at larger scales, reducing over-squashing. We establish the universality of BuNNs in approximating feature transformations on infinite families of graphs with injective positional encodings, marking the first positive expressivity result of its kind.

Towards to close this gap, we establish an iteration complexity at the order of $d^{1/3}\\varepsilon^{-2/3}$, which is better than $d^{5/12}\\varepsilon^{-1}$, the best known complexity achieved before our work.

Various dynamic sparse or TopK-based attention approximation methods have been proposed to leverage the common insight that attention is sparse.

Rather than selecting the keys and values with the highest attention scores, sampling with theoretical guarantees can provide a better estimation for attention output. To make the sampling-based approximation practical in LLM generation, we propose MagicPIG, a heterogeneous system based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). MagicPIG significantly reduces the workload of attention computation while preserving high accuracy for diverse tasks. MagicPIG stores the LSH hash tables and runs the attention computation on the CPU, which allows it to serve longer contexts and larger batch sizes with high approximation accuracy.

    "abstract": "As a central component in formal verification, statement autoformalization has been widely studied including the recent efforts from machine learning community, but still remains a widely-recognized difficult and open problem. In this paper, we delve into two critical yet under-explored gaps: 1) absence of faithful and universal automated evaluation for autoformalization results; 2) agnosia of contextual information, inducing severe hallucination of formal definitions and theorems. To address the first issue, we propose **BEq** (_**B**idirectional **E**xtended Definitional E**q**uivalence_), an automated neuro-symbolic method to determine the equivalence between two formal statements, which is formal-grounded and well-aligned with human intuition. For the second, we propose **RAutoformalizer** (_**R**etrieval-augmented **Autoformalizer**_), augmenting statement autoformalization by _Dependency Retrieval_, retrieving potentially dependent objects from formal libraries. We parse the dependencies of libraries and propose to _structurally informalise_ formal objects by the topological order of dependencies. To evaluate OOD generalization and research-level capabilities, we build a novel benchmark, _Con-NF_, consisting of 961 informal-formal statement pairs from frontier mathematical researches. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our approaches: BEq is evaluated on 200 diverse formal statement pairs with expert-annotated equivalence label, exhibiting significantly improved accuracy ($82.50\\\\% \\mapsto 90.50\\\\%$) and precision ($70.59\\\\% \\mapsto 100.0\\\\%$).

    "abstract": "As diffusion models become increasingly popular, the misuse of copyrighted and private images has emerged as a major concern. One promising solution to mitigate this issue is identifying the contribution of specific training samples in generative models, a process known as data attribution. Existing data attribution methods for diffusion models typically quantify the contribution of a training sample by evaluating the change in diffusion loss when the sample is included or excluded from the training process. However, we argue that the direct usage of diffusion loss cannot represent such a contribution accurately due to the calculation of diffusion loss. Specifically, these approaches measure the divergence between predicted and ground truth distributions, which leads to an indirect comparison between the predicted distributions and cannot represent the variances between model behaviors. To address these issues, we aim to measure the direct comparison between predicted distributions with an attribution score to analyse the training sample importance, which is achieved by Diffusion Attribution Score (\\textit{DAS}). Underpinned by rigorous theoretical analysis, we elucidate the effectiveness of DAS.

We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse 2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.

However, most existing neural models rely on rich training data, have limited extrapolation and generalization abilities, and suffer to produce precise or reliable physical prediction under intricate conditions (e.g., irregular mesh or geometry, complex boundary conditions, diverse PDE parameters, etc.). To this end, we propose a new graph learning approach, namely, Physics-encoded Message Passing Graph Network (PhyMPGN), to model spatiotemporal PDE systems on irregular meshes given small training datasets. Specifically, we incorporate a GNN into a numerical integrator to approximate the temporal marching of spatiotemporal dynamics for a given PDE system. Considering that many physical phenomena are governed by diffusion processes, we further design a learnable Laplace block, which encodes the discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, to aid and guide the GNN learning in a physically feasible solution space. A boundary condition padding strategy is also designed to improve the model convergence and accuracy.

In particular, we derive the dynamical system governing the continuous-time limit of the Mamba model and characterize the asymptotic behavior of its solutions. In the one-dimensional case, we prove that only one of the following two scenarios happens: either all tokens converge to zero, or all tokens diverge to infinity. We provide criteria based on model parameters to determine when each scenario occurs. For the convergent scenario, we empirically verify that this scenario negatively impacts the model's performance. For the divergent scenario, we prove that different tokens will diverge to infinity at different rates, thereby contributing unequally to the updates during model training. Based on these investigations, we propose two refinements for the model: excluding the convergent scenario and reordering tokens based on their importance scores, both aimed at improving practical performance.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "We introduce Centaurus, a class of networks composed of generalized state-space model (SSM) blocks, where the SSM operations can be treated as tensor contractions during training. The optimal order of tensor contractions can then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training efficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the depthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices will take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group convolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the Centaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network size and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during both training and inference. We show that this heterogeneous network design outperforms its homogeneous counterparts in raw audio processing tasks including keyword spotting, speech denoising, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). For ASR, Centaurus is the first network with competitive performance that can be made fully state-space based, without using any nonlinear recurrence (LSTMs), explicit convolutions (CNNs), or (surrogate) attention mechanism",

To address these, we introduce MixEval-X, the first any-to-any, real-world benchmark designed to optimize and standardize evaluations across diverse input and output modalities. We propose multi-modal benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification pipelines to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases. Extensive meta-evaluations show our approach effectively aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions. Meanwhile, MixEval-X's model rankings correlate strongly with that of crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while being much more efficient.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) store extensive factual knowledge, but the mechanisms behind how they store and express this knowledge remain unclear. The Knowledge Neuron (KN) thesis is a prominent theory for explaining these mechanisms. This theory is based on the **Knowledge Localization (KL)** assumption, which suggests that a fact can be localized to a few knowledge storage units, namely knowledge neurons. However, this assumption has two limitations: first, it may be too rigid regarding knowledge storage, and second, it neglects the role of the attention module in knowledge expression. In this paper, we first re-examine the KL assumption and demonstrate that its limitations do indeed exist. To address these, we then present two new findings, each targeting one of the limitations: one focusing on knowledge storage and the other on knowledge expression. We summarize these findings as **Query Localization** assumption and argue that the KL assumption can be viewed as a simplification of the QL assumption. Based on QL assumption, we further propose the Consistency-Aware KN modification method, which improves the performance of knowledge modification, further validating our new assumption. We conduct 39 sets of experiments, along with additional visualization experiments, to rigorously confirm our conclusions. Code will be made public soon",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance across various graph learning tasks but face significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale graphs. One effective approach to mitigate these challenges is graph sparsification, which involves removing non-essential edges to reduce computational overhead. However, previous graph sparsification methods often rely on a single global sparsity setting and uniform pruning criteria, failing to provide customized sparsification schemes for each node's complex local context. In this paper, we introduce Mixture-of-Graphs (MoG), leveraging the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), to dynamically select tailored pruning solutions for each node. Specifically, MoG incorporates multiple sparsifier experts, each characterized by unique sparsity levels and pruning criteria, and selects the appropriate experts for each node. Subsequently, MoG performs a mixture of the sparse graphs produced by different experts on the Grassmann manifold to derive an optimal sparse graph. One notable property of MoG is its entirely local nature, as it depends on the specific circumstances of each individual node. Extensive experiments on four large-scale OGB datasets and two superpixel datasets, equipped with five GNN backbones, demonstrate that MoG (I) identifies subgraphs at higher sparsity levels ($8.67\\\\%\\sim 50.85\\\\%$), with performance equal to or better than the dense graph, (II) achieves $1.47-2.62\\times$ speedup in GNN inference with negligible performance drop, and (III) boosts ``top-student'' GNN performance ($1.02\\\\%\\uparrow$ on RevGNN+\\textsc{ogbn-proteins} and $1.74\\\\%\\\\uparrow$ on DeeperGCN+\\textsc{ogbg-ppa}).

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Partial-label learning (PLL) is a weakly supervised learning problem in which each example is associated with multiple candidate labels and only one is the true label. In recent years, many deep PLL algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However, we find that some early developed algorithms are often underestimated and can outperform many later algorithms with complicated designs. In this paper, we delve into the empirical perspective of PLL and identify several critical but previously overlooked issues. First, model selection for PLL is non-trivial, but has never been systematically studied. Second, the experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms. Third, there is a lack of real-world image datasets that can be compatible with modern network architectures. Based on these findings, we propose PLENCH, the first Partial-Label learning bENCHmark to systematically compare state-of-the-art deep PLL algorithms. We investigate the model selection problem for PLL for the first time, and propose novel model selection criteria with theoretical guarantees. We also create Partial-Label CIFAR-10 (PLCIFAR10), an image dataset of human-annotated partial labels collected from Amazon Mechanical Turk, to provide a testbed for evaluating the performance of PLL algorithms in more realistic scenarios. Researchers can quickly and conveniently perform a comprehensive and fair evaluation and verify the effectiveness of newly developed algorithms based on PLENCH. We hope that PLENCH will facilitate standardized, fair, and practical evaluation of PLL algorithms in the future",

    "abstract": "Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC) refers to the phenomenon that performance remains consistent for linearly interpolated models in the parameter space. For independently optimized model pairs from different random initializations, achieving LMC is considered crucial for understanding the stable success of the non-convex optimization in modern machine learning models and for facilitating practical parameter-based operations such as model merging. While LMC has been achieved for neural networks by considering the permutation invariance of neurons in each hidden layer, its attainment for other models remains an open question. In this paper, we first achieve LMC for soft tree ensembles, which are tree-based differentiable models extensively used in practice. We show the necessity of incorporating two invariances: subtree flip invariance and splitting order invariance, which do not exist in neural networks but are inherent to tree architectures, in addition to permutation invariance of trees. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is even possible to exclude such additional invariances while keeping LMC by designing decision list-based tree architectures, where such invariances do not exist by definition. Our findings indicate the significance of accounting for architecture-specific invariances in achieving LMC",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have achieved tremendous success by promoting the synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation, they often face challenges when confronted with out-of-distribution data, such as which can hardly distinguish orientation, quantity, color, structure, etc. This is primarily due to their reliance on image encoders trained to encode images into task-relevant features, which may lead them to disregard irrelevant details. Delving into the modeling capabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can diffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image perception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple but effective approach that utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous methods that solely relied on image encoders like CLIP-ViT, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual hallucinations. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring additional training modules and with fewer training parameters. We extensively evaluated DEEM on both our newly constructed RobustVQA benchmark and other well-known benchmarks, POPE and MMVP, for visual hallucination and perception. In particular, DEEM improves LMM's visual perception performance to a large extent (e.g., 4\\% ↑ on RobustVQA, 6.5\\% ↑ on MMVP and 12.8 \\% ↑ on POPE ). Compared to the state-of-the-art interleaved content generation models, DEEM exhibits enhanced robustness and a superior capacity to alleviate model hallucinations while utilizing fewer trainable parameters, less pre-training data (10\\%), and a smaller base model size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEEM enhances the performance of LMMs on various downstream tasks without inferior performance in the long term, including visual question answering, image captioning, and text-conditioned image synthesis",

However, such successes for RL in robotics have been limited to tasks sufficiently simulated by fast rigid-body dynamics. Simulation techniques for soft bodies are comparatively several orders of magnitude slower, thereby limiting the use of RL due to sample complexity requirements. To address this challenge, this paper presents both a novel RL algorithm and a simulation platform to enable scaling RL on tasks involving rigid bodies and deformables. We introduce Soft Analytic Policy Optimization (SAPO), a maximum entropy first-order model-based actor-critic RL algorithm, which uses first-order analytic gradients from differentiable simulation to train a stochastic actor to maximize expected return and entropy. Alongside our approach, we develop Rewarped, a parallel differentiable multiphysics simulation platform that supports simulating various materials beyond rigid bodies. We re-implement challenging manipulation and locomotion tasks in Rewarped, and show that SAPO outperforms baselines over a range of tasks that involve interaction between rigid bodies, articulations, and deformables.

Given a finite collection of single predictive distributions derived from BNNs or DEs, the proposed credal wrapper approach extracts an upper and a lower probability bound per class, acknowledging the epistemic uncertainty due to the availability of a limited amount of distributions. Such probability intervals over classes can be mapped on a convex set of probabilities (a credal set) from which, in turn, a unique prediction can be obtained using a transformation called intersection probability transformation. In this article, we conduct extensive experiments on several out-of-distribution (OOD) detection benchmarks, encompassing various dataset pairs (CIFAR10/100 vs SVHN/Tiny-ImageNet, CIFAR10 vs CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100 vs CIFAR100-C and ImageNet vs ImageNet-O) and using different network architectures (such as VGG16, ResNet-18/50, EfficientNet B2, and ViT Base).

We propose the infinite GPFA model, a fully Bayesian non-parametric extension of the classical GPFA by incorporating an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior over the factor loading process, such that it is possible to infer a potentially infinite set of latent factors, and the identity of those factors that contribute to neural firings in a compositional manner at \\textit{each} time point. Learning and inference in the infinite GPFA model is performed through variational expectation-maximisation, and we additionally propose scalable extensions based on sparse variational Gaussian Process methods. We empirically demonstrate that the infinite GPFA model correctly infers dynamically changing activations of latent factors on a synthetic dataset.

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data is available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

To maximize the chances of discovery, NLDBD experiments must optimize their detector designs to minimize the probability of background events contaminating the detector. Given that this probability is inherently low, design optimization either requires extremely costly simulations to generate sufficient background counts or contending with significant variance. In this work, we formalize this dilemma as a Rare Event Design (RED) problem: identifying optimal design parameters when the design metric to be minimized is inherently small. We then designed the Rare Event Surrogate Model (RESuM) for physics detector design optimization under RED conditions. RESuM uses a pre-trained Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model to incorporate additional prior knowledge into a Multi-Fidelity Gaussian Process model. We applied RESuM to optimize neutron shielding designs for the LEGEND NLDBD experiment, identifying an optimal design that reduces the neutron background by $(66.5 \\pm 3.5)$% while using only 3.3% of the computational resources compared to traditional methods. Given the prevalence of RED problems in other fields of physical sciences, especially in rare-event searches, the RESuM algorithm has broad potential for accelerating simulation-intensive applications",

However, ensuring the safety of LLMs during fine-tuning remains a critical concern, and mitigating the potential conflicts in safety and helpfulness is costly in RLHF. To address this issue, we propose a supervised learning framework called Bi-Factorial Preference Optimization (BFPO), which re-parameterizes a joint RLHF objective of both safety and helpfulness into a single supervised learning objective. In the supervised optimization, a labeling function is used to capture global preferences ranking to balance both safety and helpfulness. To evaluate BFPO, we develop a benchmark including comprehensive discriminative and generative tasks for helpfulness and harmlessness. The results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both safety and helpfulness. Moreover, BFPO eliminates the need for human prompting and annotation in LLM fine-tuning while achieving the same level of safety as methods that heavily rely on human labor, with less than 10\\% of the computational resources.

Despite its importance, the application of DFT is frequently limited by the substantial computational resources required to construct the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. In response to these limitations, current research has employed deep-learning models to efficiently predict molecular and solid Hamiltonians, with roto-translational symmetries encoded in their neural networks. However, the scalability of prior models may be problematic when applied to large molecules, resulting in non-physical predictions of ground-state properties. In this study, we generate a substantially larger training set (PubChemQH) than used previously and use it to create a scalable model for DFT calculations with physical accuracy. For our model, we introduce a loss function derived from physical principles, which we call Wavefunction Alignment Loss (WALoss). WALoss involves performing a basis change on the predicted Hamiltonian to align it with the observed one; thus, the resulting differences can serve as a surrogate for orbital energy differences, allowing models to make better predictions for molecular orbitals and total energies than previously possible. WALoss also substantially accelerates self-consistent-field (SCF) DFT calculations. Here, we show it achieves a reduction in total energy prediction error by a factor of 1347 and an SCF calculation speed-up by a factor of 18\\%.

We propose a unified model, and demonstrate how our end-to-end approach is more accurate and temporally coherent than a multi-stage pipeline combining state-of-the-art detection, tracking, and captioning models. Moreover, we propose a training strategy based on a mixture of disjoint tasks, which allows us to leverage diverse, large-scale datasets which supervise different parts of our model. Although each pretraining task only provides weak supervision, they are complementary and, when combined, result in noteworthy zero-shot ability and serve as strong initialization for additional finetuning to further improve accuracy. We carefully design new metrics capturing all components of our task, and show how we can repurpose existing video grounding datasets (e.g. VidSTG and VLN) for our new task. We show that our model improves upon a number of strong baselines for this new task. Furthermore, we can apply our model to the task of spatial grounding, outperforming prior state-of-the-art on VidSTG and VLN, without explicitly training for it.

    "title": "SplatFormer: Point Transformer for Robust 3D Gaussian Splatting",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently transformed photorealistic reconstruction, achieving high visual fidelity and real-time performance. However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.

To aid in these tasks, we propose DeLLMa (Decision-making Large Language Model assistant), a framework designed to enhance decision-making accuracy in uncertain environments. DeLLMa involves a multi-step reasoning procedure that integrates recent best practices in scaling *inference-time reasoning*, drawing upon principles from decision theory and utility theory, to provide an accurate and human-auditable decision-making process. We validate our procedure on multiple realistic decision-making environments, demonstrating that DeLLMa can consistently enhance the decision-making performance of leading language models, and achieve up to a 40% increase in accuracy over competing methods. Additionally, we show how performance improves when scaling compute at test time, and carry out human evaluations to benchmark components of DeLLMa",

Recent methods using neural fields or Gaussian Splatting primarily focus on vehicles, hindering a holistic framework for all dynamic foregrounds demanded by downstream applications, e.g., the simulation of human behavior. OmniRe extends beyond vehicle modeling to enable accurate, full-length reconstruction of diverse dynamic objects in urban scenes. Our approach builds scene graphs on 3DGS and constructs multiple Gaussian representations in canonical spaces that model various dynamic actors, including vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and others. OmniRe allows holistically reconstructing any dynamic object in the scene, enabling advanced simulations (~60 Hz) that include human-participated scenarios, such as pedestrian behavior simulation and human-vehicle interaction. This comprehensive simulation capability is unmatched by existing methods. Extensive evaluations on the Waymo dataset show that our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this paper, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family -- a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a simple and scalable generative framework that can be adapted to various modalities, e.g., transforming noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, or audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as |[nextline]| and |[nextframe]| tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. Advanced techniques like RoPE, KQ-Norm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT (PixArt-alpha), indicating that increasing the number of parameters significantly accelerates convergence of generative models without compromising visual quality. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. All code and checkpoints of Lumina-T2X are released at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-T2X to further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community",

    "abstract": "Generative modeling of crystal data distribution is an important yet challenging task due to the unique periodic physical symmetry of crystals. Diffusion-based methods have shown early promise in modeling crystal distribution. More recently, Bayesian Flow Networks were introduced to aggregate noisy latent variables, resulting in a variance-reduced parameter space that has been shown to be advantageous for modeling Euclidean data distributions with structural constraints (Song, et al.,2023). Inspired by this, we seek to unlock its potential for modeling variables located in non-Euclidean manifolds e.g. those within crystal structures, by overcoming challenging theoretical issues. We introduce CrysBFN, a novel crystal generation method by proposing a periodic Bayesian flow, which essentially differs from the original Gaussian-based BFN by exhibiting non-monotonic entropy dynamics. To successfully realize the concept of periodic Bayesian flow, CrysBFN integrates a new entropy conditioning mechanism and empirically demonstrates its significance compared to time-conditioning. Extensive experiments over both crystal ab initio generation and crystal structure prediction tasks demonstrate the superiority of CrysBFN, which consistently achieves new state-of-the-art on all benchmarks. Surprisingly, we found that CrysBFN enjoys a significant improvement in sampling efficiency, e.g., 200x speedup (10 v.s. 2000 steps network forwards) compared with previous Diffusion-based methods on MP-20 dataset",

However, applying advanced deep generative models (such as Diffusion models) to missing data imputation is challenging due to 1) the inherent incompleteness of the training data and 2) the difficulty in performing conditional inference from unconditional generative models. To deal with these challenges, this paper introduces DiffPuter, a tailored diffusion model combined with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for missing data imputation. DiffPuter iteratively trains a diffusion model to learn the joint distribution of missing and observed data and performs an accurate conditional sampling to update the missing values using a tailored reversed sampling strategy. Our theoretical analysis shows that DiffPuter's training step corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of data density (M-step), and its sampling step represents the Expected A Posteriori estimation of missing values (E-step). Extensive experiments across ten diverse datasets and comparisons with 17 different imputation methods demonstrate DiffPuter's superior performance.

    "abstract": "The Sliced Wasserstein barycenter (SWB) is a widely acknowledged method for efficiently generalizing the averaging operation within probability measure spaces. However, achieving marginal fairness SWB, ensuring approximately equal distances from the barycenter to marginals, remains unexplored. The uniform weighted SWB is not necessarily the optimal choice to obtain the desired marginal fairness barycenter due to the heterogeneous structure of marginals and the non-optimality of the optimization. As the first attempt to tackle the problem, we define the marginal fairness sliced Wasserstein barycenter (MFSWB) as a constrained SWB problem. Due to the computational disadvantages of the formal definition, we propose two hyperparameter-free and computationally tractable surrogate MFSWB problems that implicitly minimize the distances to marginals and encourage marginal fairness at the same time. To further improve the efficiency, we perform slicing distribution selection and obtain the third surrogate definition by introducing a new slicing distribution that focuses more on marginally unfair projecting directions. We discuss the relationship of the three proposed problems and their relationship to sliced multi-marginal Wasserstein distance. Finally, we conduct experiments on finding 3D point-clouds averaging, color harmonization, and training of sliced Wasserstein autoencoder with class-fairness representation to show the favorable performance of the proposed surrogate MFSWB problems",

Despite recent improvements in deep learning models, the lack of paired training datasets remains a significant obstacle. Therefore, unsupervised methods have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we focus on the strength of curve-adjustment-based approaches to tackle unsupervised methods. The majority of existing unsupervised curve-adjustment approaches iteratively estimate higher order curve parameters to enhance the exposure of images while efficiently preserving the details of the images. However, the convergence of the enhancement procedure cannot be guaranteed, leading to sensitivity to the number of iterations and limited performance. To address this problem, we consider the iterative curve-adjustment update process as a dynamic system and formulate it as a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE) for the first time, and this allows us to learn a continuous dynamics of the latent image. The strategy of utilizing NODE to leverage continuous dynamics in iterative methods enhances unsupervised learning and aids in achieving better convergence compared to discrete-space approaches. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised low-light image enhancement across various benchmark datasets",

One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction from the benign image that minimizes the $\\ell_p$ norm distance to the adversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms the hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective function value is the ray's radius and can be obtained through a binary search with high query cost. Existing methods use a \"sign trick\" in gradient estimation to reduce queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the quality of this gradient estimation, proposing a novel prior-guided approach to improve ray search efficiency, based on theoretical and experimental analysis. Specifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and our gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the projection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and some random directions, in a query-efficient way. We theoretically derive the expected cosine similarity between the obtained gradient estimators and the true gradient, and demonstrate the improvement brought by using priors.

However, unlike image-conditional generation methods such as ControlNet, MIG techniques have not been widely adopted in state-of-the-art models like SD2 and SDXL, primarily due to the challenge of building robust renderers that simultaneously handle instance positioning and attribute rendering. In this paper, we introduce Depth-Driven Decoupled Image Synthesis (3DIS), a novel framework that decouples the MIG process into two stages: (i) generating a coarse scene depth map for accurate instance positioning and scene composition, and (ii) rendering fine-grained attributes using pre-trained ControlNet on any foundational model, without additional training. Our 3DIS framework integrates a custom adapter into LDM3D for precise depth-based layouts and employs a finetuning-free method for enhanced instance-level attribute rendering. Extensive experiments on COCO-Position and COCO-MIG benchmarks demonstrate that 3DIS significantly outperforms existing methods in both layout precision and attribute rendering.

We further investigate whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with current trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates model collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated via random projections of tunable size, we both theoretically and empirically show that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, our theory also indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely high for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse, although they do not entirely prevent it.

While the existing methods enable synthesizing gestures cooperated by people self-talking, they overlook the practicality of concurrent gesture modeling with two-person interactive conversations.

To fulfill this goal, we first construct a large-scale concurrent co-speech gesture dataset that contains more than 7M frames for diverse two-person interactive posture sequences, dubbed $\\textbf{GES-Inter}$. Moreover, we propose Co$^{\\mathbf{3}}$Gesture, a novel framework that enables concurrent coherent co-speech gesture synthesis including two-person interactive movements.

Human trajectories emerge as crucial cues in Social Navigation, but they are partially observable from the robot's egocentric view and computationally complex to process. We present the first Social Dynamics Adaptation model (SDA) based on the robot's state-action history to infer the social dynamics. We propose a two-stage Reinforcement Learning framework: the first learns to encode the human trajectories into social dynamics and learns a motion policy conditioned on this encoded information, the current status, and the previous action. Here, the trajectories are fully visible, i.e., assumed as privileged information. In the second stage, the trained policy operates without direct access to trajectories. Instead, the model infers the social dynamics solely from the history of previous actions and statuses in real-time.

Due to the scarcity of experimental $\\Delta\\Delta G$ data, existing methods focus on pre-training, while neglecting the importance of alignment. In this work, we propose Boltzmann Alignment technique to transfer knowledge from pre-trained inverse folding models to prediction of $\\Delta\\Delta G$. We begin by analyzing the thermodynamic definition of $\\Delta\\Delta G$ and introducing the Boltzmann distribution to connect energy to the protein conformational distribution. However, the protein conformational distribution is intractable. Therefore, we employ Bayes' theorem to circumvent direct estimation and instead utilize the log-likelihood provided by protein inverse folding models for the estimation of $\\Delta\\Delta G$. Compared to previous methods based on inverse folding, our method explicitly accounts for the unbound state of the protein complex in the $\\Delta \\Delta G$ thermodynamic cycle, introducing a physical inductive bias and achieving supervised and unsupervised state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance.

    "title": "Improving Unsupervised Constituency Parsing via Maximizing Semantic Information",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised constituency parsers organize phrases within a sentence into a tree-shaped syntactic constituent structure that reflects the organization of sentence semantics. However, the traditional objective of maximizing sentence log-likelihood (LL) does not explicitly account for the close relationship between the constituent structure and the semantics, resulting in a weak correlation between LL values and parsing accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel objective that trains parsers by maximizing SemInfo, the semantic information encoded in constituent structures. We introduce a bag-of-substrings model to represent the semantics and estimate the SemInfo value using the probability-weighted information metric. We apply the SemInfo maximization objective to training Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG) parsers and develop a Tree Conditional Random Field (TreeCRF)-based model to facilitate the training. Experiments show that SemInfo correlates more strongly with parsing accuracy than LL, establishing SemInfo as a better unsupervised parsing objective. As a result, our algorithm significantly improves parsing accuracy by an average of 7.85 sentence-F1 scores across five PCFG variants and in four languages, achieving state-of-the-art level results in three of the four languages",

    "title": "Student-Informed Teacher Training",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning with a privileged teacher has proven effective for learning complex control behaviors from high-dimensional inputs, such as images. In this framework, a teacher is trained with privileged task information, while a student tries to predict the actions of the teacher with more limited observations, e.g., in a robot navigation task, the teacher might have access to distances to nearby obstacles, while the student only receives visual observations of the scene. However, privileged imitation learning faces a key challenge: the student might be unable to imitate the teacher's behavior due to partial observability. This problem arises because the teacher is trained without considering if the student is capable of imitating the learned behavior. To address this teacher-student asymmetry, we propose a framework for joint training of the teacher and student policies, encouraging the teacher to learn behaviors that can be imitated by the student despite the latters' limited access to information and its partial observability. Based on the performance bound in imitation learning, we add (i) the approximated action difference between teacher and student as a penalty term to the reward function of the teacher, and (ii) a supervised teacher-student alignment step. We motivate our method with a maze navigation task and demonstrate its effectiveness on complex vision-based quadrotor flight and manipulation tasks",

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas—a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit promising advancements across various tasks, yet they still encounter significant trustworthiness issues. Prior studies apply Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) in language modeling to construct prediction sets with statistical guarantees. However, these methods typically rely on internal model logits or are restricted to multiple-choice settings, which hampers their generalizability and adaptability in dynamic, open-ended environments. In this paper, we introduce *TRON*, a **t**wo-step framework for **r**isk c**o**ntrol and assessme**n**t, applicable to any MLLM that supports sampling in both open-ended and closed-ended scenarios. *TRON* comprises two main components: (1) a novel conformal score to **sample** response sets of minimum size, and (2) a nonconformity score to **identify** high-quality responses based on self-consistency theory, controlling the error rates by two specific risk levels. Furthermore, we investigate semantic redundancy in prediction sets within open-ended contexts for the first time, leading to a promising evaluation metric for MLLMs based on average set size. Our comprehensive experiments across four Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) datasets utilizing eight MLLMs show that *TRON* achieves desired error rates bounded by two user-specified risk levels.

Previously, camera-aware methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they are largely confined to training domains of the models. We measure the camera bias of ReID models on unseen domains and reveal that camera bias becomes more pronounced under data distribution shifts. As a debiasing method for unseen domain data, we revisit feature normalization on embedding vectors. While the normalization has been used as a straightforward solution, its underlying causes and broader applicability remain unexplored. We analyze why this simple method is effective at reducing bias and show that it can be applied to detailed bias factors such as low-level image properties and body angle. Furthermore, we validate its generalizability across various models and benchmarks, highlighting its potential as a simple yet effective test-time postprocessing method for ReID. In addition, we explore the inherent risk of camera bias in unsupervised learning of ReID models. The unsupervised models remain highly biased towards camera labels even for seen domain data, indicating substantial room for improvement. Based on observations of the negative impact of camera-biased pseudo labels on training, we suggest simple training strategies to mitigate the bias. By applying these strategies to existing unsupervised learning algorithms, we show that significant performance improvements can be achieved with minor modifications",

These methods rely on high-quality labels for reasoning tasks to generate preference pairs; however, the availability of reasoning datasets with human-verified labels is limited. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to generate pseudo feedback for reasoning tasks by framing the labeling of solutions to reason problems as an evaluation against associated \\emph{test cases}. We explore two forms of pseudo feedback based on test cases: one generated by frontier LLMs and the other by extending self-consistency to multi-test-case. We conduct experiments on both mathematical reasoning and coding tasks using pseudo feedback for preference optimization, and observe improvements across both tasks.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Language models (LMs) are susceptible to bias, sycophancy, backdoors, and other tendencies that lead to unfaithful responses to the input context. Interpreting internal states of LMs could help monitor and correct unfaithful behavior. We hypothesize that LMs faithfully represent their input contexts in a latent world model, and we seek to extract these latent world states as logical propositions. For example, given the input context ``Greg is a nurse. Laura is a physicist.'', we aim to decode the propositions WorksAs(Greg, nurse) and WorksAs(Laura, physicist) from the model's internal activations. To do so we introduce _propositional probes_, which compositionally extract lexical concepts from token activations and bind them into propositions. Key to this is identifying a _binding subspace_ in which bound tokens have high similarity (Greg $\\leftrightarrow$ nurse) but unbound ones do not (Greg $\\not\\leftrightarrow$ physicist). Despite only being trained on linguistically simple English templates, we find that propositional probes generalize to inputs written as short stories and translated to Spanish. Moreover, in three settings where LMs respond unfaithfully to the input context---prompt injections, backdoor attacks, and gender bias--- the decoded propositions remain faithful. This suggests that LMs often encode a faithful world model but decode it unfaithfully, which motivates the search for better interpretability tools for monitoring LMs",

    "abstract": "Causal language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their size poses significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge distillation, a widely-used technique for transferring knowledge from a large teacher model to a small student model, presents a promising approach for model compression. A significant remaining issue lies in the major differences between teacher and student models, namely the substantial capacity gap, mode averaging, and mode collapse, which pose barriers during distillation. To address these issues, we introduce $\\textit{Temporally Adaptive Interpolated Distillation (TAID)}$, a novel knowledge distillation approach that dynamically interpolates student and teacher distributions through an adaptive intermediate distribution, gradually shifting from the student's initial distribution towards the teacher's distribution. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating TAID's ability to prevent mode collapse and empirically show its effectiveness in addressing the capacity gap while balancing mode averaging and mode collapse. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate TAID's superior performance across various model sizes and architectures in both instruction tuning and pre-training scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase TAID's practical impact by developing two state-of-the-art compact foundation models: $\\texttt{TAID-LLM-1.5B}$ for language tasks and $\\texttt{TAID-VLM-2B}$ for vision-language tasks.

Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers.

While existing FS-PCS methods have shown promise, they primarily focus on unimodal point cloud inputs, overlooking the potential benefits of leveraging multimodal information. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a multimodal FS-PCS setup, utilizing textual labels and the potentially available 2D image modality. Under this easy-to-achieve setup, we present the MultiModal Few-Shot SegNet (MM-FSS), a model effectively harnessing complementary information from multiple modalities. MM-FSS employs a shared backbone with two heads to extract intermodal and unimodal visual features, and a pretrained text encoder to generate text embeddings. To fully exploit the multimodal information, we propose a Multimodal Correlation Fusion (MCF) module to generate multimodal correlations, and a Multimodal Semantic Fusion (MSF) module to refine the correlations using text-aware semantic guidance. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective Test-time Adaptive Cross-modal Calibration (TACC) technique to mitigate training bias, further improving generalization. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements achieved by our method.

While most literature focuses on message passing GNNs (MPNNs), in this work we attend to the more powerful *higher-order* GNNs. First, we extend the $k$-WL test for graphons (Böker, 2023) to the graphon-signal space and introduce *signal-weighted homomorphism densities* as a key tool. As an exemplary focus, we generalize *Invariant Graph Networks* (IGNs) to graphons, proposing *Invariant Graphon Networks* (IWNs) defined via a subset of the IGN basis corresponding to bounded linear operators. Even with this restricted basis, we show that IWNs of order $k$ are at least as powerful as the $k$-WL test, and we establish universal approximation results for graphon-signals in $L^p$ distances. This significantly extends the prior work of Cai & Wang (2022), showing that IWNs—a subset of their *IGN-small*—retain effectively the same expressivity as the full IGN basis in the limit. In contrast to their approach, our blueprint of IWNs also aligns better with the geometry of graphon space, for example facilitating comparability to MPNNs. We highlight that, while typical higher-order GNNs are discontinuous w.r.t.\\ cut distance—which causes their lack of convergence and is inherently tied to the definition of $k$-WL—their transferability remains comparable to MPNNs",

Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, \\emph{i.e.}, feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance",

    "title": "Decomposition Polyhedra of Piecewise Linear Functions",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In this paper we contribute to the frequently studied question of how to decompose a continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) function into a difference of two convex CPWL functions. Every CPWL function has infinitely many such decompositions, but for applications in optimization and neural network theory, it is crucial to find decompositions with as few linear pieces as possible. This is a highly challenging problem, as we further demonstrate by disproving a recently proposed approach by Tran and Wang [Minimal representations of tropical rational functions. Algebraic Statistics, 15(1):27–59, 2024]. To make the problem more tractable, we propose to fix an underlying polyhedral complex determining the possible locus of nonlinearity. Under this assumption, we prove that the set of decompositions forms a polyhedron that arises as intersection of two translated cones. We prove that irreducible decompositions correspond to the bounded faces of this polyhedron and minimal solutions must be vertices. We then identify cases with a unique minimal decomposition, and illustrate how our insights have consequences in the theory of submodular functions. Finally, we improve upon previous constructions of neural networks for a given convex CPWL function and apply our framework to obtain results in the nonconvex case",

    "title": "Provably Accurate Shapley Value Estimation via Leverage Score Sampling",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Originally introduced in game theory, Shapley values have emerged as a central tool in explainable machine learning, where they are used to attribute model predictions to specific input features. However, computing Shapley values exactly is expensive: for a model with $n$ features, $O(2^n)$ model evaluations are necessary. To address this issue, approximation algorithms are widely used. One of the most popular is the Kernel SHAP algorithm, which is model agnostic and remarkably effective in practice. However, to the best of our knowledge, Kernel SHAP has no strong non-asymptotic complexity guarantees. We address this issue by introducing *Leverage SHAP*, a light-weight modification of Kernel SHAP that provides provably accurate Shapley value estimates with just $O(n\\log n)$ model evaluations. Our approach takes advantage of a connection between Shapley value estimation and agnostic active learning by employing *leverage score sampling*, a powerful regression tool. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we show that Leverage SHAP consistently outperforms even the highly optimized implementation of Kernel SHAP available in the ubiquitous SHAP library [Lundberg \\& Lee, 2017]",

    "abstract": "Reward Models (RMs) are crucial for aligning language models with human preferences. Currently, the evaluation of RMs depends on measuring accuracy against a validation set of manually annotated preference data. Although this method is straightforward and widely adopted, the relationship between RM accuracy and downstream policy performance remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct experiments in a synthetic setting to investigate how differences in RM measured by accuracy translate into gaps in optimized policy performance. Our findings reveal that while there is a weak positive correlation between accuracy and downstream performance, policies optimized towards RMs with similar accuracy can exhibit quite different performance. Moreover, we discover that the way of measuring accuracy significantly impacts its ability to predict the final policy performance. Through the lens of the Regressional Goodhart effect, we recognize that accuracy, when used for measuring RM quality, can fail to fully capture the potential RM overoptimization. This underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on accuracy to reflect their impact on policy optimization",

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.

Our bounds are shown to reflect the \"structure\" and \"simplicity'' of the encoder and significantly improve upon the few existing ones for the studied model. We then use our in-expectation bound to devise a suitable data-dependent regularizer; and we investigate thoroughly the important question of the selection of the prior. We propose a systematic approach to simultaneously learning a data-dependent Gaussian mixture prior and using it as a regularizer.

    "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline porous materials that have been widely utilized in petrochemical industries as well as sustainable chemistry areas. Synthesis of zeolites often requires small molecules termed Organic Structure Directing Agents (OSDAs), which are critical in forming the porous structure. Molecule generation models can aid the design of OSDAs, but they are limited by single functionality and lack of interactivity. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, as general-purpose artificial intelligence systems, excel in instruction comprehension, logical reasoning, and interactive communication. However, LLMs lack in-depth chemistry knowledge and first-principle computation capabilities, resulting in uncontrollable outcomes even after fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose OSDA Agent, an interactive OSDA design framework that leverages LLMs as the brain, coupled with computational chemistry tools. The OSDA Agent consists of three main components: the Actor, responsible for generating potential OSDA structures; the Evaluator, which assesses and scores the generated OSDAs using computational chemistry tools; and the Self-reflector, which produces reflective summaries based on the Evaluator's feedback to refine the Actor's subsequent outputs. Experiments on representative zeolite frameworks show the generation-evaluation-reflection-refinement workflow can perform de novo design of OSDAs with superior generation quality than the pure LLM model, generating candidates consistent with experimentally validated OSDAs and optimizing known OSDAs",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models are designed to incorporate external knowledge, reducing hallucinations caused by insufficient parametric (internal) knowledge. However, even with accurate and relevant retrieved content, RAG models can still produce hallucinations by generating outputs that conflict with the retrieved information. Detecting such hallucinations requires disentangling how Large Language Models (LLMs) balance external and parametric knowledge. Current detection methods often focus on one of these mechanisms or without decoupling their intertwined effects, making accurate detection difficult. In this paper, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind hallucinations in RAG scenarios. We discover hallucinations occur when the **Knowledge FFNs** in LLMs overemphasize parametric knowledge in the residual stream, while **Copying Heads** fail to effectively retain or integrate external knowledge from retrieved content. Based on these findings, we propose **ReDeEP**, a novel method that detects hallucinations by decoupling LLM's utilization of external context and parametric knowledge. Our experiments show that ReDeEP significantly improves RAG hallucination detection accuracy. Additionally, we introduce AARF, which mitigates hallucinations by modulating the contributions of Knowledge FFNs and Copying Heads",

While self-supervised learning in other domains aims to find patterns in a fixed dataset, self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) agents discover *new* behaviors by learning from the goals achieved during unstructured interaction with the environment. However, these methods have failed to see similar success, both due to a lack of data from slow environment simulations as well as a lack of stable algorithms. We take a step toward addressing both of these issues by releasing a high-performance codebase and benchmark (`JaxGCRL`) for self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to train agents for millions of environment steps in minutes on a single GPU. By utilizing GPU-accelerated replay buffers, environments, and a stable contrastive RL algorithm, we reduce training time by up to $22\\times$. Additionally, we assess key design choices in contrastive RL, identifying those that most effectively stabilize and enhance training performance. With this approach, we provide a foundation for future research in self-supervised GCRL, enabling researchers to quickly iterate on new ideas and evaluate them in diverse and challenging environments.

In this paper, we study the training dynamics of transformers over a CoT objective on a in-context weight prediction task for linear regression. We prove that while a one-layer linear transformer without CoT can only implement a single step of gradient descent (GD) and fails to recover the ground-truth weight vector, a transformer with CoT prompting can learn to perform multi-step GD autoregressively, achieving near-exact recovery. Furthermore, we show that the trained transformer effectively generalizes on the unseen data. Empirically, we demonstrate that CoT prompting yields substantial performance improvements",

These large networks avoid overfitting by integrating components that induce a simplicity bias, guiding models toward simple and generalizable solutions. However, in deep RL, designing and scaling up networks have been less explored. Motivated by this opportunity, we present SimBa, an architecture designed to scale up parameters in deep RL by injecting a simplicity bias. SimBa consists of three components: (i) an observation normalization layer that standardizes inputs with running statistics, (ii) a residual feedforward block to provide a linear pathway from the input to output, and (iii) a layer normalization to control feature magnitudes. By scaling up parameters with SimBa, the sample efficiency of various deep RL algorithms—including off-policy, on-policy, and unsupervised methods—is consistently improved. Moreover, solely by integrating SimBa architecture into SAC, it matches or surpasses state-of-the-art deep RL methods with high computational efficiency across DMC, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench. These results demonstrate SimBa's broad applicability and effectiveness across diverse RL algorithms and environments",

By analyzing the transfer functions of LTI systems, we find that SSMs exhibit an implicit bias toward capturing low-frequency components more effectively than high-frequency ones. This behavior aligns with the broader notion of frequency bias in deep learning model training. We show that the initialization of an SSM assigns it an innate frequency bias and that training the model in a conventional way does not alter this bias. Based on our theory, we propose two mechanisms to tune frequency bias: either by scaling the initialization to tune the inborn frequency bias; or by applying a Sobolev-norm-based filter to adjust the sensitivity of the gradients to high-frequency inputs, which allows us to change the frequency bias via training. Using an image-denoising task, we empirically show that we can strengthen, weaken, or even reverse the frequency bias using both mechanisms. By tuning the frequency bias, we can also improve SSMs' performance on learning long-range sequences, averaging an $88.26\\\\%$ accuracy on the Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark tasks",

We hypothesize that a core missing component is a lack of diverse LLM outputs, leading to inefficient search due to models repeatedly sampling highly similar, yet incorrect generations. We empirically demonstrate that this lack of diversity can be mitigated by searching over candidate plans for solving a problem in natural language. Based on this insight, we propose PlanSearch, a novel search algorithm which shows strong results across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and LiveCodeBench (a contamination-free benchmark for competitive coding). PlanSearch generates a diverse set of observations about the problem and uses these observations to construct plans for solving the problem. By searching over plans in natural language rather than directly over code solutions, PlanSearch explores a significantly more diverse range of potential solutions compared to baseline search methods. Using PlanSearch on top of Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieves a pass@200 of 77.0% on LiveCodeBench, outperforming both the best pass-rate achieved without any search (pass@1 = 41.4%) and using standard repeated sampling on top of existing non-search models (pass@200 = 60.6%).

However, the issue of automatically constructing high-quality training data to enhance the complex instruction-following abilities of LLMs without manual annotation remains unresolved. In this paper, we introduce AutoIF, the first scalable and reliable method for automatically generating instruction-following training data. AutoIF transforms the validation of instruction-following data quality into code verification, requiring LLMs to generate instructions, the corresponding code to verify the correctness of the instruction responses, and unit test samples to cross-validate the code's correctness. Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training. AutoIF achieves significant improvements across three training algorithms, SFT, Offline DPO, and Online DPO, when applied to the advanced open-source LLMs, Qwen2 and LLaMA3, in self-alignment and strong-to-weak distillation settings. Using two widely-used and three challenging general instruction-following benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoIF significantly improves LLM performance across a wide range of natural instruction constraints. Notably, AutoIF is the first to surpass 90\\% accuracy in IFEval's loose instruction accuracy, without compromising general, math and coding capabilities.

For easy and super-easy target functions, which are in the Hilbert space (RKHS) of the initial infinite-width neural tangent kernel (NTK), there is no change in the scaling exponents between feature learning models and models in the kernel regime. For hard tasks, which we define as tasks outside of the RKHS of the initial NTK, we show analytically and empirically that feature learning can improve the scaling with training time and compute, approximately doubling the exponent for very hard tasks. This leads to a new compute optimal scaling law for hard tasks in the feature learning regime.

Meanwhile, real-world datasets often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically, our framework consists of three key modules—dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization—that together harness extensive pre-trained multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize the selection results through multi-objective optimization.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Preferential Bayesian Optimization (PBO) is a sample-efficient method to learn latent user utilities from preferential feedback over a pair of designs. It relies on a statistical surrogate model for the latent function, usually a Gaussian process, and an acquisition strategy to select the next candidate pair to get user feedback on. Due to the non-conjugacy of the associated likelihood, every PBO step requires a significant amount of computations with various approximate inference techniques. This computational overhead is incompatible with the way humans interact with computers, hindering the use of PBO in real-world cases. Building on the recent advances of amortized BO, we propose to circumvent this issue by fully amortizing PBO, meta-learning both the surrogate and the acquisition function. Our method comprises a novel transformer neural process architecture, trained using reinforcement learning and tailored auxiliary losses. On a benchmark composed of synthetic and real-world datasets, our method is several orders of magnitude faster than the usual Gaussian process-based strategies and often outperforms them in accuracy",

Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively.

This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model that builds upon the RWKV architecture from the NLP field with key modifications tailored specifically for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model demonstrates robust global processing capabilities, efficiently handles sparse inputs like masked images, and can scale up to accommodate both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage is its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, enabling seamless processing of high-resolution images without the need for window operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Despite graph neural networks' (GNNs) great success in modelling graph-structured data, out-of-distribution (OOD) test instances still pose a great challenge for current GNNs. One of the most effective techniques to detect OOD nodes is to expose the detector model with an additional OOD node-set, yet the extra OOD instances are often difficult to obtain in practice. Recent methods for image data address this problem using OOD data synthesis, typically relying on pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion. However, these approaches require vast amounts of additional data, as well as one-for-all pre-trained generative models, which are not available for graph data. Therefore, we propose the GOLD framework for graph OOD detection, an implicit adversarial learning pipeline with synthetic OOD exposure without pre-trained models. The implicit adversarial training process employs a novel alternating optimisation framework by training: (1) a latent generative model to regularly imitate the in-distribution (ID) embeddings from an evolving GNN, and (2) a GNN encoder and an OOD detector to accurately classify ID data while increasing the energy divergence between the ID embeddings and the generative model's synthetic embeddings. This novel approach implicitly transforms the synthetic embeddings into pseudo-OOD instances relative to the ID data, effectively simulating exposure to OOD scenarios without auxiliary data. Extensive OOD detection experiments are conducted on five benchmark graph datasets, verifying the superior performance of GOLD without using real OOD data compared with the state-of-the-art OOD exposure and non-exposure baselines",

However, LoRA tuning not only injects knowledgeable features but also noisy hallucination during fine-tuning, which hinders the utilization of tunable parameters with the increasing LoRA rank. In this work, we first investigate in-depth the redundancies among LoRA parameters with substantial empirical studies. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of high ranks from the findings, we set up a new fine-tuning framework, \\textbf{P}arameter-\\textbf{Re}dundant \\textbf{F}ine-\\textbf{T}uning (\\preft), which follows the vanilla LoRA tuning process but is required to reduce redundancies before merging LoRA parameters back to pre-trained models.

    "abstract": "Understanding neural representations will help open the black box of neural networks and advance our scientific understanding of modern AI systems. However, how complex, structured, and transferable representations emerge in modern neural networks has remained a mystery. Building on previous results, we propose the Canonical Representation Hypothesis (CRH), which posits a set of six alignment relations to universally govern the formation of representations in most hidden layers of a neural network. Under the CRH, the latent representations (R), weights (W), and neuron gradients (G) become mutually aligned during training. This alignment implies that neural networks naturally learn compact representations, where neurons and weights are invariant to task-irrelevant transformations. We then show that the breaking of CRH leads to the emergence of reciprocal power-law relations between R, W, and G, which we refer to as the Polynomial Alignment Hypothesis (PAH). We present a minimal-assumption theory proving that the balance between gradient noise and regularization is crucial for the emergence of the canonical representation. The CRH and PAH lead to an exciting possibility of unifying major key deep learning phenomena, including neural collapse and the neural feature ansatz, in a single framework",

    "abstract": "Handling implicit language is essential for natural language processing systems to achieve precise text understanding and facilitate natural interactions with users. Despite its importance, the absence of a metric for accurately measuring the implicitness of language significantly constrains the depth of analysis possible in evaluating models' comprehension capabilities. This paper addresses this gap by developing a scalar metric that quantifies the implicitness level of language without relying on external references. Drawing on principles from traditional linguistics, we define \"implicitness\" as the divergence between semantic meaning and pragmatic interpretation. To operationalize this definition, we introduce ImpScore, a reference-free metric formulated through an interpretable regression model. This model is trained using pairwise contrastive learning on a specially curated dataset consisting of (*implicit sentence*, *explicit sentence*) pairs. We validate ImpScore through a user study that compares its assessments with human evaluations on out-of-distribution data, demonstrating its accuracy and strong correlation with human judgments. Additionally, we apply ImpScore to hate speech detection datasets, illustrating its utility and highlighting significant limitations in current large language models' ability to understand highly implicit content.

    "abstract": "Understanding and explaining differences between audio recordings is crucial for fields like audio forensics, quality assessment, and audio generation. This involves identifying and describing audio events, acoustic scenes, signal characteristics, and their emotional impact on listeners. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively study the task of explaining audio differences and then propose benchmark, baselines for the task. First, we present two new datasets for audio difference explanation derived from the AudioCaps and Clotho audio captioning datasets. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we generate three levels of difference explanations: (1) concise descriptions of audio events and objects, (2) brief sentences about audio events, acoustic scenes, and signal properties, and (3) comprehensive explanations that include semantics and listener emotions. For the baseline, we use prefix tuning where audio embeddings from two audio files are used to prompt a frozen language model. Our empirical analysis and ablation studies reveal that the naive baseline struggles to distinguish perceptually similar sounds and generate detailed tier 3 explanations. To address these limitations, we propose ADIFF, which introduces a cross-projection module, position captioning, and a three-step training process to enhance the model's ability to produce detailed explanations. We evaluate our model using objective metrics and human evaluation and show our model enhancements lead to significant improvements in performance over naive baseline and SoTA Audio-Language Model (ALM) Qwen Audio. Lastly, we conduct multiple ablation studies to study the effects of cross-projection, language model parameters, position captioning, third stage fine-tuning, and present our findings.

However, they often produce inconsistent results for compositional prompts such as \"two dogs\" or \"a penguin on the right of a bowl\". Understanding these inconsistencies is crucial for reliable image generation. In this paper, we highlight the significant role of initial noise in these inconsistencies, where certain noise patterns are more reliable for compositional prompts than others. Our analyses reveal that different initial random seeds tend to guide the model to place objects in distinct image areas, potentially adhering to specific patterns of camera angles and image composition associated with the seed. To improve the model's compositional ability, we propose a method for mining these reliable cases, resulting in a curated training set of generated images without requiring any manual annotation. By fine-tuning text-to-image models on these generated images, we significantly enhance their compositional capabilities. For numerical composition, we observe relative increases of 29.3\\% and 19.5\\% for Stable Diffusion and PixArt-$\\alpha$, respectively.

    "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation, also known as LoRA, has emerged as a prominent method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation models. Despite its computational efficiency, LoRA still yields inferior performance compared to full fine-tuning. In this paper, we first uncover a fundamental connection between the optimization processes of LoRA and full fine-tuning: using LoRA for optimization is mathematically equivalent to full fine-tuning using a low-rank gradient for parameter updates. And this low-rank gradient can be expressed in terms of the gradients of the two low-rank matrices in LoRA. Leveraging this insight, we introduce LoRA-Pro, a method that enhances LoRA's performance by strategically adjusting the gradients of these low-rank matrices. This adjustment allows the low-rank gradient to more accurately approximate the full fine-tuning gradient, thereby narrowing the performance gap between LoRA and full fine-tuning. Furthermore, we theoretically derive the optimal solutions for adjusting the gradients of the low-rank matrices, applying them during fine-tuning in LoRA-Pro. We conduct extensive experiments across natural language understanding, dialogue generation, mathematical reasoning, code generation, and image classification tasks, demonstrating that LoRA-Pro substantially improves LoRA's performance, effectively narrowing the gap with full fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities, leading to ambiguous patient-level pairings. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease (including several most deadly cancers) diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent research pinpoints that different diffusion methods and architectures trained on the same dataset produce similar results for the same input noise. This property suggests that they have some preferable noises for a given sample. By visualizing the noise-sample pairs of rectified flow models and stable diffusion models in two-dimensional spaces, we observe that the preferable paths, connecting preferable noises to the corresponding samples, are better organized with significant fewer crossings comparing with the random paths, connecting random noises to training samples. In high-dimensional space, paths rarely intersect. The path crossings in two-dimensional spaces indicate the shorter inter-path distance in the corresponding high-dimensional spaces. Inspired by this observation, we propose the Distance-Aware Noise-Sample Matching (DANSM) method to lengthen the inter-path distance for speeding up the model training. DANSM is derived from rectified flow models, which allow using a closed-form formula to calculate the inter-path distance. To further simplify the optimization, we derive the relationship between inter-path distance and path length, and use the latter in the optimization surrogate. DANSM is evaluated on both image and latent spaces by rectified flow models and diffusion models.

Variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are the predominant tools for this task; however, both are often challenging to apply reliably, particularly when the posterior has complex geometry. Here, we introduce Soft Contrastive Variational Inference (SoftCVI), which allows a family of variational objectives to be derived through a contrastive estimation framework. The approach parameterizes a classifier in terms of a variational distribution, reframing the inference task as a contrastive estimation problem aiming to identify a single true posterior sample among a set of samples. Despite this framing, we do not require positive or negative samples, but rather learn by sampling the variational distribution and computing ground truth soft classification labels from the unnormalized posterior itself. The objectives have zero variance gradient when the variational approximation is exact, without the need for specialized gradient estimators. We empirically investigate the performance on a variety of Bayesian inference tasks, using both simple (e.g. normal) and expressive (normalizing flow) variational distributions. We find that SoftCVI can be used to form objectives which are stable to train and mass-covering, frequently outperforming inference with other variational approaches",

    "abstract": "Estimating geometry from dynamic scenes, where objects move and deform over time, remains a core challenge in computer vision. Current approaches often rely on multi-stage pipelines or global optimizations that decompose the problem into subtasks, like depth and flow, leading to complex systems prone to errors. In this paper, we present Motion DUSt3R (MonST3R), a novel geometry-first approach that directly estimates per-timestep geometry from dynamic scenes. Our key insight is that by simply estimating a pointmap for each timestep, we can effectively adapt DUSt3R's representation, previously only used for static scenes, to dynamic scenes. However, this approach presents a significant challenge: the scarcity of suitable training data, namely dynamic, posed videos with depth labels. Despite this, we show that by posing the problem as a fine-tuning task, identifying several suitable datasets, and strategically training the model on this limited data, we can surprisingly enable the model to handle dynamics, even without an explicit motion representation. Based on this, we introduce new optimizations for several downstream video-specific tasks and demonstrate strong performance on video depth and camera pose estimation, outperforming prior work in terms of robustness and efficiency.

    "title": "ND-SDF: Learning Normal Deflection Fields for High-Fidelity Indoor Reconstruction",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Neural implicit reconstruction via volume rendering has demonstrated its effectiveness in recovering dense 3D surfaces. However, it is non-trivial to simultaneously recover meticulous geometry and preserve smoothness across regions with differing characteristics. To address this issue, previous methods typically employ geometric priors, which are often constrained by the performance of the prior models. In this paper, we propose ND-SDF, which learns a Normal Deflection field to represent the angular deviation between the scene normal and the prior normal. Unlike previous methods that uniformly apply geometric priors on all samples, introducing significant bias in accuracy, our proposed normal deflection field dynamically learns and adapts the utilization of samples based on their specific characteristics, thereby improving both the accuracy and effectiveness of the model. Our method not only obtains smooth weakly textured regions such as walls and floors but also preserves the geometric details of complex structures. In addition, we introduce a novel ray sampling strategy based on the deflection angle to facilitate the unbiased rendering process, which significantly improves the quality and accuracy of intricate surfaces, especially on thin structures. Consistent improvements on various challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method",

    "title": "SlowFast-VGen: Slow-Fast Learning for Action-Driven Long Video Generation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Human beings are endowed with a complementary learning system, which bridges the slow learning of general world dynamics with fast storage of episodic memory from a new experience. Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89. The slow-fast learning loop algorithm significantly enhances performances on long-horizon planning tasks as well",

    "title": "Atlas Gaussians Diffusion for 3D Generation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Using the latent diffusion model has proven effective in developing novel 3D generation techniques. To harness the latent diffusion model, a key challenge is designing a high-fidelity and efficient representation that links the latent space and the 3D space. In this paper, we introduce Atlas Gaussians, a novel representation for feed-forward native 3D generation. Atlas Gaussians represent a shape as the union of local patches, and each patch can decode 3D Gaussians. We parameterize a patch as a sequence of feature vectors and design a learnable function to decode 3D Gaussians from the feature vectors. In this process, we incorporate UV-based sampling, enabling the generation of a sufficiently large, and theoretically infinite, number of 3D Gaussian points. The large amount of 3D Gaussians enables the generation of high-quality details. Moreover, due to local awareness of the representation, the transformer-based decoding procedure operates on a patch level, ensuring efficiency. We train a variational autoencoder to learn the Atlas Gaussians representation, and then apply a latent diffusion model on its latent space for learning 3D Generation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the prior arts of feed-forward native 3D generation. Project page: https://yanghtr.github.io/projects/atlas_gaussians",

    "abstract": "The problem of pre-training data detection for large language models (LLMs) has received growing attention due to its implications in critical issues like copyright violation and test data contamination. Despite improved performance, existing methods (including the state-of-the-art, Min-K%) are mostly developed upon simple heuristics and lack solid, reasonable foundations. In this work, we propose a novel and theoretically motivated methodology for pre-training data detection, named Min-K%++. Specifically, we present a key insight that training samples tend to be local maxima of the modeled distribution along each input dimension through maximum likelihood training, which in turn allow us to insightfully translate the problem into identification of local maxima. Then, we design our method accordingly that works under the discrete distribution modeled by LLMs, whose core idea is to determine whether the input forms a mode or has relatively high probability under the conditional categorical distribution. Empirically, the proposed method achieves new SOTA performance across multiple settings (evaluated with 5 families of 10 models and 2 benchmarks). On the WikiMIA benchmark, Min-K%++ outperforms the runner-up by 6.2% to 10.5% in detection AUROC averaged over five models. On the more challenging MIMIR benchmark, it consistently improves upon reference-free methods while performing on par with reference-based method that requires an extra reference model",

    "abstract": "The blooming of virtual reality and augmented reality (VR/AR) technologies has driven an increasing demand for the creation of high-quality, immersive, and dynamic environments. However, existing generative techniques either focus solely on dynamic objects or perform outpainting from a single perspective image, failing to meet the requirements of VR/AR applications that need free-viewpoint, 360$^{\\circ}$ virtual views where users can move in all directions. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of elevating a single panorama to an immersive 4D experience. For the first time, we demonstrate the capability to generate omnidirectional dynamic scenes with 360$^{\\circ}$ views at 4K (4096 $\\times$ 2048) resolution, thereby providing an immersive user experience. Our method introduces a pipeline that facilitates natural scene animations and optimizes a set of 3D Gaussians using efficient splatting techniques for real-time exploration. To overcome the lack of scene-scale annotated 4D data and models, especially in panoramic formats, we propose a novel Panoramic Denoiser that adapts generic 2D diffusion priors to animate consistently in 360$^{\\circ}$ images, transforming them into panoramic videos with dynamic scenes at targeted regions. Subsequently, we propose Dynamic Panoramic Lifting to elevate the panoramic video into a 4D immersive environment while preserving spatial and temporal consistency. By transferring prior knowledge from 2D models in the perspective domain to the panoramic domain and the 4D lifting with spatial appearance and geometry regularization, we achieve high-quality Panorama-to-4D generation at a resolution of 4K for the first time.

    "abstract": "Multiple object tracking in complex scenarios - such as coordinated dance performances, team sports, or dynamic animal groups - presents unique challenges. In these settings, objects frequently move in coordinated patterns, occlude each other, and exhibit long-term dependencies in their trajectories. However, it remains a key open research question on how to model long-range dependencies within tracklets, interdependencies among tracklets, and the associated temporal occlusions. To this end, we introduce Samba, a novel linear-time set-of-sequences model designed to jointly process multiple tracklets by synchronizing the multiple selective state-spaces used to model each tracklet. Samba autoregressively predicts the future track query for each sequence while maintaining synchronized long-term memory representations across tracklets. By integrating Samba into a tracking-by-propagation framework, we propose SambaMOTR, the first tracker effectively addressing the aforementioned issues, including long-range dependencies, tracklet interdependencies, and temporal occlusions. Additionally, we introduce an effective technique for dealing with uncertain observations (MaskObs) and an efficient training recipe to scale SambaMOTR to longer sequences. By modeling long-range dependencies and interactions among tracked objects, SambaMOTR implicitly learns to track objects accurately through occlusions without any hand-crafted heuristics. Our approach significantly surpasses prior state-of-the-art on the DanceTrack, BFT, and SportsMOT datasets",

Existing activation steering methods alter LLM behavior indiscriminately, limiting their practical applicability in settings where selective responses are essential, such as content moderation or domain-specific assistants.

Our method is based on the observation that different categories of prompts activate distinct patterns in the model's hidden states. Using CAST, one can systematically control LLM behavior with rules like \"if input is about hate speech or adult content, then refuse\" or \"if input is not about legal advice, then refuse.\" This allows for selective modification of responses to specific content while maintaining normal responses to other content, all without requiring weight optimization.

    "abstract": "The ability to accurately interpret complex visual information is a crucial topic of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent work indicates that enhanced visual perception significantly reduces hallucinations and improves performance on resolution-sensitive tasks, such as optical character recognition and document analysis. A number of recent MLLMs achieve this goal using a mixture of vision encoders. Despite their success, there is a lack of systematic comparisons and detailed ablation studies addressing critical aspects, such as expert selection and the integration of multiple vision experts. This study provides an extensive exploration of the design space for MLLMs using a mixture of vision encoders and resolutions. Our findings reveal several underlying principles common to various existing strategies, leading to a streamlined yet effective design approach. We discover that simply concatenating visual tokens from a set of complementary vision encoders is as effective as more complex mixing architectures or strategies. We additionally introduce Pre-Alignment to bridge the gap between vision-focused encoders and language tokens, enhancing model coherence.

Our key insight is that motion diffusion can serve as an on-the-fly universal planner for a robust RL controller. To this end, CLoSD maintains a closed-loop interaction between two modules — a Diffusion Planner (DiP), and a tracking controller. DiP is a fast-responding autoregressive diffusion model, controlled by textual prompts and target locations, and the controller is a simple and robust motion imitator that continuously receives motion plans from DiP and provides feedback from the environment.

If the third condition is relaxed, the SCM becomes finitely identifiable; more specifically, it belongs to a set of at most $n!$ linear SCMS, where $n$ is the number of observed variables. The confounders in all of these $n!$ SCMs share the same joint probability distribution function (PDF), which we obtain analytically. For the case where both the noise and confounders are Gaussian, we provide further insight into the existing counter-example-based unidentifiability result and demonstrate that every SCM with confounders can be represented as an SCM without confounders but with the same joint PDF",

Motivated by this example, we define a neural network's **average geometry** and **average geometry evolution** as compact *architecture-dependent* summaries of the model's input-output geometry and its evolution during training. By investigating the average geometry evolution at initialization, we discover that the geometry of a neural network evolves according to the data covariance projected onto its average geometry. This means that the geometry only changes in a subset of the input space when the average geometry is low-rank, such as in ResNets. This causes an architecture-dependent invariance property in the input space curvature, which we dub GIH.

It leverages clustering in the action space and learns two different policies via policy- and regression-based approaches, respectively. In particular, we derive a novel low-variance gradient estimator that enables to learn a first-stage policy for cluster selection efficiently via a policy-based approach. To select a specific action within the cluster sampled by the first-stage policy, POTEC uses a second-stage policy derived from a regression-based approach within each cluster. We show that a local correctness condition, which only requires that the regression model preserves the relative expected reward differences of the actions within each cluster, ensures that our policy-gradient estimator is unbiased and the second-stage policy is optimal. We also show that POTEC provides a strict generalization of policy- and regression-based approaches and their associated assumptions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POTEC provides substantial improvements in OPL effectiveness particularly in large and structured action spaces",

FDR transforms the regression process from predicting fixed coordinates to iteratively refining probability distributions, providing a fine-grained intermediate representation that significantly enhances localization accuracy.

    "abstract": "Text-conditioned human motion generation, which allows for user interaction through natural language, has become increasingly popular. Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose **DartC**ontrol, in short **DART**, a **D**iffusion-based **A**utoregressive motion primitive model for **R**eal-time **T**ext-driven motion **C**ontrol. Our model, DART, effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally, the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model's versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks.

Unlike existing methods, it enables gradient-based, end-to-end learning of interpretable, axis-aligned decision trees within standard on-policy RL algorithms.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has substantially improved the generalization of neural networks under various settings. Despite the success, its effectiveness remains poorly understood. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon in the training dynamics of SAM, shedding light on understanding its implicit bias towards flatter minima over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). Specifically, we find that *SAM efficiently selects flatter minima late in training*. Remarkably, even a few epochs of SAM applied at the end of training yield nearly the same generalization and solution sharpness as full SAM training. Subsequently, we delve deeper into the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. Theoretically, we identify two phases in the learning dynamics after applying SAM late in training: i) SAM first escapes the minimum found by SGD exponentially fast; and ii) then rapidly converges to a flatter minimum within the same valley. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the role of SAM during the early training phase. We conjecture that the optimization method chosen in the late phase is more crucial in shaping the final solution's properties. Based on this viewpoint, we extend our findings from SAM to Adversarial Training",

    "title": "What Makes a Good Diffusion Planner for Decision Making?",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently shown significant potential in solving decision-making problems, particularly in generating behavior plans -- also known as diffusion planning. While numerous studies have demonstrated the impressive performance of diffusion planning, the mechanisms behind the key components of a good diffusion planner remain unclear and the design choices are highly inconsistent in existing studies. In this work, we address this issue through systematic empirical experiments on diffusion planning in an offline reinforcement learning (RL) setting, providing practical insights into the essential components of diffusion planning. We trained and evaluated over 6,000 diffusion models, identifying the critical components such as guided sampling, network architecture, action generation and planning strategy. We revealed that some design choices opposite to the common practice in previous work in diffusion planning actually lead to better performance, e.g., unconditional sampling with selection can be better than guided sampling and Transformer outperforms U-Net as denoising network. Based on these insights, we suggest a simple yet strong diffusion planning baseline that achieves state-of-the-art results on standard offline RL benchmarks.

    "title": "ThinK: Thinner Key Cache by Query-Driven Pruning",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing, achieving unprecedented performance across a variety of applications. However, their increased computational and memory demands present significant challenges, especially when handling long sequences. This paper focuses on the long-context scenario, addressing the inefficiencies in KV cache memory consumption during inference. Unlike existing approaches that optimize the memory based on the sequence length, we identify substantial redundancy in the channel dimension of the KV cache, as indicated by an uneven magnitude distribution and a low-rank structure in the attention weights. In response, we propose ThinK, a novel query-dependent KV cache pruning method designed to minimize attention weight loss while selectively pruning the least significant channels. Our approach not only maintains or enhances model accuracy but also achieves a reduction in KV cache memory costs by over 20\\% compared with vanilla KV cache eviction and quantization methods. For instance, ThinK integrated with KIVI can achieve $2.8\\times$ peak memory reduction while maintaining nearly the same quality, enabling a batch size increase from 4$\\times$ (with KIVI alone) to 5$\\times$ when using a single GPU. Extensive evaluations on the LLaMA and Mistral models across various long-sequence datasets verified the efficiency of ThinK.

    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Efficient comparison of spherical probability distributions becomes important in fields such as computer vision, geosciences, and medicine. Sliced optimal transport distances, such as spherical and stereographic spherical sliced Wasserstein distances, have recently been developed to address this need. These methods reduce the computational burden of optimal transport by slicing hyperspheres into one-dimensional projections, i.e., lines or circles. Concurrently, linear optimal transport has been proposed to embed distributions into $L^2$ spaces, where the $L^2$ distance approximates the optimal transport distance, thereby simplifying comparisons across multiple distributions. In this work, we introduce the Linear Spherical Sliced Optimal Transport (LSSOT) framework, which utilizes slicing to embed spherical distributions into $L^2$ spaces while preserving their intrinsic geometry, offering a computationally efficient metric for spherical probability measures. We establish the metricity of LSSOT and demonstrate its superior computational efficiency in applications such as cortical surface registration, 3D point cloud interpolation via gradient flow, and shape embedding. Our results demonstrate the significant computational benefits and high accuracy of LSSOT in these applications",

    "abstract": "We propose RelitLRM, a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) for generating high-quality Gaussian splatting representations of 3D objects under novel illuminations from sparse (4-8) posed images captured under unknown static lighting. Unlike prior inverse rendering methods requiring dense captures and slow optimization, often causing artifacts like incorrect highlights or shadow baking, RelitLRM adopts a feed-forward transformer-based model with a novel combination of a geometry reconstructor and a relightable appearance generator based on diffusion. The model is trained end-to-end on synthetic multi-view renderings of objects under varying known illuminations. This architecture design enables to effectively decompose geometry and appearance, resolve the ambiguity between material and lighting, and capture the multi-modal distribution of shadows and specularity in the relit appearance. We show our sparse-view feed-forward RelitLRM offers competitive relighting results to state-of-the-art dense-view optimization-based baselines while being significantly faster.

    "abstract": "As deep generative models have progressed, recent work has shown them to be capable of memorizing and reproducing training datapoints when deployed. These findings call into question the usability of generative models, especially in light of the legal and privacy risks brought about by memorization. To better understand this phenomenon, we propose the *manifold memorization hypothesis* (MMH), a geometric framework which leverages the manifold hypothesis into a clear language in which to reason about memorization. We propose to analyze memorization in terms of the relationship between the dimensionalities of $(i)$ the ground truth data manifold and $(ii)$ the manifold learned by the model. This framework provides a formal standard for \"how memorized\" a datapoint is and systematically categorizes memorized data into two types: memorization driven by overfitting and memorization driven by the underlying data distribution. By analyzing prior work in the context of the MMH, we explain and unify assorted observations in the literature. We empirically validate the MMH using synthetic data and image datasets up to the scale of Stable Diffusion, developing new tools for detecting and preventing generation of memorized samples in the process",

For Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics equations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly difficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed by PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by ensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific gradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms and dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We additionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the back-propagation of different loss terms. We provide a mathematical proof showing the convergence of the ConFIG method, and it is evaluated across a range of challenging PINN scenarios.

    "title": "DLEFT-MKC: Dynamic Late Fusion Multiple Kernel Clustering with Robust Tensor Learning via Min-Max Optimization",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in multiple kernel clustering (MKC) have highlighted the effectiveness of late fusion strategies, particularly in enhancing computational efficiency to near-linear complexity while achieving promising clustering performance. However, existing methods encounter three significant limitations: (1) reliance on fixed base partition matrices that do not adaptively optimize during the clustering process, thereby constraining their performance to the inherent representational capabilities of these matrices; (2) a focus on adjusting kernel weights to explore inter-view consistency and complementarity, which often neglects the intrinsic high-order correlations among views, thereby limiting the extraction of comprehensive multiple kernel information; (3) a lack of adaptive mechanisms to accommodate varying distributions within the data, which limits robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel algorithm termed Dynamic Late Fusion Multiple Kernel Clustering with Robust {Tensor Learning via min-max optimization (DLEFT-MKC), which effectively overcomes the representational bottleneck of base partition matrices and facilitates the learning of meaningful high-order cross-view information. Specifically, it is the first to incorporate a min-max optimization paradigm into tensor-based MKC, enhancing algorithm robustness and generalization. Additionally, it dynamically reconstructs decision layers to enhance representation capabilities and subsequently stacks the reconstructed representations for tensor learning that promotes the capture of high-order associations and cluster structures across views, ultimately yielding consensus clustering partitions. To solve the resultant optimization problem, we innovatively design a strategy that combines reduced gradient descent with the alternating direction method of multipliers, ensuring convergence to local optima while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experimental results across various benchmark datasets validate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed DLEFT-MKC",

Reliance on such correlations can cause these networks to malfunction when deployed in the real world, where these correlations may no longer hold. To overcome the learning of and reliance on such correlations, recent studies propose approaches that yield promising results. These works, however, study settings where the strength of the spurious signal is significantly greater than that of the core, invariant signal, making it easier to detect the presence of spurious features in individual training samples and allow for further processing. In this paper, we identify new settings where the strength of the spurious signal is relatively weaker, making it difficult to detect any spurious information while continuing to have catastrophic consequences. We also discover that spurious correlations are learned primarily due to only a handful of all the samples containing the spurious feature and develop a novel data pruning technique that identifies and prunes small subsets of the training data that contain these samples. Our proposed technique does not require inferred domain knowledge, information regarding the sample-wise presence or nature of spurious information, or human intervention. Finally, we show that such data pruning attains state-of-the-art performance on previously studied settings where spurious information is identifiable",

Previous works involving continued mathematical pretraining often include code that utilizes math-related packages, which are primarily designed for fields such as engineering, machine learning, signal processing, or module testing, rather than being directly focused on mathematical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for generating mathematical code accompanied with corresponding reasoning steps for continued pretraining. Our approach begins with the construction of a high-quality mathematical continued pretraining dataset by incorporating math-related web data, code using mathematical packages, math textbooks, and synthetic data. Next, we construct reasoning steps by extracting LaTeX expressions, the conditions needed for the expressions, and the results of the expressions from the previously collected dataset. Based on this extracted information, we generate corresponding code to accurately capture the mathematical reasoning process. Appending the generated code to each reasoning step results in data consisting of paired natural language reasoning steps and their corresponding code. Combining this data with the original dataset results in a 19.2B-token high-performing mathematical pretraining corpus, which we name MathCode-Pile. Training several popular base models with this corpus significantly improves their mathematical abilities, leading to the creation of the MathCoder2 family of models.

Among existing studies, certified graph unlearning is distinguished by providing robust privacy guarantees. However, current certified graph unlearning methods are impractical for large-scale graphs because they necessitate the costly re-computation of graph propagation for each unlearning request. Although numerous scalable techniques have been developed to accelerate graph propagation for GNNs, their integration into certified graph unlearning remains uncertain as these scalable approaches introduce approximation errors into node embeddings. In contrast, certified graph unlearning demands bounded model error on exact node embeddings to maintain its certified guarantee. To address this challenge, we present ScaleGUN, the first approach to scale certified graph unlearning to billion-edge graphs.

Given the pre-trained representations, only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e., representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

    "title": "TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Transformers have become the predominant architecture in foundation models due to their excellent performance across various domains. However, the substantial cost of scaling these models remains a significant concern. This problem arises primarily from their dependence on a fixed number of parameters within linear projections. When architectural modifications (e.g., channel dimensions) are introduced, the entire model typically requires retraining from scratch. As model sizes continue growing, this strategy results in increasingly high computational costs and becomes unsustainable. To overcome this problem, we introduce Tokenformer, a natively scalable architecture that leverages the attention mechanism not only for computations among input tokens but also for interactions between tokens and model parameters, thereby enhancing architectural flexibility. By treating model parameters as tokens, we replace all the linear projections in Transformers with our token-parameter attention layer, where input tokens act as queries and model parameters as keys and values. This reformulation allows for progressive and efficient scaling without necessitating retraining from scratch. Our model scales from 124M to 1.4B parameters by incrementally adding new key-value parameter pairs, achieving performance comparable to Transformers trained from scratch while greatly reducing training costs.

    "title": "Simple yet Effective Incomplete Multi-view Clustering: Similarity-level Imputation and Intra-view Hybrid-group Prototype Construction",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Most of incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) methods typically choose to ignore the missing samples and only utilize observed unpaired samples to construct bipartite similarity. Moreover, they employ a single quantity of prototypes to extract the information of $\\textbf{all}$ views. To eliminate these drawbacks, we present a simple yet effective IMVC approach, SIIHPC, in this work. It firstly transforms partial bipartition learning into original sample form by virtue of reconstruction concept to split out of observed similarity, and then loosens traditional non-negative constraints via regularizing samples to more freely characterize the similarity. Subsequently, it learns to recover the incomplete parts by utilizing the connection built between the similarity exclusive on respective view and the consensus graph shared for all views. On this foundation, it further introduces a group of hybrid prototype quantities for each individual view to flexibly extract the data features belonging to each view itself. Accordingly, the resulting graphs are with various scales and describe the overall similarity more comprehensively. It is worth mentioning that these all are optimized in one unified learning framework, which makes it possible for them to reciprocally promote. Then, to effectively solve the formulated optimization problem, we design an ingenious auxiliary function that is with theoretically proven monotonic-increasing properties. Finally, the clustering results are obtained by implementing spectral grouping action on the eigenvectors of stacked multi-scale consensus similarity. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of SIIHPC",

In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for LLMs designed to be resistant to both test set contamination and the pitfalls of LLM judging and human crowdsourcing. We release LiveBench, the first benchmark that (1) contains frequently-updated questions from recent information sources, (2) scores answers automatically according to objective ground-truth values, and (3) contains a wide variety of challenging tasks, spanning math, coding, reasoning, language, instruction following, and data analysis.

We evaluate many prominent closed-source models, as well as dozens of open-source models ranging from 0.5B to 405B in size. LiveBench is difficult, with top models achieving below 70% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved record-breaking performance in image generation tasks. Nevertheless, in practice, the training-sampling discrepancy, caused by score estimation error and discretization error, limits the modeling ability of DMs, a phenomenon known as exposure bias. To alleviate such exposure bias and further improve the generative performance, we put forward a prompt learning framework built upon a lightweight prompt prediction model. Concretely, our model learns an anti-bias prompt for the generated sample at each sampling step, aiming to compensate for the exposure bias that arises. Following this design philosophy, our framework rectifies the sampling trajectory to match the training trajectory, thereby reducing the divergence between the target data distribution and the modeling distribution. To train the prompt prediction model, we simulate exposure bias by constructing training data and introduce a time-dependent weighting function for optimization. Empirical results on various DMs demonstrate the superiority of our prompt learning framework across three benchmark datasets. Importantly, the optimized prompt prediction model effectively improves image quality with only a 5\\% increase in sampling overhead, which remains negligible",

However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D occupancy generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality dynamic 4D scenes with semantics. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. **1)** A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel **Projection Module** to effectively compress 4D features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to **12.56** mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an **Expansion & Squeeze Strategy** to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to **7.05** mIoU gain, **2.06x** training speedup, and **70.84\\%** memory reduction). **2)** A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a **Padded Rollout Operation** is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting **versatile 4D generation applications**, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation.

Among these algorithms, diffusion-based models (DM) have shown promising performance but are often burdened by heavy computational demands and pixel misalignment issues when predicting the image-level distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to leverage DM within a compact latent space to generate concise guidance priors and introduce a novel solution called Reti-Diff for the IDIR task. Specifically, Reti-Diff comprises two significant components: the Retinex-based latent DM (RLDM) and the Retinex-guided transformer (RGformer). RLDM is designed to acquire Retinex knowledge, extracting reflectance and illumination priors to facilitate detailed reconstruction and illumination correction. RGformer subsequently utilizes these compact priors to guide the decomposition of image features into their respective reflectance and illumination components. Following this, RGformer further enhances and consolidates these decomposed features, resulting in the production of refined images with consistent content and robustness to handle complex degradation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Reti-Diff outperforms existing methods on three IDIR tasks, as well as downstream applications",

    "abstract": "In applications of diffusion models, controllable generation is of practical significance, but is also challenging. Current methods for controllable generation primarily focus on modifying the score function of diffusion models, while Mean Reverting (MR) Diffusion directly modifies the structure of the stochastic differential equation (SDE), making the incorporation of image conditions simpler and more natural. However, current training-free fast samplers are not directly applicable to MR Diffusion. And thus MR Diffusion requires hundreds of NFEs (number of function evaluations) to obtain high-quality samples. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm named MaRS (MR Sampler) to reduce the sampling NFEs of MR Diffusion. We solve the reverse-time SDE and the probability flow ordinary differential equation (PF-ODE) associated with MR Diffusion, and derive semi-analytical solutions. The solutions consist of an analytical function and an integral parameterized by a neural network. Based on this solution, we can generate high-quality samples in fewer steps. Our approach does not require training and supports all mainstream parameterizations, including noise prediction, data prediction and velocity prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR Sampler maintains high sampling quality with a speedup of 10 to 20 times across ten different image restoration tasks. Our algorithm accelerates the sampling procedure of MR Diffusion, making it more practical in controllable generation",

    "abstract": "Enabling robots to learn novel tasks in a data-efficient manner is a long-standing challenge. Common strategies involve carefully leveraging prior experiences, especially transition data collected on related tasks. Although much progress has been made for general pick-and-place manipulation, far fewer studies have investigated contact-rich assembly tasks, where precise control is essential. We introduce SRSA} (Skill Retrieval and Skill Adaptation), a novel framework designed to address this problem by utilizing a pre-existing skill library containing policies for diverse assembly tasks. The challenge lies in identifying which skill from the library is most relevant for fine-tuning on a new task. Our key hypothesis is that skills showing higher zero-shot success rates on a new task are better suited for rapid and effective fine-tuning on that task. To this end, we propose to predict the transfer success for all skills in the skill library on a novel task, and then use this prediction to guide the skill retrieval process. We establish a framework that jointly captures features of object geometry, physical dynamics, and expert actions to represent the tasks, allowing us to efficiently learn the transfer success predictor. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SRSA significantly outperforms the leading baseline. When retrieving and fine-tuning skills on unseen tasks, SRSA achieves a 19% relative improvement in success rate, exhibits 2.6x lower standard deviation across random seeds, and requires 2.4x fewer transition samples to reach a satisfactory success rate, compared to the baseline. In a continual learning setup, SRSA efficiently learns policies for new tasks and incorporates them into the skill library, enhancing future policy learning. Furthermore, policies trained with SRSA in simulation achieve a 90% mean success rate when deployed in the real world. Please visit our project webpage https://srsa2024.github.io/",

    "title": "SVDQuant: Absorbing Outliers by Low-Rank Component for 4-Bit Diffusion Models",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models can effectively generate high-quality images. However, as they scale, rising memory demands and higher latency pose substantial deployment challenges. In this work, we aim to accelerate diffusion models by quantizing their weights and activations to 4 bits. At such an aggressive level, both weights and activations are highly sensitive, where existing post-training quantization methods like smoothing become insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose *SVDQuant*, a new 4-bit quantization paradigm. Different from smoothing, which redistributes outliers between weights and activations, our approach *absorbs* these outliers using a low-rank branch. We first consolidate the outliers by shifting them from activations to weights. Then, we use a high-precision, low-rank branch to take in the weight outliers with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), while a low-bit quantized branch handles the residuals. This process eases the quantization on both sides. However, naively running the low-rank branch independently incurs significant overhead due to extra data movement of activations, negating the quantization speedup. To address this, we co-design an inference engine *Nunchaku* that fuses the kernels of the low-rank branch into those of the low-bit branch to cut off redundant memory access. It can also seamlessly support off-the-shelf low-rank adapters (LoRAs) without re-quantization. Extensive experiments on SDXL, PixArt-$\\Sigma$, and FLUX.1 validate the effectiveness of SVDQuant in preserving image quality. We reduce the memory usage for the 12B FLUX.1 models by 3.5×, achieving 3.0× speedup over the 4-bit weight-only quantization (W4A16) baseline on the 16GB laptop 4090 GPU with INT4 precision.

Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion model. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to focus on lesion areas, we simplify the learning process and improve control over the output while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we tackle two major challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multi-peak and 2) multi-class lesions. We introduce two effective strategies: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition, enabling the controlled generation of high-quality lesions in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate lesion mask diffusion, allowing control over lesion size, location, and boundary, thus increasing lesion diversity.

To provide accurate guidance for Latent Diffusion Models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance, our model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text but also extends to other modalities as the pioneer attempt. Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules",

    "title": "Moner: Motion Correction in Undersampled Radial MRI with Unsupervised Neural Representation",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "Motion correction (MoCo) in radial MRI is a particularly challenging problem due to the unpredictability of subject movement. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MoCo algorithms often rely on extensive high-quality MR images to pre-train neural networks, which constrains the solution space and leads to outstanding image reconstruction results. However, the need for large-scale datasets significantly increases costs and limits model generalization. In this work, we propose Moner, an unsupervised MoCo method that jointly reconstructs artifact-free MR images and estimates accurate motion from undersampled, rigid motion-corrupted k-space data, without requiring any training data. Our core idea is to leverage the continuous prior of implicit neural representation (INR) to constrain this ill-posed inverse problem, facilitating optimal solutions. Specifically, we integrate a quasi-static motion model into the INR, granting its ability to correct subject's motion. To stabilize model optimization, we reformulate radial MRI reconstruction as a back-projection problem using the Fourier-slice theorem. Additionally, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine hash encoding strategy, significantly enhancing MoCo accuracy. Experiments on multiple MRI datasets show our Moner achieves performance comparable to SOTA MoCo techniques on in-domain data, while demonstrating significant improvements on out-of-domain data.

    "abstract": "Drug discovery is crucial for identifying candidate drugs for various diseases. However, its low success rate often results in a scarcity of annotations, posing a few-shot learning problem. Existing methods primarily focus on single-scale features, overlooking the hierarchical molecular structures that determine different molecular properties. To address these issues, we introduce Universal Matching Networks (UniMatch), a dual matching framework that integrates explicit hierarchical molecular matching with implicit task-level matching via meta- learning, bridging multi-level molecular representations and task-level generalization. Specifically, our approach explicitly captures structural features across multiple levels—atoms, substructures, and molecules—via hierarchical pooling and matching, facilitating precise molecular representation and comparison. Additionally, we employ a meta-learning strategy for implicit task-level matching, allowing the model to capture shared patterns across tasks and quickly adapt to new ones. This unified matching framework ensures effective molecular alignment while leveraging shared meta-knowledge for fast adaptation. Our experimental results demonstrate that UniMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol benchmarks, achieving improvements of 2.87% in AUROC and 6.52% in ∆AUPRC. UniMatch also shows excellent generalization ability on the Meta-MolNet benchmark",

    "abstract": "Images generated by text-to-image (T2I) models often exhibit visual biases and stereotypes of concepts such as culture and profession. Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: **(M1)** Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and **(M2)** WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: **(U1)** StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and **(U2)** SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes.

    "title": "Instance-dependent Early Stopping",
    "volume": "spotlight",
    "abstract": "In machine learning practice, early stopping has been widely used to regularize models and can save computational costs by halting the training process when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving. However, conventional early stopping applies the same stopping criterion to all instances without considering their individual learning statuses, which leads to redundant computations on instances that are already well-learned. To further improve the efficiency, we propose an Instance-dependent Early Stopping (IES) method that adapts the early stopping mechanism from the entire training set to the instance level, based on the core principle that once the model has mastered an instance, the training on it should stop. IES considers an instance as mastered if the second-order differences of its loss value remain within a small range around zero. This offers a more consistent measure of an instance's learning status compared with directly using the loss value, and thus allows for a unified threshold to determine when an instance can be excluded from further backpropagation. We show that excluding mastered instances from backpropagation can increase the gradient norms, thereby accelerating the decrease of the training loss and speeding up the training process. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that IES method can reduce backpropagation instances by 10%-50% while maintaining or even slightly improving the test accuracy and transfer learning performance of a model",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning on graph-structured data, yet the behavior of dropout in these models remains poorly understood. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of dropout in GCNs, revealing that its primary role differs fundamentally from standard neural networks - preventing oversmoothing rather than co-adaptation. We demonstrate that dropout in GCNs creates dimension-specific stochastic sub-graphs, leading to a form of structural regularization not present in standard neural networks. Our analysis shows that dropout effects are inherently degree-dependent, resulting in adaptive regularization that considers the topological importance of nodes. We provide new insights into dropout's role in mitigating oversmoothing and derive novel generalization bounds that account for graph-specific dropout effects. Furthermore, we analyze the synergistic interaction between dropout and batch normalization in GCNs, uncovering a mechanism that enhances overall regularization. Our theoretical findings are validated through extensive experiments on both node-level and graph-level tasks across 14 datasets. Notably, GCN with dropout and batch normalization outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the practical impact of our theoretical insights",

We explore how these concepts influence the model output in downstream image classification tasks and investigate how recent state-of-the-art prompt-based adaptation techniques change the association of model inputs to these concepts.

    "abstract": "In many science and engineering settings, system dynamics are characterized by governing partial differential equations (PDEs), and a major challenge is to solve inverse problems (IPs) where unknown PDE parameters are inferred based on observational data gathered under limited budget. Due to the high costs of setting up and running experiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE simulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters (e.g., sensor placements) to solve such IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design parameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical constraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials during the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend to require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials. Furthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the need for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the advantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs) in solving IPs for PDE-governed systems, such as its meshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work presents Physics-Informed Experimental Design (PIED), the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully differentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design parameters for IPs for one-shot deployments. PIED overcomes existing methods' computational bottlenecks through parallelized computation and meta-learning of PINN parameter initialization, and proposes novel methods to effectively take into account PINN training dynamics in optimizing the ED parameters. Through experiments based on noisy simulated data and even real world experimental data, we empirically show that given limited observation budget, PIED significantly outperforms existing ED methods in solving IPs, including for challenging settings where the inverse parameters are unknown functions rather than just finite-dimensional",

However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference.

This study highlights a major, yet so far overlooked opportunity for substantially improving tabular MLPs; namely, parameter-efficient ensembling -- a paradigm for imitating an ensemble of models with just one model. We start by describing TabM -- a simple model based on MLP and BatchEnsemble (an existing technique), improved with our custom modifications. Then, we perform a large scale evaluation of tabular DL architectures on public benchmarks in terms of both task performance and efficiency, which renders the landscape of tabular DL in a new light. In particular, we find that TabM outperforms prior tabular DL models, while the complexity of attention- and retrieval-based methods does not pay off. Lastly, we conduct a detailed empirical analysis, that sheds some light on the high performance of TabM. For example, we show that parameter-efficient ensembling is not an arbitrary trick, but rather a highly effective way to reduce overfitting and improve optimization dynamics of tabular MLPs. Overall, our work brings an impactful technique to tabular DL, analyses its behaviour, and advances the performance-efficiency tradeoff with TabM -- a simple and powerful baseline for researchers and practitioners",

    "abstract": "Mainstream test-time adaptation (TTA) techniques endeavor to mitigate distribution shifts via entropy minimization for multi-class classification, inherently increasing the probability of the most confident class. However, when encountering multi-label instances, the primary challenge stems from the varying number of labels per image, and prioritizing only the highest probability class inevitably undermines the adaptation of other positive labels. To address this issue, we investigate TTA within multi-label scenario (ML--TTA), developing Bound Entropy Minimization (BEM) objective to simultaneously increase the confidence of multiple top predicted labels. Specifically, to determine the number of labels for each augmented view, we retrieve a paired caption with yielded textual labels for that view. These labels are allocated to both the view and caption, called weak label set and strong label set with the same size k. Following this, the proposed BEM considers the highest top-k predicted labels from view and caption as a single entity, respectively, learning both view and caption prompts concurrently. By binding top-k predicted labels, BEM overcomes the limitation of vanilla entropy minimization, which exclusively optimizes the most confident class. Across the MSCOCO, VOC, and NUSWIDE multi-label datasets, our ML--TTA framework equipped with BEM exhibits superior performance compared to the latest SOTA methods, across various model architectures, prompt initialization, and varying label scenarios.

This enables the LLM to generate tool calls and arguments as part of its next token prediction capabilities, seamlessly blending tool invocation with language generation. Our framework allows the LLM to access and utilize a vast amount of tools with no additional retrieval step, significantly enhancing both performance and scalability. Experimental results with over 47,000 tools show that ToolGen not only achieves superior results in both tool retrieval and autonomous task completion but also sets the stage for a new era of AI agents that can adapt to tools across diverse domains. By fundamentally transforming tool retrieval into a generative process, ToolGen paves the way for more versatile, efficient, and autonomous AI systems.

Its core challenge is finding a generalizable and discriminative metric to distinguish between clean and various types of poisoned samples (e.g., various triggers, various poisoning ratios). Inspired by a common phenomenon in backdoor attacks that the backdoored model tend to map significantly different poisoned and clean samples within the target class to similar activation areas, we introduce a novel perspective of the circular distribution of the gradients w.r.t. sample activation, dubbed gradient circular distribution (GCD). And, we find two interesting observations based on GCD. One is that the GCD of samples in the target class is much more dispersed than that in the clean class. The other is that in the GCD of target class, poisoned and clean samples are clearly separated. Inspired by above two observations, we develop an innovative three-stage poisoned sample detection approach, called Activation Gradient based Poisoned sample Detection (AGPD). First, we calculate GCDs of all classes from the model trained on the untrustworthy dataset. Then, we identify the target class(es) based on the difference on GCD dispersion between target and clean classes. Last, we filter out poisoned samples within the identified target class(es) based on the clear separation between poisoned and clean samples.

To address sycophancy in LLMs, we analyze and model the problem through the lens of structured causal models (SCMs). We attribute sycophancy to LLMs' reliance on spurious correlations between user preferences and model outputs in this paper. Based on the proposed SCMs, we develop a novel framework, termed **CAUSM**, to mitigate sycophancy in LLMs by exploiting a significant causal signature. Specifically, we eliminate the spurious correlations embedded in the intermediate layers of LLMs through causally motivated head reweighting, and then calibrate the intra-head knowledge along the causal representation direction.

In this work, we investigate the properties of permutation equivalence and invariance in GNNs, particularly in relation to the inherent symmetry of ILP formulations. We reveal that the interaction between these two factors contributes to the difficulty of distinguishing between symmetric variables. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of feature augmentation and propose several guiding principles for constructing augmented features. Building on these principles, we develop an orbit-based augmentation scheme that first groups symmetric variables and then samples augmented features for each group from a discrete uniform distribution.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Effective treatment of cancer is a major challenge faced by healthcare providers, due to the highly individualized nature of patient responses to treatment. This is caused by the heterogeneity seen in cancer-causing alterations (mutations) across patient genomes. Limited availability of response data in patients makes it difficult to train personalized treatment recommendation models on mutations from clinical genomic sequencing reports. Prior methods tackle this by utilising larger, labelled pre-clinical laboratory datasets (‘cell lines'), via transfer learning. These methods augment patient data by learning a shared, domain-invariant representation, between the cell line and patient domains, which is then used to train a downstream drug response prediction (DRP) model. This approach augments data in the shared space but fails to model patient-specific characteristics, which have a strong influence on their drug response. We propose a novel generative attention-based data augmentation and predictive modeling framework, GANDALF, to tackle this crucial shortcoming of prior methods. GANDALF not only augments patient genomic data directly, but also accounts for its domain-specific characteristics. GANDALF outperforms state-of-the-art DRP models on publicly available patient datasets and emerges as the front-runner amongst SOTA cancer DRP models",

However, the limited expressive capacity of LoRA, stemming from the low-rank constraint, has been recognized as a bottleneck, particularly in rigorous tasks like code generation and mathematical reasoning. To address this limitation, we introduce Rank-Sharing Low-Rank Adaptation (RaSA), an innovative extension that enhances the expressive capacity of LoRA by leveraging partial rank sharing across layers. By forming a shared rank pool and applying layer-specific weighting, RaSA effectively increases the number of ranks without augmenting parameter overhead. Our theoretically grounded and empirically validated approach demonstrates that RaSA not only maintains the core advantages of LoRA but also significantly boosts performance in challenging code and math tasks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Speech language models (SpeechLMs) accept speech input and produce speech output, allowing for more natural human-computer interaction compared to text-based large language models (LLMs). Traditional approaches for developing SpeechLMs are constrained by the limited availability of unsupervised speech data and parallel speech-text data, which are significantly less abundant compared to text pre-training data, thereby limiting their scalability as LLMs. We propose a novel approach to scaling speech-text pre-training by leveraging large-scale synthetic interleaved data derived from text corpora, eliminating the need for parallel speech-text datasets. Our method efficiently constructs speech-text interleaved data by sampling text spans from existing text corpora and synthesizing corresponding speech spans using a text-to-token model, bypassing the need to generate actual speech. We also employ a supervised speech tokenizer derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model by incorporating a vector-quantized bottleneck into the encoder. This supervised training approach results in discrete speech tokens with strong semantic preservation even at lower sampling rates (e.g. 12.5Hz), while still maintaining speech reconstruction quality. Starting from a pre-trained language model and scaling our pre-training to 1 trillion tokens (with 600B synthetic interleaved speech-text data), we achieve state-of-the-art performance in both speech language modeling and spoken question answering, improving performance on spoken questions tasks from the previous SOTA of 13\\% (Moshi) to 31\\%. We further demonstrate that by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with speech dialogue data, we can develop an end-to-end spoken chatbot that achieves competitive performance comparable to existing baselines in both conversational abilities and speech quality, even operating exclusively in the speech domain",

    "title": "Offline Model-Based Optimization by Learning to Rank",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to identify a design that maximizes a black-box function using only a fixed, pre-collected dataset of designs and their corresponding scores. This problem has garnered significant attention from both scientific and industrial domains. A common approach in offline MBO is to train a regression-based surrogate model by minimizing mean squared error (MSE) and then find the best design within this surrogate model by different optimizers (e.g., gradient ascent). However, a critical challenge is the risk of out-of-distribution errors, i.e., the surrogate model may typically overestimate the scores and mislead the optimizers into suboptimal regions. Prior works have attempted to address this issue in various ways, such as using regularization techniques and ensemble learning to enhance the robustness of the model, but it still remains. In this paper, we argue that regression models trained with MSE are not well-aligned with the primary goal of offline MBO, which is to \\textit{select} promising designs rather than to predict their scores precisely. Notably, if a surrogate model can maintain the order of candidate designs based on their relative score relationships, it can produce the best designs even without precise predictions. To validate it, we conduct experiments to compare the relationship between the quality of the final designs and MSE, finding that the correlation is really very weak. In contrast, a metric that measures order-maintaining quality shows a significantly stronger correlation. Based on this observation, we propose learning a ranking-based model that leverages learning to rank techniques to prioritize promising designs based on their relative scores. We show that the generalization error on ranking loss can be well bounded. Empirical results across diverse tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ranking-based method than twenty existing methods.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Algorithmic Recourse provides recommendations to individuals who are adversely impacted by automated model decisions, on how to alter their profiles to achieve a favorable outcome. Effective recourse methods must balance three conflicting goals: proximity to the original profile to minimize cost, plausibility for realistic recourse, and validity to ensure the desired outcome. We show that existing methods train for these objectives separately and then search for recourse through a joint optimization over the recourse goals during inference, leading to poor recourse recommendations. We introduce GenRe, a generative recourse model designed to train the three recourse objectives jointly. Training such generative models is non-trivial due to lack of direct recourse supervision. We propose efficient ways to synthesize such supervision and further show that GenRe's training leads to a consistent estimator. Unlike most prior methods, that employ non-robust gradient descent based search during inference, GenRe simply performs a forward sampling over the generative model to produce minimum cost recourse, leading to superior performance across multiple metrics. We also demonstrate GenRe provides the best trade-off between cost, plausibility and validity, compared to state-of-art baselines.

Recently, efforts have been made to develop neural ODE-based architectures to model the evolution of hidden states continuously in time, to address irregularly sampled sequence data. However, they assume a fixed architectural depth and limit their flexibility to adapt to data sets with varying complexities. We propose the neural wave equation, a novel deep learning method inspired by the wave equation, to address this through continuous modeling of depth. Neural Wave Equation models the evolution of hidden states continuously across time as well as depth by using a non-homogeneous wave equation parameterized by a neural network. Through d'Alembert's analytical solution of the wave equation, we also show that the neural wave equation provides denser connections across the hidden states, allowing for better modeling capability.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant attention for its ability to learn effective policies from pre-collected datasets without the need for further environmental interactions. While promising results have been demonstrated in single-agent settings, offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) presents additional challenges due to the large joint state-action space and the complexity of multi-agent behaviors. A key issue in offline RL is the distributional shift, which arises when the target policy being optimized deviates from the behavior policy that generated the data. This problem is exacerbated in MARL due to the interdependence between agents' local policies and the expansive joint state-action space. Prior approaches have primarily addressed this challenge by incorporating regularization in the space of either Q-functions or policies. In this work, we propose a novel type of regularizer in the space of stationary distributions to address the distributional shift more effectively. Our algorithm, ComaDICE, provides a principled framework for offline cooperative MARL to correct the stationary distribution of the global policy, which is then leveraged to derive local policies for individual agents. Through extensive experiments on the offline multi-agent MuJoCo and StarCraft II benchmarks, we demonstrate that ComaDICE achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art offline MARL methods across nearly all tasks",

While exact conditional guarantees are infeasible without assumptions on the underlying data distribution, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that depend on the total variation distance of the conditional distribution and its estimate.

    "abstract": "Diagnosing the root cause of an anomaly in a complex interconnected system is a pressing problem in today's cloud services and industrial operations. We propose In-Distribution Interventions (IDI), a novel algorithm that predicts root cause as nodes that meet two criteria: 1) Anomaly: root cause nodes should take on anomalous values; 2) Fix: had the root cause nodes assumed usual values, the target node would not have been anomalous. Prior methods of assessing the fix condition rely on counterfactuals inferred from a Structural Causal Model (SCM) trained on historical data. But since anomalies are rare and fall outside the training distribution, the fitted SCMs yield unreliable counterfactual estimates. IDI overcomes this by relying on interventional estimates obtained by solely probing the fitted SCM at in-distribution inputs. We present a theoretical analysis comparing and bounding the errors in assessing the fix condition using interventional and counterfactual estimates. We then conduct experiments by systematically varying the SCM's complexity to demonstrate the cases where IDI's interventional approach outperforms the counterfactual approach and vice versa. Experiments on both synthetic and PetShop RCD benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDI consistently identifies true root causes more accurately and robustly than nine existing state-of-the-art RCD baselines.

In this paper, we focus on a specific problem of feature sensitivity for additive decision tree ensembles and build a formal verification framework for a parametrized variant of it, where we also take into account the confidence of the tree ensemble in its output. We start by showing theoretical (NP-)hardness of the problem and explain how it relates to other verification problems.

    "abstract": "The impact of communication on decision-making systems has been extensively studied under the assumption of dedicated communication channels. We instead consider communicating through actions, where the message is embedded into the actions of an agent which interacts with the environment in a Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We conceptualize the MDP environment as a finite-state channel (FSC), where the actions of the agent serve as the channel input, while the states of the MDP observed by another agent (i.e., receiver) serve as the channel output. Here, we treat the environment as a communication channel over which the agent communicates through its actions, while at the same time, trying to maximize its reward. We first characterize the optimal information theoretic trade-off between the average reward and the rate of reliable communication in the infinite-horizon regime. Then, we propose a novel framework to design a joint control/coding policy, termed Act2Comm, which seamlessly embeds messages into actions. From a communication perspective, Act2Comm functions as a learning-based channel coding scheme for non-differentiable FSCs under input-output constraints. From a control standpoint, Act2Comm learns an MDP policy that incorporates communication capabilities, though at the cost of some control performance. Overall, Act2Comm effectively balances the dual objectives of control and communication in this environment. Experimental results validate Act2Comm's capability to enable reliable communication while maintaining a certain level of control performance",

Intuitively, VC-dimension is a measure of the size of a class of sets. The famous $\\varepsilon$-net theorem, a fundamental result in Discrete Geometry, asserts that if the VC-dimension of a set system is bounded, then a small sample exists that intersects all sufficiently large sets. In online learning scenarios where data arrives sequentially, the VC-dimension helps to bound the complexity of the set system, and $\\varepsilon$-nets ensure the selection of a small representative set. This sampling framework is crucial in various domains, including spatial data analysis, motion planning in dynamic environments, optimization of sensor networks, and feature extraction in computer vision, among others. Motivated by these applications, we study the online $\\varepsilon$-net problem for geometric concepts with bounded VC-dimension. While the offline version of this problem has been extensively studied, surprisingly, there are no known theoretical results for the online version to date. We present the first deterministic online algorithm with an optimal competitive ratio for intervals in $\\mathbb{R}$. Next, we give a randomized online algorithm with a near-optimal competitive ratio for axis-aligned boxes in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\\le 3$. Furthermore, we introduce a novel technique to analyze similar-sized objects of constant description complexity in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which may be of independent interest.

Although online piercing set is a very well-studied problem in the literature, to our surprise, very few works have addressed generic geometric concepts without any assumption about the sizes.

This requires the SiMT model to learn a read/write policy, deciding when to translate and when to wait for more source input. Numerous linguistic studies indicate that audiences in SiMT scenarios have distinct preferences, such as accurate translations, simpler syntax, and no unnecessary latency. Aligning SiMT models with these human preferences is crucial to improve their performances. However, this issue still remains unexplored. Additionally, preference optimization for SiMT task is also challenging. Existing methods focus solely on optimizing the generated responses, ignoring human preferences related to latency and the optimization of read/write policy during the preference optimization phase. To address these challenges, we propose Simultaneous Preference Learning (SimulPL), a preference learning framework tailored for the SiMT task. In the SimulPL framework, we categorize SiMT human preferences into five aspects: **translation quality preference**, **monotonicity preference**, **key point preference**, **simplicity preference**, and **latency preference**. By leveraging the first four preferences, we construct human preference prompts to efficiently guide GPT-4/4o in generating preference data for the SiMT task. In the preference optimization phase, SimulPL integrates **latency preference** into the optimization objective and enables SiMT models to improve the read/write policy, thereby aligning with human preferences more effectively. Experimental results indicate that SimulPL exhibits better alignment with human preferences across all latency levels in Zh$\\rightarrow$En, De$\\rightarrow$En and En$\\rightarrow$Zh SiMT tasks.

    "title": "Drop-Upcycling: Training Sparse Mixture of Experts with Partial Re-initialization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture reduces the training and inference cost significantly compared to a dense model of equivalent capacity. Upcycling is an approach that initializes and trains an MoE model using a pre-trained dense model. While upcycling leads to initial performance gains, the training progresses slower than when trained from scratch, leading to suboptimal performance in the long term. We propose Drop-Upcycling - a method that effectively addresses this problem. Drop-Upcycling combines two seemingly contradictory approaches: utilizing the knowledge of pre-trained dense models while statistically re-initializing some parts of the weights. This approach strategically promotes expert specialization, significantly enhancing the MoE model's efficiency in knowledge acquisition. Extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that Drop-Upcycling significantly outperforms previous MoE construction methods in the long term, specifically when training on hundreds of billions of tokens or more. As a result, our MoE model with 5.9B active parameters achieves comparable performance to a 13B dense model in the same model family, while requiring approximately 1/4 of the training FLOPs. All experimental resources, including source code, training data, model checkpoints and logs, are publicly available to promote reproducibility and future research on MoE",

    "title": "Black-Box Detection of Language Model Watermarks",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Watermarking has emerged as a promising way to detect LLM-generated text, by augmenting LLM generations with later detectable signals. Recent work has proposed multiple families of watermarking schemes, several of which focus on preserving the LLM distribution. This distribution-preservation property is motivated by the fact that it is a tractable proxy for retaining LLM capabilities, as well as the inherently implied undetectability of the watermark by downstream users. Yet, despite much discourse around undetectability, no prior work has investigated the practical detectability of any of the current watermarking schemes in a realistic black-box setting. In this work we tackle this for the first time, developing rigorous statistical tests to detect the presence, and estimate parameters, of all three popular watermarking scheme families, using only a limited number of black-box queries. We experimentally confirm the effectiveness of our methods on a range of schemes and a diverse set of open-source models. Further, we validate the feasibility of our tests on real-world APIs. Our findings indicate that current watermarking schemes are more detectable than previously believed",

    "title": "ProAdvPrompter: A Two-Stage Journey to Effective Adversarial Prompting for LLMs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various real-world applications, the identification of their vulnerabilities to jailbreaking attacks becomes an essential component of ensuring the safety and reliability of LLMs. Previous studies have developed LLM assistants, known as the adversarial prompter, to automatically generate suffixes that manipulate target LLMs into generating harmful and undesirable outputs. However, these approaches often suffer from low performance or generate semantically meaningless prompts, which can be easily identified by perplexity-based defenses. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage method, $\\texttt{ProAdvPrompter}$, that significantly improves the performance of adversarial prompters. In $\\texttt{ProAdvPrompter}$, the first stage (Exploration) utilizes the loss information to guide the adversarial prompter in generating suffixes that are more likely to elicit harmful responses. Then the second stage (Exploitation) iteratively fine-tunes the prompter using high-quality generated adversarial suffixes to further boost performance. Additionally, we incorporate the prompt template to aid in the Exploration stage and propose a filtering mechanism to accelerate the training process in the Exploitation stage. We evaluate $\\texttt{ProAdvPrompter}$ against the well-aligned LLMs (i.e., Llama2-Chat-7B and Llama3-chat-8B), achieving attack success rates of 99.68% and 97.12% respectively after 10 trials on the AdvBench dataset, thereby enhancing performance by $\\sim 2$ times compared to previous works. Moreover, $\\texttt{ProAdvPrompter}$ reduces training time by 20% on Llama3-Instruct-8B, generates more generalized adversarial suffixes, and demonstrates resilience against the perplexity defense. An ablation study further evaluates the effects of key components in $\\texttt{ProAdvPrompter}$ (the prompt template and the filtering mechanism)",

    "title": "SCOPE: A Self-supervised Framework for Improving Faithfulness in Conditional Text Generation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), when used for conditional text generation, often produce hallucinations, i.e., information that is unfaithful or not grounded in the input context. This issue arises in typical conditional text generation tasks, such as text summarization and data-to-text generation, where the goal is to produce fluent text based on contextual input. When fine-tuned on specific domains, LLMs struggle to provide faithful answers to a given context, often adding information or generating errors. One underlying cause of this issue is that LLMs rely on statistical patterns learned from their training data. This reliance can interfere with the model's ability to stay faithful to a provided context, leading to the generation of ungrounded information. We build upon this observation and introduce a novel self-supervised method for generating a training set of unfaithful samples. We then refine the model using a training process that encourages the generation of grounded outputs over unfaithful ones, drawing on preference-based training. Our approach leads to significantly more grounded text generation, outperforming existing self-supervised techniques in faithfulness, as evaluated through automatic metrics, LLM-based assessments, and human evaluations",

    "abstract": "Estimating the clique number in a graph is central to various applications, e.g., community detection, graph retrieval, etc. Existing estimators often rely on non-differentiable combinatorial components. Here, we propose a full differentiable estimator for clique number estimation, which can be trained from distant supervision of clique numbers, rather than demonstrating actual cliques. Our key insight is a formulation of the maximum clique problem (MCP) as a maximization of the size of fully dense square submatrix, within a suitably row-column-permuted adjacency matrix. We design a differentiable mechanism to search for permutations that lead to the discovery of such dense blocks. However, the optimal permutation is not unique, which leads to the learning of spurious permutations. To tackle this problem, we view the MCP problem as a sequence of subgraph matching tasks, each detecting progressively larger cliques in a nested manner. This allows effective navigation through suitable node permutations. These steps result in MxNet, an end-to-end differentiable model, which learns to predict clique number without explicit clique demonstrations, with the added benefit of interpretability. Experiments on eight datasets show the superior accuracy of our approach",

    "abstract": "Mastering medical knowledge is crucial for medical-specific LLMs. However, despite the existence of medical benchmarks like MedQA, a unified framework that fully leverages existing knowledge bases to evaluate LLMs' mastery of medical knowledge is still lacking. We propose PretexEval, a novel framework that dynamically generates reliable and diverse test samples to evaluate LLMs for any given medical knowledge base. We notice that test samples produced directly from knowledge bases by templates or LLMs may introduce factual errors and also lack diversity. To address these issues, our framework employs predicate equivalence transformations to produce a series of variants for any given medical knowledge point. Finally, these produced predicate variants are converted into textual language, resulting in a series of reliable and diverse test samples. Here, we use our proposed framework to systematically investigate the mastery of medical factual knowledge of 12 well-known LLMs, based on two knowledge bases that are crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The evaluation results illustrate that current LLMs still exhibit significant deficiencies in fully mastering medical knowledge, despite achieving considerable success on some famous public benchmarks.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Software engineers operating in complex and dynamic environments must continuously adapt to evolving requirements, learn iteratively from experience, and reconsider their approaches based on new insights. However, current large language model (LLM)-based software agents often follow linear, sequential processes that prevent backtracking and exploration of alternative solutions, limiting their ability to rethink their strategies when initial approaches prove ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SWE-Search, a multi-agent framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a self-improvement mechanism to enhance software agents' performance on repository-level software tasks. SWE-Search extends traditional MCTS by incorporating a hybrid value function that leverages LLMs for both numerical value estimation and qualitative evaluation. This enables self-feedback loops where agents iteratively refine their strategies based on both quantitative numerical evaluations and qualitative natural language assessments of pursued trajectories. The framework includes a SWE-Agent for adaptive exploration, a Value Agent for iterative feedback, and a Discriminator Agent that facilitates multi-agent debate for collaborative decision-making. Applied to the SWE-bench benchmark, our approach demonstrates a 23% relative improvement in performance across five models compared to standard open-source agents without MCTS. Our analysis reveals how performance scales with increased inference-time compute through deeper search, providing a pathway to improve software agents without requiring larger models or additional training data. This highlights the potential of self-evaluation driven search techniques in complex software engineering environments",

Then, within this setting, we develop a novel LLM-based adversarial anonymization framework leveraging the strong inferential capabilities of LLMs to inform our anonymization procedure. We conduct a comprehensive experimental evaluation of adversarial anonymization across 13 LLMs on real-world and synthetic online texts, comparing it against multiple baselines and industry-grade anonymizers.

    "title": "ADAM: An Embodied Causal Agent in Open-World Environments",

    "abstract": "In open-world environments like Minecraft, existing agents face challenges in continuously learning structured knowledge, particularly causality. These challenges stem from the opacity inherent in black-box models and an excessive reliance on prior knowledge during training, which impair their interpretability and generalization capability. To this end, we introduce ADAM, An emboDied causal Agent in Minecraft, which can autonomously navigate the open world, perceive multimodal context, learn causal world knowledge, and tackle complex tasks through lifelong learning. ADAM is empowered by four key components: 1) an interaction module, enabling the agent to execute actions while recording the interaction processes; 2) a causal model module, tasked with constructing an ever-growing causal graph from scratch, which enhances interpretability and reduces reliance on prior knowledge; 3) a controller module, comprising a planner, an actor, and a memory pool, using the learned causal graph to accomplish tasks; 4) a perception module, powered by multimodal large language models, enabling ADAM to perceive like a human player. Extensive experiments show that ADAM constructs a nearly perfect causal graph from scratch, enabling efficient task decomposition and execution with strong interpretability. Notably, in the modified Minecraft game where no prior knowledge is available, ADAM excels with remarkable robustness and generalization capability. ADAM pioneers a novel paradigm that integrates causal methods and embodied agents synergistically. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/ADAM",

In multi-agent settings, a priori known symmetries have been shown to address a fundamental coordination failure mode known as mutually incompatible symmetry breaking; e.g. in a game where two independent agents can choose to move \"left\" or \"right\", and where a reward of +1 or -1 is received when the agents choose the same action or different actions, respectively. However, the efficient and automatic discovery of environment symmetries, in particular for decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes, remains an open problem. Furthermore, environmental symmetry breaking constitutes only one type of coordination failure, which motivates the search for a more accessible and broader symmetry class. In this paper, we introduce such a broader group of previously unexplored symmetries, which we call expected return symmetries, which contains environment symmetries as a subgroup. We show that agents trained to be compatible under the group of expected return symmetries achieve better zero-shot coordination results than those using environment symmetries. As an additional benefit, our method makes minimal a priori assumptions about the structure of their environment and does not require access to ground truth symmetries",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are widely applied across various fields, model compression has become increasingly crucial for reducing costs and improving inference efficiency. Post-training pruning is a promising method that does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a small amount of calibration data to assess the importance of parameters. Recent research has enhanced post-training pruning from different aspects but few of them systematically explore the effects of calibration data, and it is unclear if there exist better calibration data construction strategies. We fill this blank and surprisingly observe that calibration data is also crucial to post-training pruning, especially for high sparsity. Through controlled experiments on important influence factors of calibration data, including the pruning settings, the amount of data, and its similarity with pre-training data, we observe that a small size of data is adequate, and more similar data to its pre-training stage can yield better performance. As pre-training data is usually inaccessible for advanced LLMs, we further provide a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data. Experimental results on recent strong open-source LLMs (e.g., DCLM, and LLaMA-3) show that the proposed strategy can enhance the performance of strong pruning methods (e.g., Wanda, DSnoT, OWL) by a large margin (up to 2.68%)",

    "abstract": "Proteins are essential macromolecules defined by their amino acid sequences, which determine their three-dimensional structures and, consequently, their functions in all living organisms. Therefore, generative protein modeling necessitates a multimodal approach to simultaneously model, understand, and generate both sequences and structures. However, existing methods typically use separate models for each modality, limiting their ability to capture the intricate relationships between sequence and structure. This results in suboptimal performance in tasks that requires joint understanding and generation of both modalities. In this paper, we introduce DPLM-2, a multimodal protein foundation model that extends discrete diffusion protein language model (DPLM) to accommodate both sequences and structures. To enable structural learning with the language model, 3D coordinates are converted to discrete tokens using a lookup-free quantization-based tokenizer. By training on both experimental and high-quality synthetic structures, DPLM-2 learns the joint distribution of sequence and structure, as well as their marginals and conditionals. We also implement an efficient warm-up strategy to exploit the connection between large-scale evolutionary data and structural inductive biases from pre-trained sequence-based protein language models. Empirical evaluation shows that DPLM-2 can simultaneously generate highly compatible amino acid sequences and their corresponding 3D structures eliminating the need for a two-stage generation approach. Moreover, DPLM-2 demonstrates competitive performance in various conditional generation tasks, including folding, inverse folding, and scaffolding with multimodal motif inputs",

However, performance of current LLM-based web agents in long-horizon tasks is far from optimal, often yielding errors such as repeatedly buying a non-refundable flight ticket. By contrast, humans can avoid such an irreversible mistake, as we have an awareness of the potential outcomes (e.g., losing money) of our actions, also known as the \"world model\". Motivated by this, our study first starts with preliminary analyses, confirming the absence of world models in current LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, etc.). Then, we present a World-model-augmented (WMA) web agent, which simulates the outcomes of its actions for better decision-making.

Generating synthetic datasets for training face recognition models has emerged as a promising alternative. However, the generation of synthetic datasets remains challenging as it entails adequate inter-class and intra-class variations. While advances in generative models have made it easier to increase intra-class variations in face datasets (such as pose, illumination, etc.), generating sufficient inter-class variation is still a difficult task. In this paper, we formulate the dataset generation as a packing problem on the embedding space (represented on a hypersphere) of a face recognition model and propose a new synthetic dataset generation approach, called HyperFace. We formalize our packing problem as an optimization problem and solve it with a gradient descent-based approach. Then, we use a conditional face generator model to synthesize face images from the optimized embeddings. We use our generated datasets to train face recognition models and evaluate the trained models on several benchmarking real datasets.

Thus, we propose $\\textit{Language Imbalance Driven Rewarding}$, where the inherent imbalance between dominant and non-dominant languages within LLMs is leveraged as a reward signal. Iterative DPO training demonstrates that this approach not only enhances LLM performance in non-dominant languages but also improves the dominant language's capacity, thereby yielding an iterative reward signal.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Modeling human-like action-to-reaction generation has significant real-world applications, like human-robot interaction and games. Despite recent advancements in single-person motion generation, it is still challenging to well handle action-to-reaction generation, due to the difficulty of directly predicting reaction from action sequence without prompts, and the absence of a unified representation that effectively encodes multi-person motion. To address these challenges, we introduce Think-Then-React (TTR), a large language-model-based framework designed to generate human-like reactions. First, with our fine-grained multimodal training strategy, TTR is capable to unify two processes during inference: a thinking process that explicitly infers action intentions and reasons corresponding reaction description, which serve as semantic prompts, and a reacting process that predicts reactions based on input action and the inferred semantic prompts. Second, to effectively represent multi-person motion in language models, we propose a unified motion tokenizer by decoupling egocentric pose and absolute space features, which effectively represents action and reaction motion with same encoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TTR outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements in evaluation metrics, such as reducing FID from 3.988 to 1.942",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at in-context learning (ICL) using just a few demonstrations, their performances are sensitive to demonstration orders. The reasons behind this sensitivity remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the prompt embedding space to bridge the gap between the order sensitivity of ICL with inner workings of decoder-only LLMs, uncovering the clustering property: prompts sharing the first and last demonstrations have closer embeddings, with first-demonstration clustering usually being stronger in practice. We explain this property through extensive theoretical analyses and empirical evidences. Our finding suggests that the positional encoding and the causal attention mask are key contributors to the clustering phenomenon. Leveraging this clustering insight, we introduce Cluster-based Search, a novel method that accelerates the selection and ordering of demonstrations in self-adaptive ICL settings. Our approach substantially decreases the time complexity from factorial to quadratic, saving 92% to nearly 100% execution time while maintaining comparable performance to exhaustive search",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the training and generalization performance of two-layer neural networks (NNs) after one gradient descent step under structured data modeled by Gaussian mixtures. While previous research has extensively analyzed this model under isotropic data assumption, such simplifications overlook the complexities inherent in real-world datasets. Our work addresses this limitation by analyzing two-layer NNs under Gaussian mixture data assumption in the asymptotically proportional limit, where the input dimension, number of hidden neurons, and sample size grow with finite ratios. We characterize the training and generalization errors by leveraging recent advancements in Gaussian universality. Specifically, we prove that a high-order polynomial model performs equivalent to the non-linear neural networks under certain conditions. The degree of the equivalent model is intricately linked to both the \"data spread\" and the learning rate employed during one gradient step. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the equivalence between the original model and its polynomial counterpart across various regression and classification tasks. Additionally, we explore how different properties of Gaussian mixtures affect learning outcomes. Finally, we illustrate experimental results on Fashion-MNIST classification, indicating that our findings can translate to realistic data",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Offline evaluation of LLMs is crucial in understanding their capacities, though current methods remain underexplored in existing research. In this work, we focus on the offline evaluation of the chain-of-thought capabilities and show how to optimize LLMs based on the proposed evaluation method. To enable offline feedback with rich knowledge and reasoning paths, we use knowledge graphs (KGs) (e.g., Wikidata5M) to provide feedback on the generated chain of thoughts. Due to the heterogeneity between LLM reasoning and KG structures, direct interaction and feedback from knowledge graphs on LLM behavior are challenging, as they require accurate entity linking and grounding of LLM-generated chains of thought in the KG. To address the above challenge, we propose an offline chain-of-thought evaluation framework, OCEAN, which models chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and evaluate the policy's alignment with KG preference modeling. To overcome the reasoning heterogeneity and grounding problems, we leverage on-policy KG exploration and reinforcement learning to model a KG policy that generates token-level likelihood distributions for LLM-generated chain-of-thought reasoning paths, simulating KG reasoning preference. Then we incorporate the knowledge-graph feedback on the validity and alignment of the generated reasoning paths into inverse propensity scores and propose KG-IPS estimator. Theoretically, we prove the unbiasedness of the proposed KG-IPS estimator and provide a lower bound on its variance. With the off-policy evaluated value function, we can directly enable off-policy optimization to further enhance chain-of-thought alignment. Our empirical study shows that OCEAN can be efficiently optimized for generating chain-of-thought reasoning paths with higher estimated values without affecting LLMs' general abilities in downstream tasks or their internal knowledge",

    "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainty is an essential part of predictive modeling, especially in the context of high-stakes decision-making. While classification output includes data uncertainty by design in the form of class probabilities, the regression task generally aims only to predict the expected value of the target variable. Probabilistic extensions often assume parametric distributions around the expected value, optimizing the likelihood over the resulting explicit densities. However, using parametric distributions can limit practical applicability, making it difficult for models to capture skewed, multi-modal, or otherwise complex distributions. In this paper, we propose optimizing a novel nondeterministic neural network regression architecture for loss functions derived from a sample-based approximation of the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), enabling a truly distribution-free approach by learning to sample from the target's aleatoric distribution, rather than predicting explicit densities. Our approach allows the model to learn well-calibrated, arbitrary uni- and multivariate output distributions. We evaluate the method on a variety of synthetic and real-world tasks, including uni- and multivariate problems, function inverse approximation, and standard regression uncertainty benchmarks.

    "title": "SOO-Bench: Benchmarks for Evaluating the Stability of Offline Black-Box Optimization",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Black-box optimization aims to find the optima through building a model close to the black-box objective function based on function value evaluation. However, in many real-world tasks, such as the design of molecular formulas and mechanical structures, it is perilous, costly, or even infeasible to evaluate the objective function value of an actively sampled solution. In this situation, optimization can only be conducted via utilizing offline historical data, which yields offline black-box optimization. Different from the traditional goal that is to pursue the optimal solution, this paper emphasizes that the goal of offline optimization is to stably surpass the offline dataset during optimization procedure. Although benchmarks called Design-Bench already exist in this emerging field, it can hardly evaluate the stability of offline optimization and mainly provides real-world offline tasks and the corresponding offline datasets. To this end, this paper proposes benchmarks named SOO-Bench (i.e., Stable Offline Optimization Benchmarks) for offline black-box optimization algorithms, so as to systematically evaluate the stability of surpassing the offline dataset under different data distributions. Along with SOO-Bench, we also propose a stability indicator to measure the degree of stability. Specifically, SOO-Bench includes various real-world offline optimization tasks and offline datasets under different data distributions, involving the fields of satellites, materials science, structural mechanics, and automobile manufacturing. Empirically, baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms are tested and analyzed on SOO-Bench. Hopefully, SOO-Bench is expected to serve as a catalyst for the rapid developments of more novel and stable offline optimization methods.

    "abstract": "Safety alignment for large language models (LLMs) has become a critical issue due to their rapid progress. However, our understanding of effective safety mechanisms in LLMs remains limited, leading to safety alignment training that mainly focuses on improving optimization, data-level enhancement, or adding extra structures to intentionally block harmful outputs. To address this gap, we develop a neuron detection method to identify safety neurons—those consistently crucial for handling and defending against harmful queries. Our findings reveal that these safety neurons constitute less than $1\\%$ of all parameters, are language-specific and are predominantly located in self-attention layers. Moreover, safety is collectively managed by these neurons in the first several layers. Based on these observations, we introduce a $\\underline{S}$afety $\\underline{N}$euron $\\underline{Tun}$ing method, named $\\texttt{SN-Tune}$, that exclusively tune safety neurons without compromising models' general capabilities. $\\texttt{SN-Tune}$ significantly enhances the safety of instruction-tuned models, notably reducing the harmful scores of Llama3-8B-Instruction from $65.5$ to $2.0$, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 from $70.8$ to $4.5$, and Vicuna-13B-1.5 from $93.5$ to $3.0$.

To achieve this, our method introduces the following technical designs. 1) We directly compress the activations (i.e. keys and values at every layer), rather than leveraging soft prompts to relay information (which constitute a major bottleneck to encapsulate the complex information within long contexts). 2) We tailor the compression workflow, where each fine-grained input unit is progressively compressed, enabling high-quality compression and efficient computation during both training and inference. 3) We train the model through compression-based auto-regression, making full use of plain texts and instructional data to optimize the model's compression performance. 4) During training, we randomly sample a compression ratio at each step, teaching the model to support a wide range of compression configurations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on various long-context tasks whose lengths (e.g., 128K) may far exceed the maximum training length (20K), such as document understanding, few-shot learning, and Needle-in-a-Haystack. Whilst existing methods struggle to handle these challenging tasks, Activation Beacon maintains a comparable performance to the uncompressed baseline across various scenarios, achieving a 2x acceleration in inference time and an 8x reduction of memory costs for KV cache",

However, these studies still bear some notable limitations, including a challenge to balance exploitation with exploration, often leading to inferior solution diversity, as well as poor generalizability of problem solving across different task settings. These unsolved issues render the prowess of LLMs in robot design automation largely untapped. In this work, we present LASeR -- Large Language Model-Aided Evolutionary Search for Robot Design Automation. Leveraging a novel reflection mechanism termed DiRect, we elicit more knowledgeable exploratory behaviors from LLMs based on past search trajectories, reshaping the exploration-exploitation tradeoff with dual improvements in optimization efficiency and solution diversity. Additionally, with evolution fully grounded in task-related background information, we unprecedentedly uncover the inter-task reasoning capabilities of LLMs, facilitating generalizable design processes that effectively inspire zero-shot robot proposals for new applications.

    "title": "Be More Diverse than the Most Diverse: Optimal Mixtures of Generative Models via Mixture-UCB Bandit Algorithms",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The availability of multiple training algorithms and architectures for generative models requires a selection mechanism to form a single model over a group of well-trained generation models. The selection task is commonly addressed by identifying the model that maximizes an evaluation score based on the diversity and quality of the generated data. However, such a best-model identification approach overlooks the possibility that a mixture of available models can outperform each individual model. In this work, we numerically show that a mixture of generative models on benchmark image datasets can indeed achieve a better evaluation score (based on FID and KID scores), compared to the individual models. This observation motivates the development of efficient algorithms for selecting the optimal mixture of the models. To address this, we formulate a quadratic optimization problem to find an optimal mixture model achieving the maximum of kernel-based evaluation scores including kernel inception distance (KID) and Rényi kernel entropy (RKE). To identify the optimal mixture of the models using the fewest possible sample queries, we view the selection task as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and propose the *Mixture Upper Confidence Bound (Mixture-UCB)* algorithm that provably converges to the optimal mixture of the involved models. More broadly, the proposed Mixture-UCB can be extended to optimize every convex quadratic function of the mixture weights in a general MAB setting. We prove a regret bound for the Mixture-UCB algorithm and perform several numerical experiments to show the success of Mixture-UCB in finding the optimal mixture of text and image generative models.

While arithmetic tasks are commonly used to study length generalization, certain tasks are considered notoriously difficult, e.g., multi-operand addition (requiring generalization over both the number of operands and their lengths) and multiplication (requiring generalization over both operand lengths). In this work, we achieve approximately 2–3× length generalization on both tasks, which is the first such achievement in arithmetic Transformers. We design task-specific scratchpads enabling the model to focus on a fixed number of tokens per each next-token prediction step, and apply multi-level versions of *Position Coupling* (Cho et al., 2024; McLeish et al., 2024) to let Transformers know the right position to attend to.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Model inversion attacks (MIAs) aim to reconstruct the private training data by accessing a public model, raising concerns about privacy leakage. Black-box MIAs, where attackers can only query the model and obtain outputs, are closer to real-world scenarios. The latest black-box attacks have outperformed the state-of-the-art white-box attacks, and existing defenses cannot resist them effectively. To fill this gap, we propose Stealthy Shield Defense (SSD), a post-processing algorithm against black-box MIAs. Our idea is to modify the model's outputs to minimize the conditional mutual information (CMI). We mathematically prove that CMI is a special case of information bottlenecks (IB), and thus inherits the advantages of IB---making predictions less dependent on inputs and more dependent on ground truths. This theoretically guarantees our effectiveness, both in resisting MIAs and preserving utility. For minimizing CMI, we formulate a convex optimization problem and solve it via the water-filling method. Adaptive rate-distortion is introduced to constrain the modification to the outputs, and the water-filling is implemented on GPUs to address computation cost. Without the need to retrain the model, our algorithm is plug-and-play and easy to deploy. Experimental results indicate that SSD outperforms existing defenses, in terms of MIA resistance and model's utility, across various attack algorithms, training datasets, and model architectures.

    "abstract": "When solving challenging problems, language models (LMs) are able to identify relevant information from long and complicated contexts. To study how LMs solve retrieval tasks in diverse situations, we introduce ORION, a collection of structured retrieval tasks spanning six domains, from text understanding to coding. Each task in ORION can be represented abstractly by a request (e.g. a question) that retrieves an attribute (e.g. the character name) from a context (e.g. a story). We apply causal analysis on 18 open-source language models with sizes ranging from 125 million to 70 billion parameters. We find that LMs internally decompose retrieval tasks in a modular way: middle layers at the last token position process the request, while late layers retrieve the correct entity from the context. After causally enforcing this decomposition, models are still able to solve the original task, preserving 70% of the original correct token probability in 98 of the 106 studied model-task pairs. We connect our macroscopic decomposition with a microscopic description by performing a fine-grained case study of a question-answering task on Pythia-2.8b. Building on our high-level understanding, we demonstrate a proof of concept application for scalable internal oversight of LMs to mitigate prompt-injection while requiring human supervision on only a single input. Our solution improves accuracy drastically (from 15.5% to 97.5% on Pythia-12b).

In this paper, we derive an empirical law that predicts pretraining loss for large language models for every intermediate training step across various learning rate schedules, including constant, cosine, and step decay schedules. Our proposed law takes a multi-power form, combining a power law based on the sum of learning rates and additional power laws to account for a loss reduction effect as learning rate decays. We validate this law extensively on Llama-2 models of varying sizes and demonstrate that, after fitting on a few learning rate schedules, it accurately predicts the loss curves for unseen schedules of different shapes and horizons. Moreover, by minimizing the predicted final pretraining loss across learning rate schedules, we are able to find a schedule that outperforms the widely-used cosine learning rate schedule. Interestingly, this automatically discovered schedule bears some resemblance to the recently proposed Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule (Hu et al, 2024) but achieves a slightly lower final loss.

Previous efforts towards efficient LMMs always focus on replacing the LLM backbone with smaller models, while neglecting the crucial issue of token quantity. In this paper, we introduce LLaVA-Mini, an efficient LMM with minimal vision tokens. To achieve a high compression ratio of vision tokens while preserving visual information, we first analyze how LMMs understand vision tokens and find that most vision tokens only play a crucial role in the early layers of LLM backbone, where they mainly fuse visual information into text tokens. Building on this finding, LLaVA-Mini introduces modality pre-fusion to fuse visual information into text tokens in advance, thereby facilitating the extreme compression of vision tokens fed to LLM backbone into one token. LLaVA-Mini is a unified large multimodal model that can support the understanding of images, high-resolution images, and videos in an efficient manner. Experiments across 11 image-based and 7 video-based benchmarks demonstrate that LLaVA-Mini outperforms LLaVA-v1.5 with just 1 vision token instead of 576. Efficiency analyses reveal that LLaVA-Mini can reduce FLOPs by 77%, deliver low-latency responses within 40 milliseconds, and process over 10,000 frames of video on the GPU hardware with 24GB of memory",

Nonetheless, the Korean NLP community lacks publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrating the faithfulness of knowledge-based information. Furthermore, the few existing datasets that evaluate hallucination are limited in their access to the entire dataset, restricting detailed analysis beyond simple scoring, and are based on translated English knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce K-HALU, a Korean benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' hallucination detection in Korean. This benchmark contains seven domains, considering the faithfulness of statements based on knowledge documents compiled from Korean news, magazines, and books. For more strict evaluation, 40% of the dataset is structured as multiple-answer questions, requiring models to select all possible correct answers from the given options. Our empirical results show that open-source LLMs still struggle with hallucination detection in Korean knowledge, emphasizing the need for a more detailed analysis of their limitations",

Our study of recent systems suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space, which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large performance benefits.

    "abstract": "We study continual learning on multiple linear classification tasks by sequentially running gradient descent (GD) for a fixed budget of iterations per each given task. When all tasks are jointly linearly separable and are presented in a cyclic/random order, we show the directional convergence of the trained linear classifier to the joint (offline) max-margin solution. This is surprising because GD training on a single task is implicitly biased towards the individual max-margin solution for the task, and the direction of the joint max-margin solution can be largely different from these individual solutions. Additionally, when tasks are given in a cyclic order, we present a non-asymptotic analysis on cycle-averaged forgetting, revealing that (1) alignment between tasks is indeed closely tied to catastrophic forgetting and backward knowledge transfer and (2) the amount of forgetting vanishes to zero as the cycle repeats. Lastly, we analyze the case where the tasks are no longer jointly separable and show that the model trained in a cyclic order converges to the unique minimum of the joint loss function",

We study this via layer pruning: if removing a certain layer does not affect model performance in common question-answering benchmarks, then the weights in that layer are not necessary for storing the knowledge needed to answer those questions. To find these unnecessary parameters, we identify the optimal block of layers to prune by considering similarity across layers; then, to \"heal\" the damage, we perform a small amount of finetuning. Surprisingly, with this method we find minimal degradation of performance until after a large fraction (up to half) of the layers are removed for some common open-weight models. From a scientific perspective, the robustness of these LLMs to the deletion of layers implies either that current pretraining methods are not properly leveraging the parameters in the deeper layers of the network or that the shallow layers play a critical role in storing knowledge.

    "abstract": "Utilizing a large-scale dataset is essential for training high-performance deep learning models, but it also comes with substantial computation and storage costs. To overcome these challenges, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising solution by compressing the large-scale dataset into a smaller synthetic dataset that retains the essential information needed for training. This paper proposes a novel parameterization framework for dataset distillation, coined Distilling Dataset into Neural Field (DDiF), which leverages the neural field to store the necessary information of the large-scale dataset. Due to the unique nature of the neural field, which takes coordinates as input and output quantity, DDiF effectively preserves the information and easily generates various shapes of data. We theoretically confirm that DDiF exhibits greater expressiveness than some previous literature when the utilized budget for a single synthetic instance is the same. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DDiF achieves superior performance on several benchmark datasets, extending beyond the image domain to include video, audio, and 3D voxel.

    "abstract": "The fairness of clustering algorithms has gained widespread attention across various areas, including machine learning, In this paper, we study fair $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space. Given a dataset comprising several groups, the fairness constraint requires that each cluster should contain a proportion of points from each group within specified lower and upper bounds. Due to these fairness constraints, determining the optimal locations of $k$ centers is a quite challenging task. We propose a novel ``Relax and Merge'' framework that returns a $(1+4\\rho + O(\\epsilon))$-approximate solution, where $\\rho$ is the approximate ratio of an off-the-shelf vanilla $k$-means algorithm and $O(\\epsilon)$ can be an arbitrarily small positive number. If equipped with a PTAS of $k$-means, our solution can achieve an approximation ratio of $(5+O(\\epsilon))$ with only a slight violation of the fairness constraints, which improves the current state-of-the-art approximation guarantee. Furthermore, using our framework, we can also obtain a $(1+4\\rho +O(\\epsilon))$-approximate solution for the $k$-sparse Wasserstein Barycenter problem, which is a fundamental optimization problem in the field of optimal transport, and a $(2+6\\rho)$-approximate solution for the strictly fair $k$-means clustering with no violation, both of which are better than the current state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform baseline approaches in terms of clustering cost",

This component focuses on testing models' ability to reason about sports solely through question-answering (QA), without requiring visual inputs; SPORTU-video, consisting of 1,701 slow-motion video clips across 7 different sports and 12,048 QA pairs, designed to assess multi-level reasoning, from simple sports recognition to complex tasks like foul detection and rule application.

GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy of 71\\%, but still falls short of human-level performance, highlighting room for improvement in rule comprehension and reasoning. The evaluation for the SPORTU-video part includes 6 proprietary and 8 open-source MLLMs. Experiments show that models fall short on hard tasks that require deep reasoning and rule-based understanding. GPT-4o performs the best with only 57.8\\% accuracy on the hard task, showing large room for improvement.

    "abstract": "Current AI frameworks for brain decoding and encoding, typically train and test models within the same datasets. This limits their utility for cognitive training (neurofeedback) for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies *not seen during training*. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function. Code \\& pre-trained models will be made available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/sim",

We theoretically prove the expressiveness of ICL models as learning algorithms and examine their learnability and generalizability. Our findings show that ICL with transformers can effectively construct data-dependent learning algorithms instead of directly follow existing ones (including gradient-based, metric-based, and amortization-based meta-learners). The construction of such learning algorithm is determined by the pre-training process, as a function fitting the training distribution, which raises generalizability as an important issue. With above understanding, we propose strategies to transfer techniques for classical deep networks to meta-level to further improve ICL.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF-LLMs) can over-rely on aligned preferences without truly gaining self-knowledge, leading to hallucination and biases. If an LLM can better access its knowledge and know what it knows, it can avoid making false or unsupported claims. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate whether LLMs have the ability to know what they know, as it can help to ensure accuracy and faithfulness in real-world applications. Inspired by research in Educational Psychology, surface learners who don't really know are easily affected by teacher and peer guidance, we treat LLM as a student, incorporate role guidance in prompts to explore whether LLMs really know. Specifically, we propose a novel strategy called Role-Guided and Self-Reflection (RoSe) to fully assess whether LLM \"knows it knows\". We introduce multiple combinations of different roles and strong reminder in prompts combined with self-reflection to explore what local information in prompt LLMs rely on and whether LLMs remain unaffected by external guidance with varying roles. Our findings reveal that LLMs are very sensitive to the strong reminder information. Role guidance can help LLMs reduce their reliance on strong reminder. Meanwhile, LLMs tend to trust the role of authority more when guided by different roles. Following these findings, we propose a double-calibrated strategy with verbalized confidence to extract well-calibrated data from closed-source LLM and fine-tune open-source LLMs. Extensive experiments conducted on fine-tuning open-source LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of double-calibrated strategy in mitigating the reliance of LLMs on local information.

However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters due to the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings where the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce maximal update parameterization ($\\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verify that $\\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis reveals unique and intriguing properties of $\\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we find that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer differing from classical $\\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime",

In this regime, clients are restricted to transmitting small amounts of compressed information to their neighbors over a communication graph. Numerous endeavors have been made to address this challenging problem by developing algorithms with compressed communication for decentralized non-convex optimization problems. Despite considerable efforts, current theoretical understandings of the problem are still very limited, and existing algorithms all suffer from various limitations. In particular, these algorithms typically rely on strong, and often infeasible assumptions such as bounded data heterogeneity or require large batch access while failing to achieve linear speedup with the number of clients. In this paper, we introduce MoTEF, a novel approach that integrates communication compression with $\\textbf{Mo}$mentum $\\textbf{T}$racking and $\\textbf{E}$rror $\\textbf{F}$eedback.

This poses a significant challenge for the models to generalize when the proportions of the groups shift during deployment. To improve robustness to such shifts, existing approaches have developed strategies that train models or perform hyperparameter tuning using the group-labeled data to minimize the worst-case loss over groups. However, a non-trivial amount of high-quality labels is often required to obtain noticeable improvements. Given the costliness of the labels, we propose to adopt a different paradigm to enhance group label efficiency: utilizing the group-labeled data as a target set to optimize the weights of other group-unlabeled data. We introduce Group-robust Sample Reweighting (GSR), a two-stage approach that first learns the representations from group-unlabeled data, and then tinkers the model by iteratively retraining its last layer on the reweighted data using influence functions. Our GSR is theoretically sound, practically lightweight, and effective in improving the robustness to sub- population shifts.

Our attack is extremely effective on a wide range of frontier language models. By controlling complexity parameters such as number of key-value mappings in the encodings, we find a close relationship between the capability level of the attacked LLM and the average complexity of the most effective bijection attacks.

    "abstract": "Automated mechanistic interpretation research has attracted great interest due to its potential to scale explanations of neural network internals to large models. Existing automated circuit discovery work relies on activation patching or its approximations to identify subgraphs in models for specific tasks (circuits). They often suffer from slow runtime, approximation errors, and specific requirements of metrics, such as non-zero gradients. In this work, we introduce contextual decomposition for transformers (CD-T) to build interpretable circuits in large language models. CD-T can produce circuits at any level of abstraction and is the first to efficiently produce circuits as fine-grained as attention heads at specific sequence positions. CD-T is compatible to all transformer types, and requires no training or manually-crafted examples. CD-T consists of a set of mathematical equations to isolate contribution of model features. Through recursively computing contribution of all nodes in a computational graph of a model using CD-T followed by pruning, we are able to reduce circuit discovery runtime from hours to seconds compared to state-of-the-art baselines. On three standard circuit evaluation datasets (indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring completion), we demonstrate that CD-T outperforms ACDC and EAP by better recovering the manual circuits with an average of 97% ROC AUC under low runtimes. In addition, we provide evidence that faithfulness of CD-T circuits is not due to random chance by showing our circuits are 80% more faithful than random circuits of up to 60% of the original model size. Finally, we show CD-T circuits are able to perfectly replicate original models' behavior(faithfulness = 1) using fewer nodes than the baselines for all tasks. Our results underscore the great promise of CD-T for efficient automated mechanistic interpretability, paving the way for new insights into the workings of large language models",

    "abstract": "As diffusion models are deployed in real-world settings and their performance driven by training data, appraising the contribution of data contributors is crucial to creating incentives for sharing quality data and to implementing policies for data compensation. Depending on the use case, model performance corresponds to various global properties of the distribution learned by a diffusion model (e.g., overall aesthetic quality). Hence, here we address the problem of attributing global properties of diffusion models to data contributors. The Shapley value provides a principled approach to valuation by uniquely satisfying game-theoretic axioms of fairness. However, estimating Shapley values for diffusion models is computationally impractical because it requires retraining and rerunning inference on many subsets of data contributors. We introduce a method to efficiently retrain and rerun inference for Shapley value estimation, by leveraging model pruning and fine-tuning. We evaluate the utility of our method with three use cases: (i) image quality for a DDPM trained on a CIFAR dataset, (ii) demographic diversity for an LDM trained on CelebA-HQ, and (iii) aesthetic quality for a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on Post-Impressionist artworks.

Current model pruning techniques attempt to alleviate these issues by relying heavily on external calibration datasets to determine which parameters to prune or compress, thus limiting their flexibility and scalability across different compression ratios. Moreover, these methods often cause severe performance degradation, particularly in downstream tasks, when subjected to higher compression rates. In this paper, we propose *PruneNet*, a novel model compression method that addresses these limitations by reformulating model pruning as a policy learning process. PruneNet decouples the pruning process from the model architecture, eliminating the need for calibration datasets. It learns a stochastic pruning policy to assess parameter importance solely based on intrinsic model properties while preserving the spectral structure to minimize information loss. PruneNet can compress the LLaMA-2-7B model in just 15 minutes, achieving over 80\\% retention of its zero-shot performance with a 30\\% compression ratio, outperforming existing methods that retain only 75\\% performance. Furthermore, on complex multitask language understanding tasks, PruneNet demonstrates its robustness by preserving up to 80\\% performance of the original model, proving itself a superior alternative to conventional structured compression techniques",

    "abstract": "Time series modeling presents unique challenges due to autocorrelation in both historical data and future sequences. While current research predominantly addresses autocorrelation within historical data, the correlations among future labels are often overlooked. Specifically, modern forecasting models primarily adhere to the Direct Forecast (DF) paradigm, generating multi-step forecasts independently and disregarding label correlations over time. In this work, we demonstrate that the learning objective of DF is biased in the presence of label correlation. To address this issue, we propose the Frequency-enhanced Direct Forecast (FreDF), which mitigates label correlation by learning to forecast in the frequency domain, thereby reducing estimation bias. Our experiments show that FreDF significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and is compatible with a variety of forecast models.

As the heart of the transformer, attention has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$, compared to $O(N)$ for linear transformations. When handling large sequence lengths, attention becomes the primary time-consuming component. Although quantization has proven to be an effective method for accelerating model inference, existing quantization methods primarily focus on optimizing the linear layer. In response, we first analyze the feasibility of quantization in attention detailedly. Following that, we propose SageAttention, a highly efficient and accurate quantization method for attention. The OPS (operations per second) of our approach outperforms FlashAttention2 and xformers by about 2.1x and 2.7x, respectively.

Specifically, LLMs often fail to adhere to original correct responses, instead blindly agreeing with users' opinions, even when those opinions are incorrect or malicious. However, research on sycophancy in visual language models (VLMs) has been scarce. In this work, we extend the exploration of sycophancy from LLMs to VLMs, introducing the MM-SY benchmark to evaluate this phenomenon. We present evaluation results from multiple representative models, addressing the gap in sycophancy research for VLMs. To mitigate sycophancy, we propose a synthetic dataset for training and employ methods based on prompts, supervised fine-tuning, and DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that these methods effectively alleviate sycophancy in VLMs. Additionally, we probe VLMs to assess the semantic impact of sycophancy and analyze the attention distribution of visual tokens. Our findings indicate that the ability to prevent sycophancy is predominantly observed in higher layers of the model. The lack of attention to image knowledge in these higher layers may contribute to sycophancy, and enhancing image attention at high layers proves beneficial in mitigating this issue",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) acquire substantial knowledge during pretraining but often need adaptation to new contexts, tasks, or domains, typically achieved through fine-tuning or prompting. However, fine-tuning incurs significant training costs, while prompting increases inference overhead. Inspired by fast weight memory, we introduce GenerativeAdapter, an effective and efficient adaptation method that encode test-time context into language model parameters with a single forward pass. GenerativeAdapter augments a frozen pretrained LM with a lightweight adapter generator, trained via self-supervised learning, to produce parameter-efficient adapters. Notably, our generator is general-purpose, i.e., one generator can adapt the corresponding base model for all langauge processing scenarios. We apply GenerativeAdapter to two pretrained LMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama2-7B-Chat) and evaluate the adapted models across knowledge acquisition from documents, learning from demonstrations, and personalization for users. In StreamingQA, our approach is effective in injecting knowledge into the LM's parameters, achieving a 63.5\\% improvement in F1 score over the model with supervised fine-tuning (from $19.5$ to $31.5$) for contexts as long as 32K tokens. In the MetaICL in-context learning evaluation, our method achieves an average accuracy of $44.9$ across 26 tasks, outperforming the base model. On MSC, our method proves to be highly competitive in memorizing user information from conversations with a 4x reduction in computation and memory costs compared to prompting with full conversation history. Overall, GenerativeAdapter provides a viable solution for adapting large LMs to evolving information and providing tailored user experience, while reducing training and inference costs relative to traditional fine-tuning and prompting techniques",

Given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn novel tasks, we ask whether models can flexibly alter their semantically grounded organization of concepts. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, can models infer these novel semantics and reorganize representations in accordance with them? To answer this question, we define a toy \"graph tracing\" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.), and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization of representations according to the graph's structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, which shows getting non-trivial performance on the task requires for the model to infer a connected component. Overall, our findings indicate context-size may be an underappreciated scaling axis that can flexibly re-organize model representations, unlocking novel capabilities",

The transformation of a polyhedron into a vector, known as polyhedra representation learning, is crucial for manipulating these shapes with mathematical and statistical tools for tasks like classification, clustering, and generation. Recent years have witnessed significant strides in this domain, yet most efforts focus on the vertex sequence of a polyhedron, neglecting the complex surface modeling crucial in real-world polyhedral objects. This study proposes \\textbf{PolyhedronNet}, a general framework tailored for learning representations of 3D polyhedral objects. We propose the concept of the surface-attributed graph to seamlessly model the vertices, edges, faces, and their geometric interrelationships within a polyhedron. To effectively learn the representation of the entire surface-attributed graph, we first propose to break it down into local rigid representations to effectively learn each local region's relative positions against the remaining regions without geometric information loss. Subsequently, we propose PolyhedronGNN to hierarchically aggregate the local rigid representation via intra-face and inter-face geometric message passing modules, to obtain a global representation that minimizes information loss while maintaining rotation and translation invariance. Our experimental evaluations on four distinct datasets, encompassing both classification and retrieval tasks, substantiate PolyhedronNet's efficacy in capturing comprehensive and informative representations of 3D polyhedral objects",

This way we enable data generation under safety constraints. We show that SafeDiffusers maintain the generative performance of diffusion models while also providing robustness in safe data generation.

    "abstract": "The human brain efficiently represents visual inputs through specialized neural populations that selectively respond to specific categories. Advancements in generative modeling have enabled data-driven discovery of neural selectivity using brain-optimized image synthesis. However, current methods independently generate one sample at a time, without enforcing structural constraints on the generations; thus, these individual images have no explicit point of comparison, making it hard to discern which image features drive neural response selectivity. To address this issue, we introduce Brain Activation Control Through Image Variation (BrainACTIV), a method for manipulating a reference image to enhance or decrease activity in a target cortical region using pretrained diffusion models. Starting from a reference image allows for fine-grained and reliable offline identification of optimal visuo-semantic properties, as well as producing controlled stimuli for novel neuroimaging studies. We show that our manipulations effectively modulate predicted fMRI responses and agree with hypothesized preferred categories in established regions of interest, while remaining structurally close to the reference image. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method accentuates differences between brain regions that are selective to the same category, and how it could be used to explore neural representation of brain regions with unknown selectivities. Hence, BrainACTIV holds the potential to formulate robust hypotheses about brain representation and to facilitate the production of naturalistic stimuli for neuroscientific experiments",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The modern paradigm in machine learning involves pre-training on diverse data, followed by task-specific fine-tuning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this translates to learning via offline RL on a diverse historical dataset, followed by rapid online RL fine-tuning using interaction data. Most RL fine-tuning methods require continued training on offline data for stability and performance. However, this is undesirable because training on diverse offline data is slow and expensive for large datasets, and should, in principle, also limit the performance improvement possible because of constraints or pessimism on offline data. In this paper, we show that retaining offline data is unnecessary as long as we use a properly-designed online RL approach for fine-tuning offline RL initializations. To build this approach, we start by analyzing the role of retaining offline data in online fine-tuning. We find that continued training on offline data is mostly useful for preventing a sudden divergence in the value function at the onset of fine-tuning, caused by a distribution mismatch between the offline data and online rollouts. This divergence typically results in unlearning and forgetting the benefits of offline pre-training. Our approach, Warm-start RL (WSRL), mitigates the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained initializations using a very simple idea. WSRL employs a warmup phase that seeds the online RL run with a very small number of rollouts from the pre-trained policy to do fast online RL. The data collected during warmup bridges the distribution mismatch, and helps ``recalibrate'' the offline Q-function to the online distribution, allowing us to completely discard offline data without destabilizing the online RL fine-tuning. We show that WSRL is able to fine-tune without retaining any offline data, and is able to learn faster and attains higher performance than existing algorithms irrespective of whether they do or do not retain offline data",

However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in exchange for optimal reward. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty — allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity.

To harness this rich prior knowledge for efficiently solving complex SDM tasks, we propose treating LLMs as prior action distributions and integrating them into RL frameworks through Bayesian inference methods, making use of variational inference and direct posterior sampling. The proposed approaches facilitate the seamless incorporation of fixed LLM priors into both policy-based and value-based RL frameworks.

To address this, we propose a new data-driven technique that tracks the geometric properties of the uncertainty ellipsoid around the main problem parameter. This methodology enables us to formulate a data-driven frequentist regret bound, which incorporates the geometric information, for a broad class of base algorithms, including Greedy, OFUL, and Thompson sampling.

    "abstract": "Scaling test-time compute to search for optimal solutions is an important step towards building generally-capable language models that can reason. Recent work, however, shows that tasks of varying complexity require distinct search strategies to solve optimally, thus making it challenging to design a one-size-fits-all approach. Prior solutions either attempt to predict task difficulty to select the optimal search strategy, often infeasible in practice, or use a static, pre-defined strategy, e.g., repeated parallel sampling or greedy sequential search, which is sub-optimal. In this work, we argue for an alternative view using the probabilistic framework of Bayesian optimization (BO), where the search strategy is adapted dynamically based on the evolving uncertainty estimates of solutions as search progresses. To this end, we introduce Bayesian-OPRO (BOPRO)––a generalization of a recent method for in-context optimization, which iteratively samples from new proposal distributions by modifying the prompt to the LLM with a subset of its previous generations selected to explore or exploit different parts of the search space. We evaluate our method on word search, molecule optimization, and a joint hypothesis+program search task using a 1-D version of the challenging Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (1D-ARC). Our results show that BOPRO outperforms all baselines in word search (≥10 points) and molecule optimization (higher quality and 17% fewer invalid molecules), but trails a best-k prompting strategy in program search. Our analysis reveals that despite the ability to balance exploration and exploitation using BOPRO, failure is likely due to the inability of code representation models in distinguishing sequences with low edit-distances",

For example, asking the model to explain Newton's second law with the context \"I am a toddler'' should produce a response different from when the context is \"I am a physics professor''. However, leveraging the context in practice is a nuanced and challenging task, and is often dependent on the specific situation or user base. The model must strike a balance between providing specific, personalized responses and maintaining general applicability. Current solutions, such as prompt-engineering and fine-tuning, require collection of contextually appropriate responses as examples, making them time-consuming and less flexible to use across different contexts. In this work, we introduce Context Steering (CoS) —a simple, training-free decoding approach that amplifies the influence of the context in next token predictions. CoS computes contextual influence by comparing the output probabilities from two LLM forward passes: one that includes the context and one that does not. By linearly scaling the contextual influence, CoS allows practitioners to flexibly control the degree of personalization for different use cases. We show that CoS can be applied to autoregressive LLMs, and demonstrates strong performance in personalized recommendations. Additionally, we show that CoS can function as a Bayesian Generative model to infer and quantify correlations between open-ended texts, broadening its potential applications",

    "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, classic on-policy evaluation methods often suffer from high variance and require massive online data to attain the desired accuracy. Previous studies attempt to reduce evaluation variance by searching for or designing proper behavior policies to collect data. However, these approaches ignore the safety of such behavior policies---the designed behavior policies have no safety guarantee and may lead to severe damage during online executions. In this paper, to address the challenge of reducing variance while ensuring safety simultaneously, we propose an optimal variance-minimizing behavior policy under safety constraints.

    "abstract": "We present Agent S, an open agentic framework that enables autonomous interaction with computers through Graphical User Interface (GUI), aimed at transforming human-computer interaction by automating complex, multi-step tasks. Agent S addresses three key challenges in automating computer tasks: acquiring domain-specific knowledge, planning over long task horizons, and handling dynamic, non-uniform interfaces. To this end, Agent S introduces experience-augmented hierarchical planning, which learns from external knowledge search and internal experience retrieval at multiple levels, facilitating efficient task planning and subtask execution. In addition, it employs an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) to better elicit the reasoning and control capabilities of GUI agents based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Evaluation on the OSWorld benchmark shows that Agent S outperforms the baseline by 9.37\\% on success rate (an 83.6\\% relative improvement) and achieves a new state-of-the-art. Comprehensive analysis highlights the effectiveness of individual components and provides insights for future improvements. Furthermore, Agent S demonstrates broad generalizability to different operating systems on a newly-released WindowsAgentArena benchmark. Code available at https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S",

While various efforts aim to address this safety concern, previous approaches often demand substantial human data collection or rely on the less dependable option of using another LLM to generate corrective data. In this paper, we aim to take this problem and overcome limitations of requiring significant high-quality human data. Our method requires only a small set of unsafe responses to toxic prompts, easily obtained from the unsafe LLM itself. By employing a semantic cost combined with a negative Earth Mover Distance (EMD) loss, we guide the LLM away from generating unsafe responses. Additionally, we propose a novel lower bound for EMD loss, enabling more efficient optimization.

    "abstract": "Recent research into solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has gained significant traction, particularly through the application of deep (reinforcement) learning for end-to-end solution construction. However, many current construction-based neural solvers predominantly utilize Transformer architectures, which can face scalability challenges and struggle to produce diverse solutions. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework beyond Transformer-based approaches, i.e., Adversarial Generative Flow Networks (AGFN). This framework integrates the generative flow network (GFlowNet)—a probabilistic model inherently adept at generating diverse solutions (routes)—with a complementary model for discriminating (or evaluating) the solutions. These models are trained alternately in an adversarial manner to improve the overall solution quality, followed by a proposed hybrid decoding method to construct the solution. We apply the AGFN framework to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and travelling salesman problem (TSP), and our experimental results demonstrate that AGFN surpasses the popular construction-based neural solvers, showcasing strong generalization capabilities on synthetic and real-world benchmark instances",

However, their widespread availability raises concerns about unauthorized usage and copyright infringement, where users or individuals can develop their own LVLMs by fine-tuning published models. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Parameter Learning Attack (PLA) for tracking the copyright of LVLMs without modifying the original model. Specifically, we construct adversarial images through targeted attacks against the original model, enabling it to generate specific outputs. To ensure these attacks remain effective on potential fine-tuned models to trigger copyright tracking, we allow the original model to learn the trigger images by updating parameters in the opposite direction during the adversarial attack process. Notably, the proposed method can be applied after the release of the original model, thus not affecting the model's performance and behavior. To simulate real-world applications, we fine-tune the original model using various strategies across diverse datasets, creating a range of models for copyright verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can more effectively identify the original copyright of fine-tuned models compared to baseline methods. Therefore, this work provides a powerful tool for tracking copyrights and detecting unlicensed usage of LVLMs",

Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "State space models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to Transformer models for language modeling, offering linear computational complexity and constant memory usage as context length increases. However, despite their efficiency in handling long contexts, recent studies have shown that SSMs, such as Mamba models, generally underperform compared to Transformers in long-context understanding tasks. To address this significant shortfall and achieve both efficient and accurate long-context understanding, we propose LongMamba, a training-free technique that significantly enhances the long-context capabilities of Mamba models. LongMamba builds on our discovery that the hidden channels in Mamba can be categorized into local and global channels based on their receptive field lengths, with global channels primarily responsible for long-context capability. These global channels can become the key bottleneck as the input context lengthens. Specifically, when input lengths largely exceed the training sequence length, global channels exhibit limitations in adaptively extend their receptive fields, leading to Mamba's poor long-context performance. The key idea of LongMamba is to mitigate the hidden state memory decay in these global channels by preventing the accumulation of unimportant tokens in their memory. This is achieved by first identifying critical tokens in the global channels and then applying token filtering to accumulate only those critical tokens. Through extensive benchmarking across synthetic and real-world long-context scenarios, LongMamba sets a new standard for Mamba's long-context performance, significantly extending its operational range without requiring additional training.

We consider the task of predicting a molecule's all-atom 3D structure given only its molecular formula and moments of inertia, motivated by the ability of rotational spectroscopy to measure these moments. While existing generative models can conditionally sample 3D structures with approximately correct moments, this soft conditioning fails to leverage the many digits of precision afforded by experimental rotational spectroscopy. To address this, we first show that the space of $n$-atom point clouds with a fixed set of moments of inertia is embedded in the Stiefel manifold $\\mathrm{St}(n, 4)$. We then propose Stiefel Flow Matching as a generative model for elucidating 3D structure under exact moment constraints. Additionally, we learn simpler and shorter flows by finding approximate solutions for equivariant optimal transport on the Stiefel manifold. Empirically, enforcing exact moment constraints allows Stiefel Flow Matching to achieve higher success rates and faster sampling than Euclidean diffusion models, even on high-dimensional manifolds corresponding to large molecules in the GEOM dataset",

Motivated by the advances in language modeling, empirical legal scholars are increasingly turning to commercial models, hoping that it will alleviate the significant cost of human annotation. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of large language models' current abilities to perform legal annotation tasks. To do so, we construct CaselawQA, a benchmark comprising 260 legal text classification tasks, nearly all new to the machine learning community.

We then demonstrate that small, lightly fine-tuned models vastly outperform commercial models. A few dozen to a few hundred labeled examples are usually enough to achieve higher accuracy. Our work points to a viable alternative to the predominant practice of prompting commercial models.

To explore the potential of LLMs in this direction, we propose OpenRCA, a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' ability to identify the root cause of software failures. OpenRCA includes 335 failures from three enterprise software systems, along with over 68 GB of telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces). Given a failure case and its associated telemetry, the LLM is tasked to identify the root cause that triggered the failure, requiring comprehension of software dependencies and reasoning over heterogeneous, long-context telemetry data. Our results show substantial room for improvement, as current models can only handle the simplest cases.

    "title": "Wavelet-based Positional Representation for Long Context",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In the realm of large-scale language models, a significant challenge arises when extrapolating sequences beyond the maximum allowable length. This is because the model's position embedding mechanisms are limited to positions encountered during training, thus preventing effective representation of positions in longer sequences. We analyzed conventional position encoding methods for long contexts and found the following characteristics. (1) When the representation dimension is regarded as the time axis, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) can be interpreted as a restricted wavelet transform using Haar-like wavelets. However, because it uses only a fixed scale parameter, it does not fully exploit the advantages of wavelet transforms, which capture the fine movements of non-stationary signals using multiple scales (window sizes). This limitation could explain why RoPE performs poorly in extrapolation. (2) Previous research as well as our own analysis indicates that Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) functions similarly to windowed attention, using windows of varying sizes. However, it has limitations in capturing deep dependencies because it restricts the receptive field of the model. From these insights, we propose a new position representation method that captures multiple scales (i.e., window sizes) by leveraging wavelet transforms without limiting the model's attention field. Experimental results show that this new method improves the performance of the model in both short and long contexts. In particular, our method allows extrapolation of position information without limiting the model's attention field",

However, as new and improved LLMs are developed, existing evaluation benchmarks (e.g., HumanEvla, MBPP) are no longer sufficient for assessing their capabilities suffering from data contamination, overfitting, saturation, and focus on merely code generation. In this work, we propose LiveCodeBench, a comprehensive and contamination-free evaluation of LLMs for code, which collects new problems over time from contests across three competition platforms, Leetcode, Atcoder, and Codeforces. Notably, our benchmark also focuses on a broader range of code-related capabilities, such as self-repair, code execution, and test output prediction, beyond just code generation. Currently, LiveCodeBench hosts over six hundred coding problems that were published between May 2023 and Aug 2024.

We demonstrate that time-segmented evaluations serve as a robust approach to evade contamination; they are successful at detecting contamination across a wide range of open and closed models including GPT-4O, Claude, Deepseek, and Codestral.

It has driven advancements in AI fields, such as non-monotonic and commonsense reasoning. RAC remains crucial for AI systems that operate in dynamic environments, engage in interactive scenarios, or rely on commonsense reasoning. Despite substantial advances made by Large Language Models (LLMs) in various AI domains, their performance in RAC remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a new diagnostic benchmark, $\\textbf{ActionReasoningBench}$, which encompasses 8 domains and includes questions for up to 19 action sequences. This benchmark rigorously evaluates LLMs across six key RAC dimensions: $\\textit{Fluent Tracking}$, $\\textit{State Tracking}$, $\\textit{Action Executability}$, $\\textit{Effects of Actions}$, $\\textit{Numerical RAC}$, and $\\textit{Composite Questions}$. LLMs demonstrate average accuracy rates of 73.55%, 65.63%, 58.73%, and 62.38% on the former four dimensions, which are frequently discussed in RAC literature. However, the performance on the latter two dimensions, which introduce complex and novel reasoning questions, the average performance of LLMs is lowered to 33.16% and 51.19%, respectively, reflecting a 17.9% performance decline. We also introduce new ramification constraints to capture the indirect effects of actions, providing deeper insights into RAC challenges.

To address this issue, we propose Group Distributional Preference Optimization (GDPO), a novel framework that aligns language models with the distribution of preferences within a group by incorporating the concept of beliefs that shape individual preferences. GDPO calibrates a language model using statistical estimation of the group's belief distribution and aligns the model with belief-conditioned preferences, offering a more inclusive alignment framework than traditional methods. In experiments using both synthetic controllable opinion generation and real-world movie review datasets, we show that DPO fails to align with the targeted belief distributions, while GDPO consistently reduces this alignment gap during training.

Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely used technique to reduce latency losslessly, but the conventional wisdom suggests that its efficacy is limited to small batch sizes. In MagicDec, we show that surprisingly SD can achieve speedup even for a high throughput inference regime for moderate to long sequences. More interestingly, an intelligent drafting strategy can achieve better speedup with increasing batch size based on our rigorous analysis. MagicDec first identifies the bottleneck shifts with increasing batch size and sequence length, and uses these insights to deploy SD more effectively for high throughput inference. We leverage draft model with sparse KV cache to address the KV bottleneck, which scales with both sequence length and batch size. Additionally, we propose a theoretical model to select the optimal drafting strategy for maximum speedup. Our work highlights the broad applicability of speculative decoding in long-context serving, as it can enhance throughput and reduce latency without compromising accuracy.

This approach produces a more diverse set of samples, allowing faster mixing within the same computational budget.

Consequently, as the scale and complexity of modern applications continue to grow, the development of efficient and reliable QP algorithms becomes increasingly vital. In this context, this paper introduces a novel deep learning-aided distributed optimization architecture designed for tackling large-scale QP problems. First, we combine the state-of-the-art Operator Splitting QP (OSQP) method with a consensus approach to derive **DistributedQP**, a new method tailored for network-structured problems, with convergence guarantees to optimality. Subsequently, we unfold this optimizer into a deep learning framework, leading to **DeepDistributedQP**, which leverages learned policies to accelerate reaching to desired accuracy within a restricted amount of iterations. Our approach is also theoretically grounded through Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory, providing generalization bounds on the expected optimality gap for unseen problems. The proposed framework, as well as its centralized version **DeepQP**, significantly outperform their standard optimization counterparts on a variety of tasks such as randomly generated problems, optimal control, linear regression, transportation networks and others. Notably, DeepDistributedQP demonstrates strong generalization by training on small problems and scaling to solve much larger ones (up to 50K variables and 150K constraints) using the same policy. Moreover, it achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in wall-clock time compared to OSQP.

In particular, our framework allows us to systematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or uninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on the convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal characterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We empirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining 7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear regression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can lead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding tasks. However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Imitation learning aims at constructing an optimal policy by emulating expert demonstrations. However, the prevailing approaches in this domain typically presume that the demonstrations are optimal, an assumption that seldom holds true in the complexities of real-world applications. The data collected in practical scenarios often contains imperfections, encompassing both optimal and non-optimal examples. In this study, we propose Positive-Negative Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (PN-GAIL), a novel approach that falls within the framework of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL). PN-GAIL innovatively leverages non-optimal information from imperfect demonstrations, allowing the discriminator to comprehensively assess the positive and negative risks associated with these demonstrations. Furthermore, it requires only a small subset of labeled confidence scores. Theoretical analysis indicates that PN-GAIL deviates from the non-optimal data while mimicking imperfect demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that PN-GAIL surpasses conventional baseline methods in dealing with imperfect demonstrations, thereby significantly augmenting the practical utility of imitation learning in real-world contexts.

    "abstract": "In open-ended generative tasks like narrative writing or dialogue, large language models often exhibit cultural biases, showing limited knowledge and generating templated outputs for less prevalent cultures. Recent works show that these biases may stem from uneven cultural representation in pretraining corpora. This work investigates how pretraining leads to biased culture-conditioned generations by analyzing how models associate entities with cultures based on pretraining data patterns. We propose the MEMOED framework (MEMOrization from prEtraining Document) to determine whether a generation for a culture arises from memorization. Using MEMOED on culture-conditioned generations about food and clothing for 110 cultures, we find that high-frequency cultures in pretraining data yield more generations with memorized symbols, while some low-frequency cultures produce none. Additionally, the model favors generating entities with extraordinarily high frequency regardless of the conditioned culture, reflecting biases toward frequent pretraining terms irrespective of relevance. We hope that the MEMOED framework and our insights will inspire more works on attributing model performance on pretraining data",

Specifically, in addition to using embeddings as indexes like existing neural retrieval methods, SiDR supports a non-parametric tokenization index for search, achieving BM25-like indexing complexity with significantly better effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across 16 retrieval benchmarks demonstrates that SiDR outperforms both neural and term-based retrieval baselines under the same indexing workload: (i) When using an embedding-based index, SiDR exceeds the performance of conventional neural retrievers while maintaining similar training complexity; (ii) When using a tokenization-based index, SiDR drastically reduces indexing cost and time, matching the complexity of traditional term-based retrieval, while consistently outperforming BM25 on all in-domain datasets; (iii) Additionally, we introduce a late parametric mechanism that matches BM25 index preparation time while outperforming other neural retrieval baselines in effectiveness",

DelTA features a multi-level memory structure that stores information across various granularities and spans, including Proper Noun Records, Bilingual Summary, Long-Term Memory, and Short-Term Memory, which are continuously retrieved and updated by auxiliary LLM-based components. Experimental results indicate that DelTA significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of translation consistency and quality across four open/closed-source LLMs and two representative document translation datasets, achieving an increase in consistency scores by up to 4.58 percentage points and in COMET scores by up to 3.16 points on average. DelTA employs a sentence-by-sentence translation strategy, ensuring no sentence omissions and offering a memory-efficient solution compared to the mainstream method. Furthermore, DelTA improves pronoun and context-dependent translation accuracy, and the summary component of the agent also shows promise as a tool for query-based summarization tasks.

In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on supervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning diverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B parameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various training configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained models. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing findings that challenge several common training practices, including hyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by Orca. The code used for the experiments can be found here: https://github.com/instructlab/training. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with lower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as MMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics, such as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of better final model performance, allowing for early termination of sub-optimal runs and significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of hyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide guidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not compromise performance; and (iv) we observe no significant difference in performance between phased (sequentially training on data divided into phases) and stacked (training on the entire dataset at once) strategies, but stacked training is simpler and more sample efficient. With these findings holding robustly across datasets as well as model families and sizes, we hope this study serves as a guide for practitioners fine-tuning small LLMs and promotes a more inclusive research environment for LLM development",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become the predominant approach for aligning language models (LMs) to be more helpful and less harmful. At its core, RLHF uses a margin-based loss for preference optimization, which specifies the ideal LM behavior only in terms of the difference between preferred and dispreferred responses. In this paper, we identify a common pitfall of margin-based methods---the under-specification of ideal LM behavior on preferred and dispreferred responses individually, which results in two unintended consequences as the margin increases: (1) The probability of dispreferred (e.g., unsafe) responses may increase, resulting in potential safety alignment failures. (2) The probability of preferred responses may decrease, even when those responses are ideal. We demystify the reasons behind these problematic behaviors: margin-based losses couple the change in the preferred probability with the gradient of the dispreferred one, and vice versa, often preventing the preferred probability from increasing while the dispreferred one decreases, and thus causing a synchronized increase or decrease in both probabilities. We term this effect, inherent in margin-based objectives, gradient entanglement. Formally, we derive conditions for general margin-based alignment objectives under which gradient entanglement becomes concerning: the inner product between the gradient of preferred log-probability and the gradient of dispreferred log-probability is large relative to the individual gradient norms. Furthermore, we theoretically investigate why such inner products can be large when aligning language models and empirically validate our findings. Empirical implications of our framework further extend to explaining important differences in the training dynamics of various preference optimization algorithms and suggesting future directions for improvement",

    "abstract": "Recent alignment algorithms such as direct preference optimization (DPO) have been developed to improve the safety of large language models (LLMs) by training these models to match human behaviors exemplified by preference data. However, these methods are both computationally intensive and lacking in controllability and transparency, inhibiting their widespread use. Furthermore, these tuning-based methods require large-scale preference data for training and are susceptible to noisy preference data. In this paper, we introduce a tuning-free alignment alternative, ProFS (Projection Filter for Subspaces), and demonstrate its effectiveness under the use case of toxicity reduction. Grounded on theory from factor analysis, ProFS is a sample-efficient model editing approach that identifies a toxic subspace in the model parameter space and reduces model toxicity by projecting away the detected subspace. The toxic subspace is identified by extracting preference data embeddings from the language model, and removing non-toxic information from these embeddings. We show that ProFS is more sample-efficient than DPO, further showcasing greater robustness to noisy data. Finally, we attempt to connect tuning based alignment with editing, by establishing both theoretical and empirical connections between ProFS and DPO, showing that ProFS can be interpreted as a denoised version of a single DPO step",

To investigate this, we train models spanning various datasets, scales, image-text ratios, and amount of pre-training done before introducing vision tokens. We then fine-tune these models and evaluate their downstream performance on a suite of vision-language and text-only tasks.

Unlike humans who can reliably apply solution steps to similar problems with minor modifications, we found that state-of-the-art VLMs like GPT-4o can consistently fail in these scenarios, revealing limitations in their mathematical reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the **mathematical reasoning robustness** in VLMs and evaluate how well these models perform under different variants of the same question, such as changes in visual numerical values or function graphs. While several vision-based math benchmarks have been developed to assess VLMs' problem-solving capabilities, these benchmarks contain only static sets of problems and cannot easily evaluate mathematical reasoning robustness. To fill this gap, we introduce **DynaMath**, a dynamic visual math benchmark designed for in-depth assessment of VLMs. **DynaMath** includes 501 high-quality, multi-topic *seed* questions, *each represented as a Python program*. Those programs are carefully designed and annotated to enable the automatic generation of a much larger set of *concrete* questions, including many different types of visual and textual variations. **DynaMath** allows us to evaluate the generalization ability of VLMs, by assessing their performance under varying input conditions of a seed question. We evaluated 14 state-of-the-art VLMs with 5,010 generated concrete questions (10 per seed question). Our results show that the worst-case model accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly answered seed questions in all 10 variants, is significantly lower than the average-case accuracy. In addition, many models show high consistency in answering these questions -- the incorrectness of a certain variant of a seed question is not only due to inherent randomness. Our analysis emphasizes the need to study the robustness of VLMs' reasoning abilities, and **DynaMath** provides valuable insights to guide the development of more reliable models for mathematical reasoning",

To address these issues, we propose the Adaptive Rank Allocation framework and introduce the Rank and Neuron Allocator (RaNA) adapter. RaNA adapters leverage rank adapters, which operate on linear layers by applying both low-rank matrix decompositions and adaptive masking to efficiently allocate compute without depending on activation sparsity. This enables RaNA to be generally applied to MLPs and linear components of attention modules, while eliminating the need for expensive maskers found in neuron-adaptive methods. Notably, when compared to neuron adapters, RaNA improves perplexity by up to 7 points and increases accuracy by up to 8 percentage-points when reducing FLOPs by $\\sim$44\\% in state-of-the-art Transformer architectures.

    "title": "A Little Goes a Long Way: Efficient Long Context Training and Inference with Partial Contexts",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Training and serving long-context large language models (LLMs) incurs substantial overhead. To address this, two critical steps are often required: a pretrained LLM typically undergoes a separate stage for context length extension by training on long-context data, followed by architectural modifications to reduce the overhead of KV cache during serving. This paper argues that integrating length extension with a GPU-friendly KV cache reduction architecture not only reduces training overhead during length extension, but also achieves better long-context performance. This leads to our proposed LongGen, which finetunes a pretrained LLM into an efficient architecture during length extension. LongGen builds on three key insights: (1) Sparse attention patterns, such as window attention (attending to recent tokens), attention sink (initial ones), and blockwise sparse attention (strided token blocks) are well-suited for building efficient long-context models, primarily due to their GPU-friendly memory access patterns, enabling efficiency gains not just theoretically but in practice as well. (2) It is essential for the model to have direct access to all tokens. A hybrid architecture with 1/3 full attention layers and 2/3 efficient ones achieves a balanced trade-off between efficiency and long-context performance. (3) Lightweight training on 5B long-context data is sufficient to extend the hybrid model's context length from 4K to 128K. We evaluate LongGen on both Llama-2 7B and Llama-2 70B, demonstrating its effectiveness across different scales. During training with 128K-long contexts, LongGen achieves 1.55x training speedup and reduces wall-clock time by 36%, compared to a full-attention baseline. During inference, LongGen reduces KV cache memory by 62%, achieving 1.67x prefilling speedup and 1.41x decoding speedup. Compared to baselines that apply KV-cache reduction techniques to full-attention long-context LLMs, LongGen achieves substantially stronger performance not only on the Needle-in-a-Haystack retrieval task, but also on more challenging long-context reasoning tasks, including BABILong and RULER",

Building on the theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we characterize the local geometry in terms of three geometric descriptors - scaling ($\\psi$), rank ($\\nu$), and complexity/un-smoothness ($\\delta$). We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent vector, the local descriptors are indicative of post-generation aesthetics, generation diversity, and memorization by the generative model. Finally, we demonstrate that by training a reward model on the 'local scaling' for Stable Diffusion, we can self-improve both generation aesthetics and diversity using geometry sensitive guidance during denoising.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The currently leading artificial neural network models of the visual ventral stream - which are derived from a combination of performance optimization and robustification methods - have demonstrated a remarkable degree of behavioral alignment with humans on visual categorization tasks. We show that image perturbations generated by these models can enhance the ability of humans to accurately report the ground truth class. Furthermore, we find that the same models can also be used out-of-the-box to predict the proportion of correct human responses to individual images, providing a simple, human-aligned estimator of the relative difficulty of each image. Motivated by these observations, we propose to augment visual learning in humans in a way that improves human categorization accuracy at test time. Our learning augmentation approach consists of (i) selecting images based on their model-estimated recognition difficulty, and (ii) applying image perturbations that aid recognition for novice learners. We find that combining these model-based strategies leads to categorization accuracy gains of 33-72% relative to control subjects without these interventions, on unmodified, randomly selected held-out test images. Beyond the accuracy gain, the training time for the augmented learning group was also shortened by 20-23%, despite both groups completing the same number of training trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a fine-grained categorization task with natural images, as well as two tasks in clinically relevant image domains - histology and dermoscopy - where visual learning is notoriously challenging. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application of artificial neural networks to increase visual learning performance in humans by enhancing category-specific image features",

Despite the growing interest in using deep learning models for BEV semantic segmentation, anticipating segmentation errors and enhancing the explainability of these models remain underexplored. This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark for predictive uncertainty quantification in BEV segmentation, evaluating multiple uncertainty quantification methods across three popular datasets with three representative network architectures. Our study focuses on the effectiveness of quantified uncertainty in detecting misclassified and out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels while also improving model calibration. Through empirical analysis, we uncover challenges in existing uncertainty quantification methods and demonstrate the potential of evidential deep learning techniques, which capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose a novel loss function, Uncertainty-Focal-Cross-Entropy (UFCE), specifically designed for highly imbalanced data, along with a simple uncertainty-scaling regularization term that improves both uncertainty quantification and model calibration for BEV segmentation",

The benchmark is designed to systematically assess current model capabilities in discovery tasks and provide a useful resource for improving them. Our benchmark contains 264 tasks collected across 6 diverse domains, such as sociology and engineering, by manually deriving discovery workflows from published papers to approximate the real-world challenges faced by researchers, where each task is defined by a dataset, its metadata, and a discovery goal in natural language. We additionally provide 903 synthetic tasks to conduct controlled evaluations on data-driven workflows that are not covered in the manually collected split. Furthermore, our structured formalism of data-driven discovery enables a facet-based evaluation that provides useful insights into different failure modes. We evaluate several popular LLM-based reasoning frameworks using both open and closed LLMs as baselines on DiscoveryBench and find that even the best system scores only 25%.

To explore this question, we develop generalization bounds on the pretraining objective of large language models (LLMs) in the compute-optimal regime, as described by the Chinchilla scaling laws. We introduce a novel, fully empirical Freedman-type martingale concentration inequality that tightens existing bounds by accounting for the variance of the loss function. The generalization bound can be broken into three contributions: the number of parameters per token, the loss variance, and the quantization error at a fixed bitrate. As language models are scaled up, the number of parameters per data point stays constant; however, both the loss variance and the quantization error decrease, implying that larger models should have \\emph{smaller} generalization gaps. We examine why larger models tend to be more quantizable from an information theoretic perspective, showing that the rate at which they can integrate new information grows slower than their capacity on the compute optimal frontier. From these findings we produce a scaling law for the generalization gap, showing that our bounds decrease in a predictable way",

We develop a novel offline model-based RL approach that particularly shines in low-quality data regimes while maintaining competitive performance on high-quality datasets. Neural Stochastic Differential Equations for Uncertainty-aware, Offline RL (NUNO) learns a dynamics model as neural stochastic differential equations (SDE), where its drift term can leverage prior physics knowledge as inductive bias. In parallel, its diffusion term provides distance-aware estimates of model uncertainty by matching the dynamics' underlying stochasticity near the training data regime while providing high but bounded estimates beyond it. To address the so-called model exploitation problem in offline model-based RL, NUNO builds on existing studies by penalizing and adaptively truncating neural SDE's rollouts according to uncertainty estimates. Our empirical results in D4RL and NeoRL MuJoCo benchmarks evidence that NUNO outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-quality datasets by up to 93% while matching or surpassing their performance by up to 55% in some high-quality counterparts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an indispensable part of natural language processing tasks. However, autoregressive sampling has become an efficiency bottleneck. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) is a recent approach where, when generating each token, a small draft model generates multiple drafts, and the target LLM verifies them in parallel, ensuring that the final output conforms to the target model distribution. The two main design choices in MDSD are the draft sampling method and the verification algorithm. For a fixed draft sampling method, the optimal acceptance rate is a solution to an optimal transport problem, but the complexity of this problem makes it difficult to solve for the optimal acceptance rate and measure the gap between existing verification algorithms and the theoretical upper bound. This paper discusses the dual of the optimal transport problem, providing a way to efficiently compute the optimal acceptance rate. For the first time, we measure the theoretical upper bound of MDSD efficiency for vocabulary sizes in the thousands and quantify the gap between existing verification algorithms and this bound. We also compare different draft sampling methods based on their optimal acceptance rates. Our results show that the draft sampling method strongly influences the optimal acceptance rate, with sampling without replacement outperforming sampling with replacement. Additionally, existing verification algorithms do not reach the theoretical upper bound for both without replacement and with replacement sampling. Our findings suggest that carefully designed draft sampling methods can potentially improve the optimal acceptance rate and enable the development of verification algorithms that closely match the theoretical upper bound",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have been effective in learning data priors for solving inverse problems. They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance. Finally, we demonstrate that DiffStateGrad improves upon the state-of-the-art on linear and nonlinear image restoration inverse problems.

MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN's performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever.

However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a \"temporal recall\" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning",

Recent advancements in hardware have significantly reduced matrix multiplication times, making neural network simulation both fast and efficient. Consequently, functions defined by complex Boolean networks are increasingly viable candidates for simulation through their neural network representation. Prior research has introduced a general method for deriving neural network representations of Boolean networks. However, the resulting neural networks are often suboptimal in terms of the number of neurons and connections, leading to slower simulation performance. Optimizing them while preserving functional equivalence --lossless optimization-- is an NP-hard problem, and current methods only provide lossy solutions. In this paper, we present a deterministic algorithm to optimize such neural networks in terms of neurons and connections while preserving functional equivalence. Moreover, to accelerate the compression of the neural network, we introduce an objective-aware algorithm that exploits representations that are shared among subproblems of the overall optimization. We demonstrate experimentally that we are able to reduce connections and neurons by up to 70% and 60%, respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art. We also find that our objective-aware algorithm results in consistent speedups in optimization time, achieving up to 34.3x and 5.9x speedup relative to naive and caching solutions, respectively.

    "title": "Causal Order: The Key to Leveraging Imperfect Experts in Causal Inference",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been used as experts to infer causal graphs, often by repeatedly applying a pairwise prompt that asks about the causal relationship of each variable pair. However, such experts, including human domain experts, cannot distinguish between direct and indirect effects given a pairwise prompt. Therefore, instead of the graph, we propose that causal order be used as a more stable output interface for utilizing expert knowledge. When querying a perfect expert with a pairwise prompt, we show that the inferred graph can have significant errors whereas the causal order is always correct. In practice, however, LLMs are imperfect experts and we find that pairwise prompts lead to multiple cycles and do not yield a valid order. Hence, we propose a prompting strategy that introduces an auxiliary variable for every variable pair and instructs the LLM to avoid cycles within this triplet. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that such a triplet prompt leads to fewer cycles than the pairwise prompt. Across multiple real-world graphs, the triplet prompt yields a more accurate order using both LLMs and human annotators as experts. By querying the expert with different auxiliary variables for the same variable pair, it also increases robustness---triplet method with much smaller models such as Phi-3 and Llama-3 8B outperforms a pairwise prompt with GPT-4. For practical usage, we show how the estimated causal order from the triplet method can be used to reduce error in downstream discovery and effect inference tasks",

    "abstract": "Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving reasoning tasks; however, even the strongest models still occasionally make reasoning mistakes. Recently, there has been active research aimed at improving reasoning accuracy, particularly by using pretrained language models to \"self-correct'' their mistakes via multi-round prompting. In this paper, we follow this line of work but focus on understanding the usefulness of incorporating ``error-correction'' data directly into the pretraining stage. This data consists of erroneous solution steps immediately followed by their corrections. Using a synthetic math dataset, we show promising results: this type of pretrain data can help language models achieve higher reasoning accuracy directly (i.e., through simple auto-regression, without multi-round prompting) compared to pretraining on the same amount of error-free data. We also delve into many details, such as (1) how this approach differs from beam search, (2) how such data can be prepared, (3) whether masking is needed on the erroneous tokens, (4) the amount of error required, (5) whether such data can be deferred to the fine-tuning stage, and many others",

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in processing and reasoning over knowledge graphs, current methods suffer from a high non-retrieval rate. This limitation reduces the accuracy of answering questions based on these graphs. Our analysis reveals that the combination of greedy search and forward reasoning is a major contributor to this issue. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the concept of super-relations, which enables both forward and backward reasoning by summarizing and connecting various relational paths within the graph. This holistic approach not only expands the search space, but also significantly improves retrieval efficiency. In this paper, we propose the ReKnoS framework, which aims to Reason over Knowledge Graphs with Super-Relations. Our framework's key advantages include the inclusion of multiple relation paths through super-relations, enhanced forward and backward reasoning capabilities, and increased efficiency in querying LLMs. These enhancements collectively lead to a substantial improvement in the successful retrieval rate and overall reasoning performance. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of datasets to evaluate ReKnoS, and the results demonstrate the superior performance of ReKnoS over existing state-of-the-art baselines, with an average accuracy gain of 2.92% across nine real-world datasets",

    "abstract": "Through the collaboration of multiple LLM-empowered agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries. These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Foundation Models (FMs) trained on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on numerous clinical prediction tasks. However, prior EHR FMs typically have context windows of $<$1k tokens, which prevents them from modeling full patient EHRs which can exceed 10k's of events. For making clinical predictions, both model performance and robustness to the unique properties of EHR data are crucial. Recent advancements in subquadratic long-context architectures (e.g. Mamba) offer a promising solution. However, their application to EHR data has not been well-studied. We address this gap by presenting the first systematic evaluation of the effect of context length on modeling EHR data. We find that longer context models improve predictive performance -- our Mamba-based model surpasses the prior state-of-the-art on 9/14 tasks on the EHRSHOT prediction benchmark. Additionally, we measure robustness to three unique, previously underexplored properties of EHR data: (1) the prevalence of ``copy-forwarded\" diagnoses which create artificial token repetition in EHR sequences; (2) the irregular time intervals between EHR events which can lead to a wide range of timespans within a context window; and (3) the natural increase in disease complexity over time which makes later tokens in the EHR harder to predict than earlier ones. Stratifying our EHRSHOT results, we find that higher levels of each property correlate negatively with model performance (e.g., a 14% higher Brier loss between the least and most irregular patients), but that longer context models are more robust to more extreme levels of these properties. Our work highlights the potential for using long-context architectures to model EHR data, and offers a case study on how to identify and quantify new challenges in modeling sequential data motivated by domains outside of natural language.

In this paper, we identify underlying principles that lead to plastic algorithms. We provide theoretical results showing that linear function approximation, as well as a special case of deep linear networks, do not suffer from loss of plasticity. We then propose deep Fourier features, which are the concatenation of a sine and cosine in every layer, and we show that this combination provides a dynamic balance between the trainability obtained through linearity and the effectiveness obtained through the nonlinearity of neural networks. Deep networks composed entirely of deep Fourier features are highly trainable and sustain their trainability over the course of learning. Our empirical results show that continual learning performance can be improved by replacing ReLU activations with deep Fourier features combined with regularization.

In this paper, we introduce STAFF, a speculative coreset selection method. STAFF leverages a small model from the same family as the target LLM to efficiently estimate data scores and then verifies the scores on the target LLM to accurately identify and allocate more selection budget to important regions while maintaining coverage of easy regions. We evaluate STAFF on three LLMs and three downstream tasks and show that STAFF improves the performance of SOTA methods by up to 54.3% and reduces selection overhead by up to 70.5% at different pruning rates.

    "abstract": "With the rise of medical foundation models and the growing availability of imaging data, scalable pretraining techniques offer a promising way to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of future disease risk. While current self-supervised methods for 3D medical imaging models capture local structural features like organ morphology, they fail to link pixel biomarkers with long-term health outcomes due to a missing context problem. Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing diagnostic classification performance.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents have demonstrated significant potential in automating complex multistep decision-making tasks. However, even state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs), such as GPT-4o, still fall short of human-level performance, particularly in intricate web environments and long-horizon planning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce Reflective Monte Carlo Tree Search (R-MCTS), a novel test-time algorithm designed to enhance the ability of AI agents, e.g., powered by GPT-4o, to explore decision space on the fly. R-MCTS extends traditional MCTS by 1) incorporating contrastive reflection, allowing agents to learn from past interactions and dynamically improve their search efficiency; and 2) using multi-agent debate to provide reliable state evaluation. Moreover, we improve the agent's performance by fine-tuning GPT-4o through self-learning, using R-MCTS generated tree traversals without any human-provided labels. On the challenging VisualWebArena benchmark, our GPT-4o-based R-MCTS agent achieves a 6% to 30% relative improvement across various tasks compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Additionally, we show that the knowledge gained from test-time search can be effectively transferred back to GPT-4o via fine-tuning. The fine-tuned GPT-4o matches 97\\% of R-MCTS's performance while reducing compute usage by a factor of four at test time. Furthermore, qualitative results reveal that the fine-tuned GPT-4o model demonstrates the ability to explore the environment, evaluate a state, and backtrack to viable ones when it detects that the current state cannot lead to success. Moreover, our work demonstrates the compute scaling properties in both training - data collection with R-MCTS - and testing time. These results suggest a promising research direction to enhance VLMs' reasoning and planning capabilities for agentic applications via test-time search and self-learning",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Information retrieval (IR) systems have played a vital role in modern digital life and have cemented their continued usefulness in this new era of generative AI via retrieval-augmented generation. With strong language processing capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far, LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full potential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient re-ranking. We assume that more relevant documents should receive more attention weights when an LLM is processing the query tokens, and leverage such signals for re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking. Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks that require more complex re-ranking signals, such as handling contextualization and contradiction between the query and passages, as well as information integration across multiple passages. Our findings call for further exploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation",

First, we find that the Llama3-8b–Instruct chat model - but not the base Llama3-8b model - can reliably distinguish its own outputs from those of humans, and present evidence that the chat model is likely using its experience with its own outputs, acquired during post-training, to succeed at the writing recognition task. Second, we identify a vector in the residual stream of the model that is differentially activated when the model makes a correct self-written-text recognition judgment, show that the vector activates in response to information relevant to self-authorship, present evidence that the vector is related to the concept of ``self'' in the model, and demonstrate that the vector is causally related to the model's ability to perceive and assert self-authorship. Finally, we show that the vector can be used to control both the model's behavior and its perception, steering the model to claim or disclaim authorship by applying the vector to the model's output as it generates it, and steering the model to believe or disbelieve it wrote arbitrary texts by applying the vector to them as the model reads them",

Our goal is to inherit two properties of standard algorithms from numerical analysis: (1) machine precision, i.e. we want to obtain solutions that are accurate to near floating point error, and (2) numerical generality, i.e. we want them to apply broadly across problem instances. We find that prior approaches using Transformers fail to meet these criteria, and identify limitations present in existing architectures and training procedures. First, we show that softmax Transformers struggle to perform high-precision multiplications, which prevents them from precisely learning numerical algorithms. Second, we identify an alternate class of architectures, comprised entirely of polynomials, that can efficiently represent high-precision gradient descent iterates. Finally, we investigate precision bottlenecks during training and address them via a high-precision training recipe that reduces stochastic gradient noise. Our recipe enables us to train two polynomial architectures, gated convolutions and linear attention, to perform gradient descent iterates on least squares problems. For the first time, we demonstrate the ability to train to near machine precision. Applied iteratively, our models obtain $100,000\\times$ lower MSE than standard Transformers trained end-to-end and they incur a $10,000\\times$ smaller generalization gap on out-of-distribution problems.

    "abstract": "Positional encodings (PEs) are essential for effective graph representation learning because they provide position awareness in inherently position-agnostic transformer architectures and increase the expressive capacity of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, designing powerful and efficient PEs for graphs poses significant challenges due to the absence of canonical node ordering and the scale of the graph. In this work, we identify four key properties that graph PEs should satisfy: stability, expressive power, scalability, and genericness. We find that existing eigenvector-based PE methods often fall short of jointly satisfying these criteria. To address this gap, we introduce PEARL, a novel framework of learnable PEs for graphs. Our primary insight is that message-passing GNNs function as nonlinear mappings of eigenvectors, enabling the design of GNN architectures for generating powerful and efficient PEs. A crucial challenge lies in initializing node features in a manner that is both expressive and permutation equivariant. We tackle this by initializing GNNs with random node inputs or standard basis vectors, thereby unlocking the expressive power of message-passing operations, while employing statistical pooling functions to maintain permutation equivariance. Our analysis demonstrates that PEARL approximates equivariant functions of eigenvectors with linear complexity, while rigorously establishing its stability and high expressive power. Experimental evaluations show that PEARL outperforms lightweight versions of eigenvector-based PEs and achieves comparable performance to full eigenvector-based PEs, but with one or two orders of magnitude lower complexity.

While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available",

However, it has been challenging to date to apply these methods to the full scale of LLM pretraining. In this paper, we refine existing gradient-based methods to work effectively at scale, allowing us to retrieve influential examples for an 8B-parameter language model from a pretraining corpus of over 160B tokens with no need for subsampling or pre-filtering. Our method combines several techniques, including optimizer state correction, a task-specific Hessian approximation, and normalized encodings, which we find to be critical for performance at scale. In quantitative evaluations on a fact tracing task, our method performs best at identifying examples that influence model predictions, but classical, model-agnostic retrieval methods such as BM25 still perform better at finding passages which explicitly contain relevant facts. These results demonstrate a misalignment between factual *attribution* and causal *influence*. With increasing model size and training tokens, we find that influence more closely aligns with factual attribution. Finally, we examine different types of examples identified as influential by our method, finding that while many directly entail a particular fact, others support the same output by reinforcing priors on relation types, common entities, and names. We release our prompt set and model outputs, along with a web-based visualization tool to explore influential examples for factual predictions, commonsense reasoning, arithmetic, and open-ended generation for an 8B-parameter LLM",

While existing methods for protecting images from manipulation in diffusion-based generative models have primarily focused on image-to-image and text-to-image tasks, the challenge of preventing unauthorized inpainting has been rarely addressed, often resulting in suboptimal protection performance. To mitigate inpainting abuses, we propose ADVPAINT, a novel defensive framework that generates adversarial perturbations that effectively disrupt the adversary's inpainting tasks. ADVPAINT targets the self- and cross-attention blocks in a target diffusion inpainting model to distract semantic understanding and prompt interactions during image generation. ADVPAINT also employs a two-stage perturbation strategy, dividing the perturbation region based on an enlarged bounding box around the object, enhancing robustness across diverse masks of varying shapes and sizes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADVPAINT's perturbations are highly effective in disrupting the adversary's inpainting tasks, outperforming existing methods; ADVPAINT attains over a 100-point increase in FID and substantial decreases in precision",

    "title": "Mastering Task Arithmetic: τ Jp as a Key Indicator for Weight Disentanglement",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Model-editing techniques using task arithmetic have rapidly gained attention. Through task arithmetic, simply through arithmetic operations on the weights of pre-trained and fine-tuned models create desired models, such as multi-task models, models in which specific tasks are unsolvable, or domain-transferred models. However, task arithmetic faces challenges, such as poor reproducibility and the high cost associated with adjusting coefficients in the arithmetic operations on model parameters, which have limited its practical success. In this paper, we present three key contributions in the context of task addition and task negation within task arithmetic. First, we propose a new metric called $\\tau$Jp which is based on the product of the task vector ($\\tau$) and the Jacobian of the pre-trained model with respect to its weights. We show that $\\tau$Jp has a causal relationship with the interference that occurs from arithmetic operations. Second, we show that introducing regularization to minimize $\\tau$Jp significantly mitigates interference between task inference, which leads to the elimination of coefficient tuning and improved accuracy on each task. Third, in the context of incremental learning, we demonstrate that our $\\tau$Jp regularization achieves more robust performance in environments where access to future tasks is unavailable, thus validating the scalability of the approach. Finally, we demonstrate that the $\\tau$Jp regularizer further reinforces the performance of task arithmetic by leveraging publicly available fine-tuned models, offering practical benefits for real-world applications.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generative AI has transformed the fields of Design and Manufacturing by providing efficient and automated methods for generating and modifying 3D objects. One approach involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Computer- Aided Design (CAD) scripting code, which can then be executed to render a 3D object; however, the resulting 3D object may not meet the specified requirements. Testing the correctness of CAD generated code is challenging due to the complexity and structure of 3D objects (e.g., shapes, surfaces, and dimensions) that are not feasible in code. In this paper, we introduce CADCodeVerify, a novel approach to iteratively verify and improve 3D objects generated from CAD code. Our approach works by producing ameliorative feedback by prompting a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate and answer a set of validation questions to verify the generated object and prompt the VLM to correct deviations. To evaluate CADCodeVerify, we introduce, CADPrompt, the first benchmark for CAD code generation, consisting of 200 natural language prompts paired with expert-annotated scripting code for 3D objects to benchmark progress. Our findings show that CADCodeVerify improves VLM performance by providing visual feedback, enhancing the structure of the 3D objects, and increasing the success rate of the compiled program. When applied to GPT-4, CADCodeVerify achieved a 7.30% reduction in Point Cloud distance and a 5.0% improvement in success rate compared to prior work",

While previous works have empirically shown that transformers can either succeed or fail at length generalization depending on the task, theoretical understanding of this phenomenon remains limited.

In particular, we characterize those functions that are identifiable in the limit from sufficiently long inputs with absolute positional encodings under an idealized inference scheme using a norm-based regularizer. This enables us to prove the possibility of length generalization for a rich family of problems. We experimentally validate the theory as a predictor of success and failure of length generalization across a range of algorithmic and formal language tasks.

In this paper, we introduce our lightweight, all-in-one automated benchmarking framework that allows users to evaluate LLMs on mobile devices. We provide a comprehensive benchmark of various popular LLMs with different quantization configurations (both weights and activations) across multiple mobile platforms with varying hardware capabilities. Unlike traditional benchmarks that assess full-scale models on high-end GPU clusters, we focus on evaluating resource efficiency (memory and power consumption) and harmful output for compressed models on mobile devices. Our key observations include: i) differences in energy efficiency and throughput across mobile platforms; ii) the impact of quantization on memory usage, GPU execution time, and power consumption; and iii) accuracy and performance degradation of quantized models compared to their non-quantized counterparts; and iv) the frequency of hallucinations and toxic content generated by compressed LLMs on mobile devices",

The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards across $T$ rounds under the knapsack constraints with an initial budget of $B$. We study CBwK in the small budget regime where the budget $B = \\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ and propose an Adaptive and Universal Primal--Dual algorithm (AUPD) that achieves strong regret performance: i) AUPD achieves $\\tilde{O}((1 + \\frac{\\nu^*}{\\delta b})\\sqrt{T})$ regret under the strict feasibility assumption without any prior information, matching the best-known bounds; ii) AUPD achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T}+ \\frac{\\nu^*}{\\sqrt{b}}T^{\\frac{3}{4}})$ regret without strict feasibility assumption, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first result in the literature. Here, the parameter $\\nu^*$ represents the optimal average reward; $b=B/T$ is the average budget and $\\delta b$ is the feasibility/safety margin. We establish these strong results through the adaptive budget-aware design, which effectively balances reward maximization and budget consumption. We provide a new perspective on analyzing budget consumption using the Lyapunov drift method, along with a refined analysis of its cumulative variance.

However, despite its promise, it is unclear what aspects dominate the benefits and whether simply scaling to more examples is the most effective way of improving many-shot ICL. In this work, we first provide an analysis on the factors driving many-shot ICL, and we find that 1) many-shot performance can still be attributed to often a few disproportionately influential examples and 2) identifying such influential examples (\"optimize\") and using them as demonstrations to regenerate new examples (\"generate\") can lead to further improvements. Inspired by the findings, we propose BRIDGE, an algorithm that alternates between the optimize step with Bayesian optimization to discover the influential sets of examples and the generate step to reuse this set to expand the reasoning paths of the examples back to the many-shot regime automatically. On Gemini, Claude, and Mistral LLMs of different sizes, we show BRIDGE led to significant improvements across a diverse set of tasks including symbolic reasoning, numerical reasoning and code generation",

While Transformers do not have an explicit recurrent form, we show that a forget gate can be naturally incorporated into Transformers by down-weighting the unnormalized attention scores in a data-dependent way. We name this attention mechanism Forgetting Attention and the resulting model the Forgetting Transformer (FoX). We show that FoX outperforms the Transformer on long-context language modeling, length extrapolation, and short-context downstream tasks, while performing on par with the Transformer on long-context downstream tasks. Moreover, it is compatible with the FlashAttention algorithm and does not require any positional embeddings. Several analyses, including the needle-in-the-haystack test, show that FoX also retains the Transformer's superior long-context capabilities over recurrent sequence models such as Mamba-2, HGRN2, and DeltaNet. We also introduce a \"Pro\" block design that incorporates some common architectural components in recurrent sequence models and find it significantly improves the performance of both FoX and the Transformer.

Most common RL algorithms use undirected exploration, i.e., select random sequences of actions. Exploration can also be directed using intrinsic rewards, such as curiosity or model epistemic uncertainty. However, effectively balancing task and intrinsic rewards is challenging and often task-dependent. In this work, we introduce a framework, MaxInfoRL, for balancing intrinsic and extrinsic exploration. MaxInfoRL steers exploration towards informative transitions, by maximizing intrinsic rewards such as the information gain about the underlying task. When combined with Boltzmann exploration, this approach naturally trades off maximization of the value function with that of the entropy over states, rewards, and actions. We show that our approach achieves sublinear regret in the simplified setting of multi-armed bandits. We then apply this general formulation to a variety of off-policy model-free RL methods for continuous state-action spaces, yielding novel algorithms that achieve superior performance across hard exploration problems and complex scenarios such as visual control tasks",

To circumvent the inverse, we construct a sequence of low-dimensional approximate Krylov subspaces with the aid of the Lanczos process. As a result, the constructed subspace is able to dynamically and incrementally approximate the Hessian inverse vector product with less effort and thus leads to a favorable estimate of the hyper-gradient. Moreover, we propose a provable subspace-based framework for bilevel problems where one central step is to solve a small-size tridiagonal linear system.

We do so by first analyzing a simplified model that uses a gating mechanism to choose between an in-weight and an in-context predictor. Through a combination of a generalization error and regret analysis we identify conditions where in-context and in-weight learning emerge. These theoretical findings are then corroborated experimentally by comparing the behaviour of a full transformer on the simplified distributions to that of the stylized model, demonstrating aligned results.

Noise contamination, especially in accelerated and/or low-field acquisitions, can significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic accuracy. Supervised learning based denoising approaches have achieved impressive performance but require high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) labels, which are often unavailable. Self-supervised learning holds promise to address the label scarcity issue, but existing self-supervised denoising methods tend to oversmooth fine spatial features and often yield inferior performance than supervised methods. We introduce Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework for MRI denoising. At the core of C2S is a generalized denoising score matching (GDSM) loss, which extends denoising score matching to work directly with noisy observations by modeling the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given further corrupted observations. This allows the model to effectively learn denoising across multiple noise levels directly from noisy data. Additionally, we incorporate a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize training and enhance convergence, and introduce a detail refinement extension to balance noise reduction with the preservation of fine spatial features. Moreover, C2S can be extended to multi-contrast denoising by leveraging complementary information across different MRI contrasts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised methods and competitive results compared to supervised counterparts across varying noise conditions and MRI contrasts on the M4Raw and fastMRI dataset.

While performance on the widely popular GSM8K benchmark has improved, questions remain about whether reported evaluation metrics are reliable, and reasoning abilities of LLMs have advanced. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data. When we add a single clause that appears relevant to the question, we observe significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the added clause does not contribute to the reasoning chain needed to reach the final answer.

In addition to their common usage in regression tasks, GP kernel parameters are frequently interpreted in various applications. For example, in spatial transcriptomics, estimated kernel parameters are used to identify spatial variable genes, which exhibit significant expression patterns across different tissue locations. However, before these parameters can be meaningfully interpreted, it is essential to establish their identifiability. Existing studies of GP parameter identifiability have focused primarily on Mat\\'ern-type kernels, as their spectral densities allow for more established mathematical tools. In many real-world applications, particuarly in time series analysis, other kernels such as the squared exponential, periodic, and rational quadratic kernels, as well as their combinations, are also widely used. These kernels share the property of being holomorphic around zero, and their parameter identifiability remains underexplored.

The semantic control adapter and the spatial control network are specifically trained to control the denoising process towards ensuring image quality and enhancing consistency between the cleaned image and the original watermarked image. To achieve a smooth trade-off between watermark removal performance and image consistency, we further propose an adjustable and controllable regeneration scheme. This scheme adds varying numbers of noise steps to the latent representation of the watermarked image, followed by a controlled denoising process starting from this noisy latent representation. As the number of noise steps increases, the latent representation progressively approaches clean Gaussian noise, facilitating the desired trade-off. We apply our watermark removal methods across various watermarking techniques, and the results demonstrate that our methods offer superior visual consistency/quality and enhanced watermark removal performance compared to existing regeneration approaches.

    "title": "Point Cluster: A Compact Message Unit for Communication-Efficient Collaborative Perception",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The objective of the collaborative perception task is to enhance the individual agent's perception capability through message communication among neighboring agents. A central challenge lies in optimizing the inherent trade-off between perception ability and communication cost. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we argue that a good message unit should encapsulate both semantic and structural information in a sparse format, a feature not present in prior approaches. In this paper, we innovatively propose a compact message unit, namely point cluster, whose core idea is to represent potential objects efficiently with explicitly decoupled low-level structure information and high-level semantic information. Building upon this new message unit, we propose a comprehensive framework CPPC for communication-efficient collaborative perception. The core principle of CPPC is twofold: first, through strategical point sampling, structure information can be well preserved with a few key points, which can significantly reduce communication cost; second, the sequence format of point clusters enables efficient message aggregation by set matching and merging, thereby eliminating unnecessary computation generated when aligning squared BEV maps, especially for long-range collaboration. To handle time latency and pose errors encountered in real-world scenarios, we also carefully design parameter-free solutions that can adapt to different noisy levels without finetuning. Experiments on two widely recognized collaborative perception benchmarks showcase the superior performance of our method compared to the previous state-of-the-art approaches",

    "title": "A Theoretical Analysis of Self-Supervised Learning for Vision Transformers",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has become a cornerstone in computer vision, primarily divided into reconstruction-based methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) and discriminative methods such as contrastive learning (CL). Recent empirical observations reveal that MAE and CL capture different types of representations: CL tends to focus on global patterns, while MAE adeptly captures **both global and subtle local** information simultaneously. Despite a flurry of recent empirical investigations to shed light on this difference, theoretical understanding remains limited, especially on the dominant architecture **vision transformers** (ViTs). In this paper, to provide rigorous insights, we model the visual data distribution by considering two types of spatial features: dominant global features and comparatively minuscule local features, and study the impact of imbalance among these features. We analyze the training dynamics of one-layer softmax-based ViTs on both MAE and CL objectives using gradient descent. Our analysis shows that as the degree of feature imbalance varies, ViTs trained with the MAE objective effectively learn both global and local features to achieve near-optimal reconstruction, while the CL-trained ViTs favor predominantly global features, even under mild imbalance. These results provide a theoretical explanation for distinct behaviors of MAE and CL observed in empirical studies",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein foundation models, significantly improving performance in protein prediction and generative tasks ranging from 3D structure prediction and protein design to conformational dynamics. However, the capabilities and limitations associated with these models remain poorly understood due to the absence of a unified evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we introduce ProteinBench, a holistic evaluation framework designed to enhance the transparency of protein foundation models. Our approach consists of three key components: (i) A taxonomic classification of tasks that broadly encompass the main challenges in the protein domain, based on the relationships between different protein modalities; (ii) A multi-metric evaluation approach that assesses performance across four key dimensions: quality, novelty, diversity, and robustness; and (iii) In-depth analyses from various user objectives, providing a holistic view of model performance. Our comprehensive evaluation of protein foundation models reveals several key findings that shed light on their current capabilities and limitations. To promote transparency and facilitate further research, we release the evaluation dataset, code, and a public leaderboard publicly for further analysis and a general modular toolkit. We intend for ProteinBench to be a living benchmark for establishing a standardized, in-depth evaluation framework for protein foundation models, driving their development and application while fostering collaboration within the field",

    "title": "LeanQuant: Accurate and Scalable Large Language Model Quantization with Loss-error-aware Grid",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown immense potential across various domains, but their high memory requirements and inference costs remain critical challenges for deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a promising technique to reduce memory requirements and decoding latency. However, recent accurate quantization methods often depend on specialized computations or custom data formats to achieve better model quality, which limits their compatibility with popular frameworks, as they require dedicated inference kernels tailored to specific hardware and software platforms, hindering wider adoption. Furthermore, many competitive methods have high resource requirements and computational overhead for quantizing models, making it challenging to scale them to hundreds of billions of parameters. In response to these challenges, we propose LeanQuant (Loss-error-aware network Quantization), a novel quantization method that is accurate, versatile, and scalable. In the existing popular iterative loss-error-based quantization framework, we identify a critical limitation in prior methods: the min-max affine quantization grid fails to preserve model quality due to outliers in inverse Hessian diagonals. To overcome this fundamental issue, we propose learning loss-error-aware grids, instead of using non-adaptive min-max affine grids. Our approach not only produces quantized models that are more accurate but also generalizes to a wider range of quantization types, including affine and non-uniform quantization, enhancing compatibility with more frameworks. Extensive experiments with recent LLMs demonstrate that LeanQuant is highly accurate, comparing favorably against competitive baselines in model quality, and scalable, achieving very accurate quantization of Llama-3.1 405B, one of the largest open-source LLMs to date, using two Quadro RTX 8000-48GB GPUs in 21 hours.

    "abstract": "The performance emergence of large language models (LLMs) driven by data scaling laws makes the selection of pre-training data increasingly important. However, existing methods rely on limited heuristics and human intuition, lacking comprehensive and clear guidelines. To address this, we are inspired by *``reverse thinking''* -- prompting LLMs to self-identify which criteria benefit its performance. As its pre-training capabilities are related to perplexity (PPL), we derive 14 quality criteria from the causes of text perplexity anomalies and introduce 15 common application domains to support domain mixing. In this paper, we train a **Data** **Man**ager (**DataMan**) to learn quality ratings and domain recognition from pointwise rating, and use it to annotate a 447B token pre-training corpus with 14 quality ratings and domain type. Our experiments validate our approach, using DataMan to select 30B tokens to train a 1.3B-parameter language model, demonstrating significant improvements in in-context learning (ICL), perplexity, and instruction-following ability over the state-of-the-art baseline. The best-performing model, based on the *Overall Score l=5* surpasses a model trained with 50% more data using uniform sampling. We continue pre-training with high-rated, domain-specific data annotated by DataMan to enhance domain-specific ICL performance and thus verify DataMan's domain mixing ability. Our findings emphasize the importance of quality ranking, the complementary nature of quality criteria, and their low correlation with perplexity, analyzing misalignment between PPL and ICL performance. We also thoroughly analyzed our pre-training dataset, examining its composition, the distribution of quality ratings, and the original document sources",

However, recent approaches to language-guided 3D scene editing either require manual interventions or focus only on appearance modifications without supporting comprehensive scene layout changes. In response, we propose EditRoom, a unified framework capable of executing a variety of layout edits through natural language commands, without requiring manual intervention. Specifically, EditRoom leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for command planning and generates target scenes using a diffusion-based method, enabling six types of edits: rotate, translate, scale, replace, add, and remove. To address the lack of data for language-guided 3D scene editing, we have developed an automatic pipeline to augment existing 3D scene synthesis datasets and introduced EditRoom-DB, a large-scale dataset with 83k editing pairs, for training and evaluation. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines across all metrics, indicating higher accuracy and coherence in language-guided scene layout editing",

    "abstract": "Understanding human locomotion is crucial for AI agents such as robots, particularly in complex indoor home environments. Modeling human trajectories in these spaces requires insight into how individuals maneuver around physical obstacles and manage social navigation dynamics. These dynamics include subtle behaviors influenced by proxemics - the social use of space, such as stepping aside to allow others to pass or choosing longer routes to avoid collisions. Previous research has developed datasets of human motion in indoor scenes, but these are often limited in scale and lack the nuanced social navigation dynamics common in home environments. To address this, we present LocoVR, a dataset of 7000+ two-person trajectories captured in virtual reality from over 130 different indoor home environments. LocoVR provides accurate trajectory and precise spatial information, along with rich examples of socially-motivated movement behaviors. For example, the dataset captures instances of individuals navigating around each other in narrow spaces, adjusting paths to respect personal boundaries in living areas, and coordinating movements in high-traffic zones like entryways and kitchens. Our evaluation shows that LocoVR significantly enhances model performance in three practical indoor tasks utilizing human trajectories, and demonstrates predicting socially-aware navigation patterns in home environments",

Our framework introduces a novel perspective to identify how social information can affect an LLM's decision through different causal pathways. Leveraging these causal insights, we outline principled prompting strategies that regulate these pathways through selection mechanisms. This framework not only unifies existing prompting-based debiasing techniques, but also opens up new directions for reducing bias by encouraging the model to prioritize fact-based reasoning over reliance on biased social cues. We validate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across multiple domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in debiasing LLM decisions, even with only black-box access to the model",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is closely tied to the design of prompts, making prompt optimization essential for enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Although recent advancements have focused on automating prompt engineering, many existing approaches rely exclusively on textual feedback, refining prompts based solely on inference errors identified by large, computationally expensive LLMs. Unfortunately, smaller models struggle to generate high-quality feedback, resulting in complete dependence on large LLM judgment. Moreover, these methods fail to leverage more direct and finer-grained information, such as gradients, due to operating purely in text space. To this end, we introduce, we introduce *GReaTer*, a novel prompt optimization technique that directly incorporates *gradient information over task-specific reasoning*. By utilizing task loss gradients, *GReaTer* enables self-optimization of prompts for smaller, lightweight language models (LM) without the need for costly closed-source LLMs, while maintaining reasonable prompt structures. This allows high-performance prompt optimization without dependence on massive LLMs, closing the gap between smaller models and the sophisticated reasoning often needed for prompt refinement. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks demonstrate that \\ours consistently outperforms previous methods, even those reliant on powerful LLMs. Additionally, *GReaTer*-optimized prompts frequently exhibit better transferability and, in some cases, boost task performance to levels comparable to or surpassing those achieved by larger language models, highlighting the effectiveness of *\"gradient over reasoning\"*-based prompt optimization.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Auto-Regressive (AR) models have recently gained prominence in image generation, often matching or even surpassing the performance of diffusion models. However, one major limitation of AR models is their sequential nature, which processes tokens one at a time, slowing down generation compared to models like GANs or diffusion-based methods that operate more efficiently. While speculative decoding has proven effective for accelerating LLMs by generating multiple tokens in a single forward, its application in visual AR models remains largely unexplored. In this work, we identify a challenge in this setting, which we term \\textit{token selection ambiguity}, wherein visual AR models frequently assign uniformly low probabilities to tokens, hampering the performance of speculative decoding. To overcome this challenge, we propose a relaxed acceptance condition referred to as LANTERN that leverages the interchangeability of tokens in latent space. This relaxation restores the effectiveness of speculative decoding in visual AR models by enabling more flexible use of candidate tokens that would otherwise be prematurely rejected. Furthermore, by incorporating a total variation distance bound, we ensure that these speed gains are achieved without significantly compromising image quality or semantic coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in providing a substantial speed-up over speculative decoding. In specific, compared to a na\\\"ive application of the state-of-the-art speculative decoding, LANTERN increases speed-ups by $\\mathbf{1.75}\\times$ and $\\mathbf{1.82}\\times$, as compared to greedy decoding and random sampling, respectively, when applied to LlamaGen, a contemporary visual AR model.

However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting.

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective technique to align LLMs to human preferences, and broader utilities, but it requires updating billions of model parameters which is computationally expensive. Controlled Decoding, by contrast, provides a mechanism for aligning a model at inference time without retraining. However, single-agent decoding approaches often struggle to adapt to diverse tasks due to the complexity and variability inherent in these tasks. To strengthen the test-time performance w.r.t the target task, we propose a mixture of agents-based decoding strategies leveraging the existing off-the-shelf aligned LLM policies. Treating each prior policy as an agent in the spirit of mixture of agent collaboration, we develop a decoding method that allows for inference-time alignment through a token-level selection strategy among multiple agents. For each token, the most suitable LLM is dynamically chosen from a pool of models based on a long-term utility metric. This policy-switching mechanism ensures optimal model selection at each step, enabling efficient collaboration and alignment among LLMs during decoding. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm establishes optimal performance with respect to the target task represented via a target reward, for the given off-the-shelf models. We conduct comprehensive empirical evaluations with open-source aligned models on diverse tasks and preferences, which demonstrates the merits of this approach over single-agent decoding baselines.

    "title": "Finally Rank-Breaking Conquers MNL Bandits: Optimal and Efficient Algorithms for MNL Assortment",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We address the problem of active online assortment optimization problem with preference feedback, which is a framework for modeling user choices and subsetwise utility maximization. The framework is useful in various real-world applications including ad placement, online retail, recommender systems, and fine-tuning language models, amongst many others. The problem, although has been studied in the past, lacks an intuitive and practical solution approach with simultaneously efficient algorithm and optimal regret guarantee. E.g., popularly used assortment selection algorithms often require the presence of a ``strong reference\" which is always included in the choice sets, further they are also designed to offer the same assortments repeatedly until the reference item gets selected---all such requirements are quite unrealistic for practical applications. In this paper, we designed efficient algorithms for the problem of regret minimization in assortment selection with \\emph{Plackett Luce} (PL) based user choices. We designed a novel concentration guarantee for estimating the score parameters of the PL model using `\\emph{Pairwise Rank-Breaking}', which builds the foundation of our proposed algorithms. Moreover, our methods are practical, provably optimal, and devoid of the aforementioned limitations of the existing methods",

    "title": "Efficient Top-m Data Values Identification for Data Selection",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Data valuation has found many real-world applications, e.g., data pricing and data selection. However, the most adopted approach -- Shapley value (SV) -- is computationally expensive due to the large number of model trainings required. Fortunately, most applications (e.g., data selection) require only knowing the $m$ data points with the highest data values (i.e., top-$m$ data values), which implies the potential for fewer model trainings as exact data values are not required. Existing work formulates top-$m$ Shapley value identification as top-$m$ arms identification in multi-armed bandits (MAB). However, the proposed approach falls short because it does not utilize data features to predict data values, a method that has been shown empirically to be effective. A recent top-$m$ arms identification work does consider the use of arm features while assuming a linear relationship between arm features and rewards, which is often not satisfied in data valuation. To this end, we propose the GPGapE algorithm that uses the Gaussian process to model the \\emph{non-linear} mapping from data features to data values, removing the linear assumption. We theoretically analyze the correctness and stopping iteration of GPGapE in finding an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation to the top-$m$ data values. We further improve the computational efficiency, by calculating data values using small data subsets to reduce the computation cost of model training. We empirically demonstrate that GPGapE outperforms other baselines in top-$m$ data values identification, noisy data detection, and data subset selection on real-world datasets. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our GPGapE in data selection for large language model fine-tuning",

    "title": "ScienceAgentBench: Toward Rigorous Assessment of Language Agents for Data-Driven Scientific Discovery",

    "abstract": "The advancements of language language models (LLMs) have piqued growing interest in developing LLM-based language agents to automate scientific discovery end-to-end, which has sparked both excitement and skepticism about the true capabilities of such agents. In this work, we argue that for an agent to fully automate scientific discovery, it must be able to complete all essential tasks in the workflow. Thus, we call for rigorous assessment of agents on individual tasks in a scientific workflow before making bold claims on end-to-end automation. To this end, we present ScienceAgentBench, a new benchmark for evaluating language agents for data-driven scientific discovery. To ensure the scientific authenticity and real-world relevance of our benchmark, we extract 102 tasks from 44 peer-reviewed publications in four disciplines and engage nine subject matter experts to validate them. We unify the target output for every task to a self-contained Python program file and employ an array of evaluation metrics to examine the generated programs, execution results, and costs. Each task goes through multiple rounds of manual validation by annotators and subject matter experts to ensure its annotation quality and scientific plausibility. We also propose two effective strategies to mitigate data contamination concerns. Using our benchmark, we evaluate five open-weight and proprietary LLMs, each with three frameworks: direct prompting, OpenHands, and self-debug. Given three attempts for each task, the best-performing agent can only solve 32.4% of the tasks independently and 34.3% with expert-provided knowledge. These results underscore the limited capacities of current language agents in generating code for data-driven discovery, let alone end-to-end automation for scientific research",

    "abstract": "The memory and computational demands of Key-Value (KV) cache present significant challenges for deploying long-context language models. Previous approaches attempt to mitigate this issue by selectively dropping tokens, which irreversibly erases critical information that might be needed for future queries. In this paper, we propose a novel compression technique for KV cache that preserves all token information. Our investigation reveals that: i) Most attention heads primarily focus on the local context; ii) Only a few heads, denoted as retrieval heads, can essentially pay attention to all input tokens. These key observations motivate us to use separate caching strategy for attention heads.Therefore, we propose RazorAttention, a training-free KV cache compression algorithm, which maintains a full cache for these crucial retrieval heads and discards the remote tokens in non-retrieval heads. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mechanism involving a \"compensation token\" to further recover the information in the dropped tokens. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of large language models (LLMs) demonstrate that RazorAttention achieves a reduction in KV cache size by over 70% without noticeable impacts on performance. Additionally, RazorAttention is compatible with FlashAttention, rendering it an efficient and plug-and-play solution that enhances LLM inference efficiency without overhead or retraining of the original model",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning abilities but face limitations such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Knowledge Graph (KG)-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses these issues by grounding LLM outputs in structured external knowledge from KGs. However, current KG-based RAG frameworks still struggle to optimize the trade-off between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency in identifying a suitable amount of relevant graph information for the LLM to digest. We introduce SubgraphRAG, extending the KG-based RAG framework that retrieves subgraphs and leverages LLMs for reasoning and answer prediction. Our approach innovatively integrates a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a parallel triple-scoring mechanism for efficient and flexible subgraph retrieval while encoding directional structural distances to enhance retrieval effectiveness. The size of retrieved subgraphs can be flexibly adjusted to match the query's needs and the downstream LLM's capabilities. This design strikes a balance between model complexity and reasoning power, enabling scalable and generalizable retrieval processes. Notably, based on our retrieved subgraphs, smaller LLMs like Llama3.1-8B-Instruct deliver competitive results with explainable reasoning, while larger models like GPT-4o achieve state-of-the-art accuracy compared with previous baselines—all without fine-tuning. Extensive evaluations on the WebQSP and CWQ benchmarks highlight SubgraphRAG's strengths in efficiency, accuracy, and reliability by reducing hallucinations and improving response grounding",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Models that rely on subword tokenization have significant drawbacks, such as sensitivity to character-level noise like spelling errors and inconsistent compression rates across different languages and scripts. While character- or byte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not gained widespread adoption—processing raw byte streams without tokenization results in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference inefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of ByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically shorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of encoder layers, a learned delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed and which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively \"merges\" critical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence, leveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued pre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in inference runtime with minimal effect on performance, as measured by bits-per-byte. Additionally, with multilingual training, MrT5 adapts to the orthographic characteristics of each language, learning language-specific compression rates. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on downstream evaluations such as XNLI, TyDi QA, and character-level tasks while reducing sequence lengths by up to 75%. Our approach presents a solution to the practical limitations of existing byte-level models",

The additional goal space introduced by multi-goal problems intensifies the spatial complexity of exploration; meanwhile, the long interaction sequences in long-horizon problems exacerbate the temporal complexity of exploration. Addressing the great exploration challenge posed by multi-goal long-horizon problems depends not only on the design of algorithms but also on the design of environments and the availability of demonstrations to assist in training. To facilitate the above research, we propose a multi-goal long-horizon Reinforcement Learning (RL) environment based on realistic fixed-wing UAV's velocity vector control, named VVC-Gym, and generate multiple demonstration sets of various quality. Through experimentation, we analyze the impact of different environment designs on training, assess the quantity and quality of demonstrations and their influence on training, and assess the effectiveness of various RL algorithms, providing baselines on VVC-Gym and its corresponding demonstrations. The results suggest that VVC-Gym is suitable for studying: (1) the influence of environment designs on addressing multi-goal long-horizon problems with RL.

Commit0 also offers an interactive environment where models receive static analysis and execution feedback on the code they generate. Our experiments demonstrate that while current agents can pass some unit tests, none can yet fully reproduce full libraries.

    "title": "Towards Principled Evaluations of Sparse Autoencoders for Interpretability and Control",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Disentangling model activations into human-interpretable features is a central problem in interpretability. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently attracted much attention as a scalable unsupervised approach to this problem. However, our imprecise understanding of ground-truth features in realistic scenarios makes it difficult to measure the success of SAEs. To address this challenge, we propose to evaluate SAEs on specific tasks by comparing them to supervised feature dictionaries computed with knowledge of the concepts relevant to the task. Specifically, we suggest that it is possible to (1) compute supervised sparse feature dictionaries that disentangle model computations for a specific task; (2) use them to evaluate and contextualize the degree of disentanglement and control offered by SAE latents on this task. Importantly, we can do this in a way that is agnostic to whether the SAEs have learned the exact ground-truth features or a different but similarly useful representation. As a case study, we apply this framework to the indirect object identification (IOI) task using GPT-2 Small, with SAEs trained on either the IOI or OpenWebText datasets. We find that SAEs capture interpretable features for the IOI task, and that more recent SAE variants such as Gated SAEs and Top-K SAEs are competitive with supervised features in terms of disentanglement and control over the model. We also exhibit, through this setup and toy models, some qualitative phenomena in SAE training illustrating feature splitting and the role of feature magnitudes in solutions preferred by SAEs",

    "abstract": "Due to the rise in antimicrobial resistance, identifying novel compounds with antibiotic potential is crucial for combatting this global health issue. However, traditional drug development methods are costly and inefficient. Recognizing the pressing need for more effective solutions, researchers have turned to machine learning techniques to streamline the prediction and development of novel antibiotic compounds. While foundation models have shown promise in antibiotic discovery, current mainstream efforts still fall short of fully leveraging the potential of multimodal molecular data. Recent studies suggest that contrastive learning frameworks utilizing multimodal data exhibit excellent performance in representation learning across various domains. Building upon this, we introduce CL-MFAP, an unsupervised contrastive learning (CL)-based multimodal foundation (MF) model specifically tailored for discovering small molecules with potential antibiotic properties (AP) using three types of molecular data. This model employs 1.6 million bioactive molecules with drug-like properties from the ChEMBL dataset to jointly pretrain three encoders: (1) a transformer-based encoder with rotary position embedding for processing SMILES strings; (2) another transformer-based encoder, incorporating a novel bi-level routing attention mechanism to handle molecular graph representations; and (3) a Morgan fingerprint encoder using a multilayer perceptron, to achieve the contrastive learning purpose. The CL-MFAP outperforms baseline models in antibiotic property prediction by effectively utilizing different molecular modalities and demonstrates superior domain-specific performance when fine-tuned for antibiotic-related property prediction tasks",

In this paper, we introduce SeedLM, a novel post-training compression method that uses seeds of a pseudo-random generator to encode and compress model weights. Specifically, for each block of weights, we find a seed that is fed into a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) during inference to efficiently generate a random matrix. This matrix is then linearly combined with compressed coefficients to reconstruct the weight block. SeedLM reduces memory access and leverages idle compute cycles during inference, effectively speeding up memory-bound tasks by trading compute for fewer memory accesses. Unlike state-of-the-art methods that rely on calibration data, our approach is data-free and generalizes well across diverse tasks. Our experiments with Llama3 70B, which is particularly challenging, show zero-shot accuracy retention at 4- and 3-bit compression to be on par with or better than state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining performance comparable to FP16 baselines.

    "abstract": "As language models (LMs) are used to build autonomous agents in real environments, ensuring their adversarial robustness becomes a critical challenge. Unlike chatbots, agents are compound systems with multiple components taking actions, which existing LMs safety evaluations do not adequately address. To bridge this gap, we manually create 200 targeted adversarial tasks and evaluation scripts in a realistic threat model on top of VisualWebArena, a real environment for web agents. To systematically examine the robustness of agents, we propose the Agent Robustness Evaluation (ARE) framework. ARE views the agent as a graph showing the flow of intermediate outputs between components and decomposes robustness as the flow of adversarial information on the graph. We find that we can successfully break latest agents that use black-box frontier LMs, including those that perform reflection and tree search. With imperceptible perturbations to a single image (less than 5% of total web page pixels), an attacker can hijack these agents to execute targeted adversarial goals with success rates up to 67%. We also use ARE to rigorously evaluate how the robustness changes as new components are added. We find that inference-time compute that typically improves benign performance can open up new vulnerabilities and harm robustness. An attacker can compromise the evaluator used by the reflexion agent and the value function of the tree search agent, which increases the attack success relatively by 15% and 20%.

This can be effective for tasks such as information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define \"coherent factuality\" and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal prediction to subgraphs within a \"deducibility\" graph that represents the steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving coherent factuality across target coverage levels.

These experiments are expensive, so one might hope to reduce their cost by only experimenting on a subset of the compounds, and predicting the outcomes of the remaining experiments. In this work, we model this scenario as a sequential subset selection problem: we aim to select the smallest set of candidates in order to achieve some desired level of accuracy for the system as a whole. Our key observation is that, if there is heterogeneity in the difficulty of the prediction problem across the input space, selectively obtaining the labels for the hardest examples in the acquisition pool will leave only the relatively easy examples to remain in the inference set, leading to better overall system performance. We call this mechanism inference set design, and propose the use of a confidence-based active learning solution to prune out these challenging examples. Our algorithm includes an explicit stopping criterion that interrupts the acquisition loop when it is sufficiently confident that the system has reached the target performance.

We propose *uncertainty coverage*, an objective which generalizes a variety of low- and high-budget objectives, as well as natural, hyperparameter-light methods to smoothly interpolate between low- and high-budget regimes. We call greedy optimization of the estimate Uncertainty Herding; this simple method is computationally fast, and we prove that it nearly optimizes the distribution-level coverage. In experimental validation across a variety of active learning tasks, our proposal matches or beats state-of-the-art performance in essentially all cases; it is the only method of which we are aware that reliably works well in both low- and high-budget settings",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The evolution of biological neural systems has led to both modularity and sparse coding, which enables energy efficiency and robustness across the diversity of tasks in the lifespan. In contrast, standard neural networks rely on dense, non-specialized architectures, where all model parameters are simultaneously updated to learn multiple tasks, leading to interference. Current sparse neural network approaches aim to alleviate this issue but are hindered by limitations such as 1) trainable gating functions that cause representation collapse, 2) disjoint experts that result in redundant computation and slow learning, and 3) reliance on explicit input or task IDs that limit flexibility and scalability. In this paper we propose Conditionally Overlapping Mixture of ExperTs (COMET), a general deep learning method that addresses these challenges by inducing a modular, sparse architecture with an exponential number of overlapping experts. COMET replaces the trainable gating function used in Sparse Mixture of Experts with a fixed, biologically inspired random projection applied to individual input representations. This design causes the degree of expert overlap to depend on input similarity, so that similar inputs tend to share more parameters. This results in faster learning per update step and improved out-of-sample generalization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMET on a range of tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and regression, using several popular deep learning architectures",

    "title": "Can Watermarks be Used to Detect LLM IP Infringement For Free?",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The powerful capabilities of LLMs stem from their rich training data and high-quality labeled datasets, making the training of strong LLMs a resource-intensive process, which elevates the importance of IP protection for such LLMs. Compared to gathering high-quality labeled data, directly sampling outputs from these fully trained LLMs as training data presents a more cost-effective approach. This practice—where a suspect model is fine-tuned using high-quality data derived from these LLMs, thereby gaining capabilities similar to the target model—can be seen as a form of IP infringement against the original LLM. In recent years, LLM watermarks have been proposed and used to detect whether a text is AI-generated. Intuitively, if data sampled from a watermarked LLM is used for training, the resulting model would also be influenced by this watermark. This raises the question: can we directly use such watermarks to detect IP infringement of LLMs? In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM watermarks for detecting model infringement. We find that there are two issues with direct detection: (1) The queries used to sample output from the suspect LLM have a significant impact on detectability. (2) The watermark that is easily learned by LLMs exhibits instability regarding the watermark's hash key during detection. To address these issues, we propose LIDet, a detection method that leverages available anchor LLMs to select suitable queries for sampling from the suspect LLM. Additionally, it adapts the detection threshold to mitigate detection failures caused by different hash keys. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we construct a challenging model set containing multiple suspect LLMs on which direct detection methods struggle to yield effective results. Our method achieves over 90\\% accuracy in distinguishing between infringing and clean models, demonstrating the feasibility of using LLM watermarks to detect LLM IP infringement",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformer models exhibit immense power yet remain opaque to human understanding, posing challenges and risks for practical applications. While prior research has attempted to demystify these models through input attribution and neuron role analysis, there's been a notable gap in considering layer-level information and the holistic path of information flow across layers. In this paper, we investigate the significance of influential neuron paths within vision Transformers, which is a path of neurons from the model input to output that impacts the model inference most significantly. We first propose a joint influence measure to assess the contribution of a set of neurons to the model outcome. And we further provide a layer-progressive neuron locating approach that efficiently selects the most influential neuron at each layer trying to discover the crucial neuron path from input to output within the target model. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method finding the most influential neuron path along which the information flows, over the existing baseline solutions. Additionally, the neuron paths have illustrated that vision Transformers exhibit some specific inner working mechanism for processing the visual information within the same image category. We further analyze the key effects of these neurons on the image classification task, showcasing that the found neuron paths have already preserved the model capability on downstream tasks, which may also shed some lights on real-world applications like model pruning.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The infinite width limit of random neural networks is known to result in Neural Networks as Gaussian Process (NNGP) (Lee et al. (2018)), characterized by task-independent kernels. It is widely accepted that larger network widths contribute to improved generalization (Park et al. (2019)). However, this work challenges this notion by investigating the narrow width limit of the Bayesian Parallel Branching Neural Network (BPB-NN), an architecture that resembles neural networks with residual blocks. We demonstrate that when the width of a BPB-NN is significantly smaller compared to the number of training examples, each branch exhibits more robust learning due to a symmetry breaking of branches in kernel renormalization. Surprisingly, the performance of a BPB-NN in the narrow width limit is generally superior to or comparable to that achieved in the wide width limit in bias-limited scenarios. Furthermore, the readout norms of each branch in the narrow width limit are mostly independent of the architectural hyperparameters but generally reflective of the nature of the data. We demonstrate such phenomenon primarily in the branching graph neural networks, where each branch represents a different order of convolutions of the graph; we also extend the results to other more general architectures such as the residual-MLP and demonstrate that the narrow width effect is a general feature of the branching networks. Our results characterize a newly defined narrow-width regime for parallel branching networks in general",

Preference-based feedback, often implemented as a binary comparison between multiple completions, is an established method to acquire large-scale human feedback. However, human feedback in other contexts is often much more diverse. Such diverse feedback can better support the goals of a human annotator, and the simultaneous use of multiple sources might be mutually informative for the learning process or carry type-dependent biases for the reward learning process. Despite these potential benefits, learning from different feedback types has yet to be explored extensively. In this paper, we bridge this gap by enabling experimentation and evaluating multi-type feedback in a wide set of environments. We present a process to generate high-quality simulated feedback of six different types. Then, we implement reward models and downstream RL training for all six feedback types. Based on the simulated feedback, we investigate the use of types of feedback across ten RL environments and compare them to pure preference-based baselines. We show empirically that diverse types of feedback can be utilized and lead to strong reward modeling performance.

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of test-time compute search strategies to improve the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the need for building robust verifiers has become increasingly important. However, all these inference strategies rely on existing verifiers originally designed for Best-of-N search, which makes them sub-optimal for tree search techniques at test time. During tree search, existing verifiers can only offer indirect and implicit assessments of partial solutions or under-value prospective intermediate steps, thus resulting in the premature pruning of promising intermediate steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose token-supervised value models (TVMs) -- a new class of verifiers that assign each token a probability that reflects the likelihood of reaching the correct final answer. This new token-level supervision enables TVMs to directly and explicitly evaluate partial solutions, effectively distinguishing between promising and incorrect intermediate steps during tree search at test time. Experimental results demonstrate that combining tree-search-based inference strategies with TVMs significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in mathematical problem-solving tasks, surpassing the performance of existing verifiers",

For example, we may want a proof to adhere to a certain style, be declaratively structured, or concise. Having suitably optimized proofs is also important for learning tasks, especially since human-written proofs may not optimal for that purpose. To this end, we study a new problem of automated proof optimization: rewriting a proof so that it is correct and optimizes for an arbitrary criterion, such as length or declarativity. As a first method for automated proof optimization, we present ImProver, a large-language-model agent that rewrites proofs to optimize arbitrary user-defined metrics in Lean. We find that naively applying LLMs to proof optimization falls short, and we incorporate various improvements into ImProver, such as the use of symbolic Lean context in a novel Chain-of-States technique, as well as error-correction and retrieval. We test ImProver on rewriting real-world undergraduate, competition, and research-level mathematics theorems, finding that ImProver is capable of rewriting proofs so that they are substantially shorter and more declarative in structure",

In this paper, we present L-RHO, the first learning-guided RHO framework for COPs. L-RHO employs a neural network to intelligently fix variables that in hindsight did not need to be re-optimized, resulting in smaller and thus easier-to-solve subproblems. For FJSP, this means identifying operations with unchanged machine assignments between consecutive subproblems. Applied to FJSP, L-RHO accelerates RHO by up to 54\\% while significantly improving solution quality, outperforming other heuristic and learning-based baselines.

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of text generation, producing outputs that closely mimic human-like writing. Although academic and industrial institutions have developed detectors to prevent the malicious usage of LLM-generated texts, other research has doubt about the robustness of these systems. To stress test these detectors, we introduce a humanized proxy-attack (HUMPA) strategy that effortlessly compromises LLMs, causing them to produce outputs that align with human-written text and mislead detection systems. Our method attacks the source model by leveraging a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuned humanized small language model (SLM) in the decoding phase. Through an in-depth analysis, we demonstrate that our attack strategy is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable to detectors, preventing them from differentiating between machine-generated and human-written text. We conduct systematic evaluations on extensive datasets using proxy-attacked open-source models, including Llama2-13B, Llama3-70B, and Mixtral-8x7B in both white- and black-box settings. Our findings show that the proxy-attack strategy effectively deceives the leading detectors, resulting in an average AUROC drop of 70.4% across multiple datasets, with a maximum drop of 95.0% on a single dataset. Furthermore, in cross-discipline scenarios, our strategy also bypasses these detectors, leading to a significant relative decrease of up to 90.9%, while in cross-language scenario, the drop reaches 91.3%. Despite our proxy-attack strategy successfully bypassing the detectors with such significant relative drops, we find that the generation quality of the attacked models remains preserved, even within a modest utility budget, when compared to the text produced by the original, unattacked source model",

    "abstract": "We introduce Probe Pruning (PP), a novel framework for online, dynamic, structured pruning of Large Language Models (LLMs) applied in a batch-wise manner. PP leverages the insight that not all samples and tokens contribute equally to the model's output, and probing a small portion of each batch effectively identifies crucial weights, enabling tailored dynamic pruning for different batches. It comprises three main stages: probing, history-informed pruning, and full inference. In the probing stage, PP selects a small yet crucial set of hidden states, based on residual importance, to run a few model layers ahead. During the history-informed pruning stage, PP strategically integrates the probing states with historical states. Subsequently, it structurally prunes weights based on the integrated states and the PP importance score, a metric developed specifically to assess the importance of each weight channel in maintaining performance. In the final stage, full inference is conducted on the remaining weights. A major advantage of PP is its compatibility with existing models, as it operates without requiring additional neural network modules or fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations of PP on LLaMA-2/3 and OPT models reveal that even minimal probing—using just 1.5% of FLOPs—can substantially enhance the efficiency of structured pruning of LLMs. For instance, when evaluated on LLaMA-2-7B with WikiText2, PP achieves a 2.56 times lower ratio of performance degradation per unit of latency reduction compared to the state-of-the-art method at a 40\\% pruning ratio",

There is an emerging need and interest in automating web tasks (e.g., booking a hotel for a given date within a budget). Being a practical use case itself, the web agent also serves as an important proof-of-concept example for various agent grounding scenarios, with its success promising advancements in many future applications. Meanwhile, much prior research focuses on handcrafting their web agent strategies (e.g., agent's prompting templates, reflective workflow, role-play and multi-agent systems, search or sampling methods, etc.) and the corresponding in-context examples. However, these custom strategies often struggle with generalizability across all potential real-world applications. On the other hand, there has been limited study on the misalignment between a web agent's observation and action representation, and the data on which the agent's underlying LLM has been pre-trained. This discrepancy is especially notable when LLMs are primarily trained for language completion rather than tasks involving embodied navigation actions and symbolic web elements. In our study, we enhance an LLM-based web agent by simply refining its observation and action space, aligning these more closely with the LLM's capabilities. This approach enables our base agent to significantly outperform previous methods on a wide variety of web tasks. Specifically, on WebArena, a benchmark featuring general-purpose web interaction tasks, our agent AgentOccam surpasses the previous state-of-the-art and concurrent work by 9.8 (+29.4%) and 5.9 (+15.8%) absolute points respectively, and boosts the success rate by 26.6 points (+161%) over similar plain web agents with its observation and action space alignment. Furthermore, on WebVoyager benchmark comprising tasks defined on real-world websites, AgentOccam exceeds the former best agent by 2.4 points (+4.6%) on tasks with deterministic answers. We achieve this without using in-context examples, new agent roles, online feedback or search strategies. AgentOccam's simple design highlights LLMs' impressive zero-shot performance on web tasks, and underlines the critical role of carefully tuning observation and action spaces for LLM-based agents",

Depending on the availability of preference data, both online and offline RLHF are active areas of investigation. A key bottleneck is understanding how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in the reward function learned from the preference data for RLHF, regardless of how the preference data is collected. While the principles of optimism or pessimism under uncertainty are well-established in standard reinforcement learning (RL), a practically-implementable and theoretically-grounded form amenable to large language models is not yet available, as standard techniques for constructing confidence intervals become intractable under arbitrary policy parameterizations. In this paper, we introduce a unified approach to online and offline RLHF --- value-incentivized preference optimization (VPO) --- which regularizes the maximum-likelihood estimate of the reward function with the corresponding value function, modulated by a sign to indicate whether the optimism or pessimism is chosen. VPO also directly optimizes the policy with implicit reward modeling, and therefore shares a simpler RLHF pipeline similar to direct preference optimization. Theoretical guarantees of VPO are provided for both online and offline settings, matching the rates of their standard RL counterparts. Moreover, experiments on text summarization, dialogue, and standard benchmarks verify the practicality and effectiveness of VPO",

In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work.

    "abstract": "Vision language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption in recent years, but many still struggle with basic spatial reasoning errors. We hypothesize that this is due to VLMs adopting pre-trained vision backbones, specifically vision transformers (ViTs) trained with image-level supervision and minimal inductive biases. Such models may fail to encode the class contents at each position in the image, and our goal is to resolve this with a vision backbone that effectively captures both local and global image semantics. Our main insight is that we do not require new supervision to learn this capability – pre-trained models contain significant knowledge of local semantics that we can extract and use for scalable self-supervision. We propose a new efficient post-training stage for ViTs called locality alignment and a novel fine-tuning procedure called MaskEmbed that uses a masked reconstruction loss to learn semantic contributions for each image patch. We first evaluate locality alignment with a vision-only benchmark, finding that it improves a model's performance at patch-level semantic segmentation, especially for strong backbones trained with image-caption pairs (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP). We then train a series of VLMs with and without locality alignment, and show that locality-aligned backbones improve performance across a range of benchmarks, particularly ones that involve spatial understanding (e.g., RefCOCO, OCID-Ref, TallyQA, VSR, AI2D). Overall, we demonstrate that we can efficiently learn local semantic extraction via a locality alignment stage, and that this procedure benefits VLM training recipes that use off-the-shelf vision backbones",

    "title": "Benign Overfitting in Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Linear Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Benign overfitting refers to the phenomenon where an over-parameterized model fits the training data perfectly, including noise in the data, but still generalizes well to the unseen test data. While prior work provides some theoretical understanding of this phenomenon under the in-distribution setup, modern machine learning often operates in a more challenging Out-of-Distribution (OOD) regime, where the target (test) distribution can be rather different from the source (training) distribution. In this work, we take an initial step towards understanding benign overfitting in the OOD regime by focusing on the basic setup of over-parameterized linear models under covariate shift. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees proving that benign overfitting occurs in standard ridge regression, even under the OOD regime when the target covariance satisfies certain structural conditions. We identify several vital quantities relating to source and target covariance, which govern the performance of OOD generalization. Our result is sharp, which provably recovers prior in-distribution benign overfitting guarantee (Tsigler & Bartlett, 2023), as well as under-parameterized OOD guarantee (Ge et al., 2024) when specializing to each setup. Moreover, we also present theoretical results for a more general family of target covariance matrix, where standard ridge regression only achieves a slow statistical rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for the excess risk, while Principal Component Regression (PCR) is guaranteed to achieve the fast rate $\\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs with no fine-tuning, enabling them to handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an online fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient, human-inspired access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench and $\\infty$-Bench benchmarks demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art retrieval model InfLLM across various baseline LLMs. In addition, EM-LLM outperforms its popular counterpart, RAG, in a wide range of tasks, while requiring similar resources. Notably, EM-LLM's performance even surpasses full-context models in most tasks, while successfully performing retrieval across 10 million tokens -- a scale computationally infeasible for such models. Finally, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting parallels between this artificial system and its biological counterpart, thereby offering a novel computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms",

    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive finite-time global convergence analysis of policy gradient for infinite horizon average reward Markov decision processes (MDPs). Specifically, we focus on ergodic tabular MDPs with finite state and action spaces. Our analysis shows that the policy gradient iterates converge to the optimal policy at a sublinear rate of $O(\\frac{1}{T})$, where $T$ represents the number of iterations. Performance bounds for discounted reward MDPs cannot be easily extended to average reward MDPs as the bounds grow proportional to the fifth power of the effective horizon. Recent work on such extensions makes a smoothness assumption that has not been verified. Thus, our primary contribution is in providing the first complete proof that the policy gradient algorithm converges globally for average-reward MDPs, without such an assumption. We also obtain the corresponding finite-time performance guarantees. In contrast to the existing discounted reward performance bounds, our performance bounds have an explicit dependence on constants that capture the complexity of the underlying MDP. Motivated by this observation, we reexamine and improve the existing performance bounds for discounted reward MDPs. We also present simulations that empirically validate the result",

As a result, 1000s of hours have been spent on building such large-scale datasets around the globe. Despite the continuous growth of such efforts, we still lack a systematic understanding of what data should be collected to improve the utility of a robotics dataset and facilitate downstream policy learning. In this work, we conduct a large-scale dataset composition study to answer this question. We develop a data generation framework to procedurally emulate common sources of diversity in existing datasets (such as sensor placements and object types and arrangements), and use it to generate large-scale robot datasets with controlled compositions, enabling a suite of dataset composition studies that would be prohibitively expensive in the real world. We focus on two practical settings: (1) what types of diversity should be emphasized when future researchers collect large-scale datasets for robotics, and (2) how should current practitioners retrieve relevant demonstrations from existing datasets to maximize downstream policy performance on tasks of interest. Our study yields several critical insights -- for example, we find that camera poses and spatial arrangements are crucial dimensions for both diversity in collection and alignment in retrieval. In real-world robot learning settings, we find that not only do our insights from simulation carry over, but our retrieval strategies on existing datasets such as DROID allow us to consistently outperform existing training strategies by up to 70\\%",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Robot learning requires a considerable amount of high-quality data to realize the promise of generalization. However, large data sets are costly to collect in the real world. Physics simulators can cheaply generate vast data sets with broad coverage over states, actions, and environments. However, physics engines are fundamentally misspecified approximations to reality. This makes direct zero-shot transfer from simulation to reality challenging, especially in tasks where precise and force-sensitive manipulation is necessary. Thus, fine-tuning these policies with small real-world data sets is an appealing pathway for scaling robot learning. However, current reinforcement learning fine-tuning frameworks leverage general, unstructured exploration strategies which are too inefficient to make real-world adaptation practical. This paper introduces the \\emph{Simulation-Guided Fine-tuning} (SGFT) framework, which demonstrates how to extract structural priors from physics simulators to substantially accelerate real-world adaptation. Specifically, our approach uses a value function learned in simulation to guide real-world exploration. We demonstrate this approach across five real-world dexterous manipulation tasks where zero-shot sim-to-real transfer fails. We further demonstrate our framework substantially outperforms baseline fine-tuning methods, requiring up to an order of magnitude fewer real-world samples and succeeding at difficult tasks where prior approaches fail entirely. Last but not least, we provide theoretical justification for this new paradigm which underpins how SGFT can rapidly learn high-performance policies in the face of large sim-to-real dynamics gaps",

    "abstract": "Object-centric representation learning has recently been successfully applied to real-world datasets. This success can be attributed to pretrained non-object-centric foundation models, whose features serve as reconstruction targets for slot attention. However, targets must remain frozen throughout the training, which sets an upper bound on the performance object-centric models can attain. Attempts to update the target encoder by bootstrapping result in large performance drops, which can be attributed to its lack of object-centric inductive biases, causing the object-centric model's encoder to drift away from representations useful as reconstruction targets. To address these limitations, we propose **O**bject-**CE**ntric Pretraining by Target Encoder **BO**otstrapping, a self-distillation setup for training object-centric models from scratch, on real-world data, for the first time ever. In OCEBO, the target encoder is updated as an exponential moving average of the object-centric model, thus explicitly being enriched with object-centric inductive biases introduced by slot attention while removing the upper bound on performance present in other models. We mitigate the slot collapse caused by random initialization of the target encoder by introducing a novel cross-view patch filtering approach that limits the supervision to sufficiently informative patches. When pretrained on 241k images from COCO, OCEBO achieves unsupervised object discovery performance comparable to that of object-centric models with frozen non-object-centric target encoders pretrained on hundreds of millions of images.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have led to the emergence of Vision-Language Generalists (VLGs) capable of understanding and generating both text and images. However, seamlessly generating an arbitrary sequence of text and images remains a challenging task for the current VLGs. One primary limitation lies in applying a unified architecture and the same set of parameters to simultaneously model discrete text tokens and continuous image features. Recent works attempt to tackle this fundamental problem by introducing modality-aware expert models. However, they employ identical architectures to process both text and images, disregarding the intrinsic inductive biases in these two modalities. In this work, we introduce Modality-Specialized Synergizers (MoSS), a novel design that efficiently optimizes existing unified architectures of VLGs with modality-specialized adaptation layers, i.e., a Convolutional LoRA for modeling the local priors of image patches and a Linear LoRA for processing sequential text. This design enables more effective modeling of modality-specific features while maintaining the strong cross-modal integration gained from pretraining. In addition, to improve the instruction-following capability on interleaved text-and-image generation, we introduce LeafInstruct, the first open-sourced interleaved instruction tuning dataset comprising 184,982 high-quality instances on more than 10 diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that VLGs integrated with MoSS achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing baseline VLGs in complex interleaved generation tasks.

Across a battery of continual learning problems and network architectures, we demonstrate that SNR consistently attains superior performance compared to its competitor algorithms. We also demonstrate that SNR is robust to its sole hyperparameter, its rejection percentile threshold, while competitor algorithms show significant sensitivity. SNR's threshold-based reset mechanism is motivated by a simple hypothesis test we derive. Seen through the lens of this hypothesis test, competing reset proposals yield suboptimal error rates in correctly detecting inactive neurons, potentially explaining our experimental observations. We also conduct a theoretical investigation of the optimization landscape for the problem of learning a single ReLU. We show that even when initialized adversarially, an idealized version of SNR learns the target ReLU, while regularization based approaches can fail to learn",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Pretraining data has a direct impact on the behaviors and quality of language models (LMs), but we only understand the most basic principles of this relationship. While most work focuses on pretraining data's effect on downstream task behavior, we investigate its relationship to LM representations. Previous work has discovered that, in language models, some concepts are encoded \"linearly\" in the representations, but what factors cause these representations to form (or not)? We study the connection between pretraining data frequency and models' linear representations of factual relations (e.g., mapping France to Paris in a capital prediction task). We find evidence that the formation of linear representations is strongly connected to pretraining term frequencies; specifically for subject-relation-object fact triplets, both subject-object co-occurrence frequency and in-context learning accuracy for the relation are highly correlated with linear representations. This is the case across all phases of pretraining, i.e., it is not affected by the model's underlying capability. In OLMo-7B and GPT-J (6B), we discover that a linear representation consistently (but not exclusively) forms when the subjects and objects within a relation co-occur at least 1k and 2k times, respectively, regardless of when these occurrences happen during pretraining (and around 4k times for OLMo-1B). Finally, we train a regression model on measurements of linear representation quality in fully-trained LMs that can predict how often a term was seen in pretraining. Our model achieves low error even on inputs from a different model with a different pretraining dataset, providing a new method for estimating properties of the otherwise-unknown training data of closed-data models. We conclude that the strength of linear representations in LMs contains signal about the models' pretraining corpora that may provide new avenues for controlling and improving model behavior: particularly, manipulating the models' training data to meet specific frequency thresholds.

We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking.

In this paper, we introduce per-topic severity rubrics for 11 harmful topics and build BingoGuard, an LLM-based moderation system designed to predict both binary safety labels and severity levels. To address the lack of annotations on levels of severity, we propose a scalable generate-then-filter framework that first generates responses across different severity levels and then filters out low-quality responses. Using this framework, we create BingoGuardTrain, a training dataset with 54,897 examples covering a variety of topics, response severity, styles, and BingoGuardTest, a test set with 988 examples explicitly labeled based on our severity rubrics that enables fine-grained analysis on model behaviors on different severity levels.

In practice, over-generalization often occurs with unexpectedly well reconstruction of anomalies. Although memory banks are employed by reconstruction-based models to fight against over-generalization, these models are only efficient to detect point anomalies since they learn normal prototypes from time points, leaving interval anomalies and periodical anomalies to be discovered. To settle this problem, this paper propose a hybrid prototypes learning model for MTSAD based on reconstruction, named as H-PAD. First, normal prototypes are learned from different sizes of the patches for time series to discover interval anomalies. These prototypes in different sizes are integrated together to reconstruct query series so that any anomalies would be smoothed off and high reconstruction errors are produced. Furthermore, period prototypes are learned to discover periodical anomalies. One period prototype is memorized for one variable of the query series.

In this work, we make a stronger claim --- many reasoning problems require a large depth but not necessarily many parameters. This unlocks a novel application of looped models for reasoning. Firstly, we show that for many synthetic reasoning problems like addition, $p$-hop induction, and math problems, a $k$-layer transformer looped $L$ times nearly matches the performance of a $kL$-layer non-looped model, and is significantly better than a $k$-layer model. This is further corroborated by theoretical results showing that many such reasoning problems can be solved via iterative algorithms, and thus, can be solved effectively using looped models with nearly optimal depth. Perhaps surprisingly, these benefits also translate to practical settings of language modeling --- on many downstream reasoning tasks, a language model with $k$-layers looped $L$ times can be competitive to, if not better than, a $kL$-layer language model. In fact, our empirical analysis reveals an intriguing phenomenon: looped and non-looped models exhibit scaling behavior that depends on their effective depth, akin to the inference-time scaling of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We further elucidate the connection to CoT reasoning by proving that looped models implicitly generate latent thoughts and can simulate $T$ steps of CoT with $T$ loops. Inspired by these findings, we also present an interesting dichotomy between reasoning and memorization, and design a looping-based regularization that is effective on both fronts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Conservative Contextual Bandits (CCBs) address safety in sequential decision making by requiring that an agent's policy, along with minimizing regret, also satisfies a safety constraint: the performance is not worse than a baseline policy (e.g., the policy that the company has in production) by more than $(1+\\alpha)$ factor. Prior work developed UCB-style algorithms for this problem in the multi-armed (Wu et al., 2016) and contextual linear (Kazerouni et al., 2017) settings. However, in practice the cost of the arms is often a non-linear function, and therefore existing UCB algorithms are ineffective in such settings. In this paper, we consider CCBs beyond the linear case and develop two algorithms $\\mathtt{C\\text{-}SquareCB}$ and $\\mathtt{C\\text{-}FastCB}$, using Inverse Gap Weighting (IGW) based exploration and an online regression oracle. We show that the safety constraint is satisfied in high probability and that the regret for $\\mathtt{C\\text{-}SquareCB}$ is sub-linear in horizon $T$, while the the regret for $\\mathtt{C\\text{-}FastCB}$ is first-order and is sub-linear in $L^*$, the cumulative loss of the optimal policy. Subsequently, we use a neural network for function approximation and online gradient descent as the regression oracle to provide $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big(\\sqrt{KT} + K/\\alpha\\big) $ and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big(\\sqrt{KL^*} + K (1 + 1/\\alpha)\\big)$ regret bounds respectively.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold---referred to as critical complexity---where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28 LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and closed-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose \\sys to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, \\sys achieves around 30\\% to 70\\% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 $\\times$ of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

Unlike traditional energy-based methods, DEPfold learns directly from annotated data and leverages pretrained language models to predict RNA structure. We evaluate DEPfold on both within-family and cross-family RNA datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing methods. DEPfold shows strong performance in cross-family generalization when trained on data augmented by traditional energy-based models, outperforming existing methods on the bpRNAnew dataset.

    "abstract": "Context-augmented generation (CAG) techniques, including RAG and ICL, require the efficient combination of multiple contexts to generate responses to user queries. Directly inputting these contexts as a sequence introduces a considerable computational burden by re-encoding the combined selection of contexts for every request. To address this, we explore the promising potential of parallel encoding to independently pre-compute and cache each context's KV states. This approach enables the direct loading of cached states during inference while accommodating more contexts through position reuse across contexts. However, due to misalignments in attention distribution, directly applying parallel encoding results in a significant performance drop. To enable effective and efficient CAG, we propose Adaptive Parallel Encoding (**APE**), which brings shared prefix, attention temperature, and scaling factor to align the distribution of parallel encoding with sequential encoding. Results on RAG and ICL tasks demonstrate that APE can preserve 98\\% and 93\\% sequential encoding performance using the same inputs while outperforming parallel encoding by 3.6\\% and 7.9\\%, respectively. It also scales to many-shot CAG, effectively encoding hundreds of contexts in parallel.

    "abstract": "Language model performance depends on identifying the optimal mixture of data groups to train on (e.g., law, code, math). Prior work has proposed a diverse set of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting regression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions throughout training. Surprisingly, we find that no existing method consistently outperforms a simple stratified sampling baseline in terms of average test perplexity. To understand this inconsistency, we unify existing methods into a standard framework, showing they are equivalent to solving a common optimization problem: minimize average loss subject to a method-specific mixing law---an implicit assumption on the relationship between loss and mixture proportions. This framework suggests that measuring the fidelity of a method's mixing law can offer insights into its performance. Empirically, we find that existing methods set their mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in the inconsistent mixing performance we observe. Using this insight, we derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates the mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically adjust proportions. Empirically, Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out of 6 datasets by an average of 0.27 test perplexity points, whereas existing methods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points worse. Moreover, in a practical setting where proportions are learned on shorter runs due to computational constraints, Aioli can dynamically adjust these proportions over the full training run, consistently improving performance over existing methods by up to 12.012 test perplexity points",

    "abstract": "How do we know if two systems - biological or artificial - process information in a similar way? Similarity measures such as linear regression, Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), Normalized Bures Similarity (NBS), and angular Procrustes distance, are often used to quantify this similarity. However, it is currently unclear what drives high similarity scores and even what constitutes a \"good\" score. Here, we introduce a novel tool to investigate these questions by differentiating through similarity measures to directly maximize the score. Surprisingly, we find that high similarity scores do not guarantee encoding task-relevant information in a manner consistent with neural data; and this is particularly acute for CKA and even some variations of cross-validated and regularized linear regression. We find no consistent threshold for a good similarity score - it depends on both the measure and the dataset. In addition, synthetic datasets optimized to maximize similarity scores initially learn the highest variance principal component of the target dataset, but some methods like angular Procrustes capture lower variance dimensions much earlier than methods like CKA. To shed light on this, we mathematically derive the sensitivity of CKA, angular Procrustes, and NBS to the variance of principal component dimensions, and explain the emphasis CKA places on high variance components. Finally, by jointly optimizing multiple similarity measures, we characterize their allowable ranges and reveal that some similarity measures are more constraining than others. While current measures offer a seemingly straightforward way to quantify the similarity between neural systems, our work underscores the need for careful interpretation.

Unlike fully digital algorithms, hybrid LNLS has no non-asymptotic convergence guarantees and no principled hyperparameter selection schemes, particularly limiting cross-device training and inference. In this work, we provide non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for hybrid LNLS by reducing to block Langevin Diffusion (BLD) algorithms. Adapting tools from classical sampling theory, we prove exponential KL-divergence convergence for randomized and cyclic block selection strategies using ideal DXs. With finite device variation, we provide explicit bounds on the 2-Wasserstein bias in terms of step duration, noise strength, and function parameters.

In this work, we propose a principled surrogate-based approach compatible with deep learning to solve VIs.

Training LLMs with billions of parameters and trillions of tokens requires sophisticated distributed systems that enable composing and comparing several state-of-the-art techniques in order to efficiently scale across thousands of accelerators. However, existing solutions are complex, scattered across multiple libraries/repositories, lack interoperability, and are cumbersome to maintain. Thus, curating and empirically comparing training recipes requires non-trivial engineering effort. This paper introduces **TORCHTITAN**$^1$, a PyTorch-native distributed training system that unifies and advances state-of-the-art techniques, streamlining integration and reducing engineering overhead. TORCHTITAN enables seamless application of 4D parallelism in a modular and composable manner, while featuring elastic scaling to adapt to changing computational requirements. The system provides comprehensive logging, efficient checkpointing, and debugging tools, ensuring production-ready training. Moreover, TORCHTITAN incorporates innovative hardware-software co-designed solutions, leveraging cutting-edge features like Float8 training and SymmetricMemory to maximize hardware utilization. As a flexible experimental test bed, TORCHTITAN facilitates the curation and comparison of custom recipes for diverse training contexts. By leveraging TORCHTITAN, we developed optimized training recipes for the Llama 3.1 family and provide actionable guidance on selecting and combining distributed training techniques to maximize training efficiency, based on our hands-on experiences. We thoroughly assess TORCHTITAN on the Llama 3.1 family of LLMs, spanning 8 billion to 405 billion parameters, and showcase its exceptional performance, modular composability, and elastic scalability. By stacking training optimizations, we demonstrate accelerations ranging from 65.08% on Llama 3.1 8B at 128 GPU scale (1D), 12.59% on Llama 3.1 70B at 256 GPU scale (2D), to 30% on Llama 3.1 405B at 512 GPU scale (3D) on NVIDIA H100 GPUs over optimized baselines.

    "abstract": "Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations support this ability; however, the conditions under which they are sufficient for the emergence of compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, compositionally structured representations. This provides a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of training data statistics on generalization. We find that these models are limited to functions that assign values to each combination of components seen during training, and then sum up these values (\"conjunction-wise additivity\"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks compositionally structured kernel models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that they can learn in principle, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization (memorization leak and shortcut bias) that arise from biases in the training data. Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work examines how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel backdoor threat attacking the LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation regime, where the adversary controls both the candidate and evaluator model. The backdoored evaluator victimizes benign users by unfairly assigning inflated scores to adversary. A trivial single token backdoor poisoning 1% of the evaluator training data triples the adversary's score with respect to their legitimate score. We systematically categorize levels of data access corresponding to three real-world settings, (1) web poisoning, (2) malicious annotator, and (3) weight poisoning. These regimes reflect a weak to strong escalation of data access that highly correlates with attack severity. Under the weakest assumptions - web poisoning (1), the adversary still induces a 20% score inflation. Likewise, in the (3) weight poisoning regime, the stronger assumptions enable the adversary to inflate their scores from 1.5/5 to 4.9/5. The backdoor threat generalizes across different evaluator architectures, trigger designs, evaluation tasks, and poisoning rates. By poisoning 10% of the evaluator training data, we control toxicity judges (Guardrails) to misclassify toxic prompts as non-toxic 89% of the time, and document reranker judges in RAG to rank the poisoned document first 97% of the time. LLM-as-a-Judge is uniquely positioned at the intersection of ethics and technology, where social implications of mislead model selection and evaluation constrain the available defensive tools. Amidst these challenges, model merging emerges as a principled tool to offset the backdoor, reducing ASR to near 0% whilst maintaining SOTA performance. Model merging's low computational cost and convenient integration into the current LLM Judge training pipeline position it as a promising avenue for backdoor mitigation in the LLM-as-a-Judge setting",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "A decision-making agent, such as a robot, must observe and react to any new task-relevant information that becomes available from its environment. We seek to study a fundamental scientific question: what value does sensory information hold to an agent at various moments in time during the execution of a task? Towards this, we empirically study agents of varying architectures, generated with varying policy synthesis approaches (imitation, RL, model-based control), on diverse robotics tasks. For each robotic agent, we characterize its regret in terms of performance degradation when state observations are withheld from it at various task states for varying lengths of time. We find that sensory information is surprisingly rarely task-critical in many commonly studied task setups. Task characteristics such as stochastic dynamics largely dictate the value of sensory information for a well-trained robot; policy architectures such as planning vs. reactive control generate more nuanced second-order effects. Further, sensing efficiency is curiously correlated with task proficiency: in particular, fully trained high-performing agents are more robust to sensor loss than novice agents early in their training. Overall, our findings characterize the tradeoffs between sensory information and task performance in practical sequential decision making tasks, and pave the way towards the design of more resource-efficient decision-making agents",

However, a key challenge in the field is the lack of transferability between sensors due to design and manufacturing variations, which result in significant differences in tactile signals.

To address this, we introduce a novel method for extracting Sensor-Invariant Tactile Representations (SITR), enabling zero-shot transfer across optical tactile sensors. Our approach utilizes a transformer-based architecture trained on a diverse dataset of simulated sensor designs, allowing it to generalize to new sensors in the real world with minimal calibration.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated superior performance in node classification tasks across diverse applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where minor perturbations can mislead model predictions, poses significant challenges. This study introduces GOttack, a novel adversarial attack framework that exploits the topological structure of graphs to undermine the integrity of GNN predictions systematically. By defining a topology-aware method to manipulate graph orbits, our approach generates adversarial modifications that are both subtle and effective, posing a severe test to the robustness of GNNs. We evaluate the efficacy of GOttack across multiple prominent GNN architectures using standard benchmark datasets. Our results show that GOttack outperforms existing state-of-the-art adversarial techniques and completes training in approximately 55% of the time required by the fastest competing model, achieving the highest average misclassification rate in 155 tasks. This work not only sheds light on the susceptibility of GNNs to structured adversarial attacks but also shows that certain topological patterns may play a significant role in the underlying robustness of the GNNs.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal in revolutionizing customer support and operations by integrating multiple modalities such as text, images, and audio. Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank factorization scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization.

    "title": "Optimizing 4D Gaussians for Dynamic Scene Video from Single Landscape Images",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "To achieve realistic immersion in landscape images, fluids such as water and clouds need to move within the image while revealing new scenes from various camera perspectives. Recently, a field called dynamic scene video has emerged, which combines single image animation with 3D photography. These methods use pseudo 3D space, implicitly represented with Layered Depth Images (LDIs). LDIs separate a single image into depth-based layers, which enables elements like water and clouds to move within the image while revealing new scenes from different camera perspectives. However, as landscapes typically consist of continuous elements, including fluids, the representation of a 3D space separates a landscape image into discrete layers, and it can lead to diminished depth perception and potential distortions depending on camera movement. Furthermore, due to its implicit modeling of 3D space, the output may be limited to videos in the 2D domain, potentially reducing their versatility. In this paper, we propose representing a complete 3D space for dynamic scene video by modeling explicit representations, specifically 4D Gaussians, from a single image. The framework is focused on optimizing 3D Gaussians by generating multi-view images from a single image and creating 3D motion to optimize 4D Gaussians. The most important part of proposed framework is consistent 3D motion estimation, which estimates common motion among multi-view images to bring the motion in 3D space closer to actual motions. As far as we know, this is the first attempt that considers animation while representing a complete 3D space from a single landscape image. Our model demonstrates the ability to provide realistic immersion in various landscape images through diverse experiments and metrics.

A plethora of papers and benchmarks have been introduced to evaluate if current models have been able to develop this key ability of social intelligence. However, all rely on limited datasets with simple patterns that can potentially lead to problematic blind spots in evaluation and an overestimation of model capabilities. We introduce ExploreToM, the first framework to allow large-scale generation of diverse and challenging theory of mind data for robust training and evaluation. Our approach leverages an A* search over a custom domain-specific language to produce complex story structures and novel, diverse, yet plausible scenarios to stress test the limits of LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Llama-3.1-70B and GPT-4o, show accuracies as low as 0% and 9% on ExploreToM-generated data, highlighting the need for more robust theory of mind evaluation. As our generations are a conceptual superset of prior work, fine-tuning on our data yields a 27-point accuracy improvement on the classic ToMi benchmark (Le et al., 2019). ExploreToM also enables uncovering underlying skills and factors missing for models to show theory of mind, such as unreliable state tracking or data imbalances, which may contribute to models' poor performance on benchmarks",

    "title": "Controllable Context Sensitivity and the Knob Behind It",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "When making predictions, a language model must trade off how much it relies on its context vs. its prior knowledge. Choosing how sensitive the model is to its context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at tasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this paper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining whether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To guide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In this task, we first feed the model a context (\"Paris is in England\") and a question (\"Where is Paris?\"); we then instruct the model to either use its prior or contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer for both intents (either \"France\" or \"England\"). When fine-tuned on this task, instruct versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it with high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow down which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear time algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single layer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge. Interestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find that the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model but also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally, we show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly it separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace. These results suggest a single fundamental subspace facilitates how the model chooses between context and prior knowledge",

    "abstract": "Visual perspective taking (VPT) is the ability to perceive and reason about the perspectives of others. It is an essential feature of human intelligence, which develops over the first decade of life and requires an ability to process the 3D structure of visual scenes. A growing number of reports have indicated that deep neural networks (DNNs) become capable of analyzing 3D scenes after training on large image datasets. We investigated if this emergent ability for 3D analysis in DNNs is sufficient for VPT with the 3D perception challenge (3D-PC): a novel benchmark for 3D perception in humans and DNNs. The 3D-PC is comprised of three 3D-analysis tasks posed within natural scene images: (i.) a simple test of object depth order, (ii.) a basic VPT task (VPT-basic), and (iii.) a more challenging version of VPT (VPT-perturb) designed to limit the effectiveness of \"shortcut\" visual strategies. We tested human participants (N=33) and linearly probed or text-prompted over 300 DNNs on the challenge and found that nearly all of the DNNs approached or exceeded human accuracy in analyzing object depth order. Surprisingly, DNN accuracy on this task correlated with their object recognition performance. In contrast, there was an extraordinary gap between DNNs and humans on VPT-basic. Humans were nearly perfect, whereas most DNNs were near chance. Fine-tuning DNNs on VPT-basic brought them close to human performance, but they, unlike humans, dropped back to chance when tested on VPT-perturb. Our challenge demonstrates that the training routines and architectures of today's DNNs are well-suited for learning basic 3D properties of scenes and objects but are ill-suited for reasoning about these properties like humans do. We release our 3D-PC datasets and code to help bridge this gap in 3D perception between humans and machines",

However, there is a lack of evidence that either approach is better than the other, when adequately matched for data. This is primarily because these approaches require data collected in different (but incompatible) formats, meaning that adequately matched data is not available in existing public datasets. To tackle this problem, we release preference annotations (designed for Bradley-Terry training) to complement existing ratings (designed for Regression style training) in the HelpSteer2 dataset. To improve data interpretability, preference annotations are accompanied with human-written justifications. Using this data, we conduct the first head-to-head comparison of Bradley-Terry and Regression models when adequately matched for data. Based on insights derived from such a comparison, we propose a novel approach to combine Bradley-Terry and Regression reward modeling.

An effective method is to learn embeddings for interconnected modalities. For simple behavioral tasks, neural features can be learned based on labels. However, complex behaviors, such as social interactions, require the joint extraction of behavioral and neural characteristics. In this paper, we present an autoencoder (AE) framework, called Shared-AE, which includes a novel regularization term that automatically identifies features shared between neural activity and behavior, while simultaneously capturing the unique private features specific to each modality. We apply Shared-AE to large-scale neural activity recorded across the entire dorsal cortex of the mouse, during two very different behaviors: (i) head-fixed mice performing a self-initiated decision-making task, and (ii) freely-moving social behavior amongst two mice. Our model successfully captures both `shared features', shared across neural and behavioral activity, and `private features', unique to each modality, significantly enhancing our understanding of the alignment between neural activity and complex behaviors.

These bounds apply to any estimator belonging to a class of Lipschitz continuous estimators, irrespective of the specific $f$-divergence loss function employed. The derived bounds are expressed as a product involving the data dimensionality and the expected value of the density ratio raised to the $p$-th power. Notably, the lower bound includes an exponential term that depends on the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, revealing that the $L_p$ error increases significantly as the KL divergence grows when $p > 1$.

However, these methods cannot exploit redundancy in the hidden dimension of the KV tenors. This paper presents a hidden dimension compression approach called Palu, a KV-Cache compression framework that utilizes low-rank projection to reduce inference-time LLM memory usage. Palu decomposes the linear layers into low-rank matrices, caches compressed intermediate states, and reconstructs the full keys and values on the fly. To improve accuracy, compression rate, and efficiency, Palu further encompasses (1) a medium-grained low-rank decomposition scheme, (2) an efficient rank search algorithm, (3) low-rank-aware quantization compatibility enhancements, and (4) an optimized GPU kernel with matrix fusion. Extensive experiments with popular LLMs show that Palu compresses KV-Cache by 50% while maintaining strong accuracy and delivering up to 1.89× speedup on the RoPE-based attention module. When combined with quantization, Palu's inherent quantization-friendly design yields small to negligible extra accuracy degradation while saving additional memory than quantization-only methods and achieving up to 2.91× speedup for the RoPE-based attention. Moreover, it maintains comparable or even better accuracy (up to 1.19 lower perplexity) compared to quantization-only methods.

    "abstract": "In safe offline reinforcement learning, the objective is to develop a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints, utilizing only offline data. Traditional methods often face difficulties in balancing these constraints, leading to either diminished performance or increased safety risks. We address these issues with a novel approach that begins by learning a conservatively safe policy through the use of Conditional Variational Autoencoders, which model the latent safety constraints. Subsequently, we frame this as a Constrained Reward-Return Maximization problem, wherein the policy aims to optimize rewards while complying with the inferred latent safety constraints.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled zero-shot inference, allowing models to solve new tasks without task-specific training. Various adaptation techniques such as prompt engineering, In-Context Learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning can further enhance the model's performance on a downstream task, but they require substantial manual effort to construct effective prompts or labeled examples. In this work, we introduce a joint inference framework for fully unsupervised adaptation, eliminating the need for manual prompt engineering and labeled examples. Unlike zero-shot inference, which makes independent predictions, the joint inference makes predictions simultaneously for all inputs in a given task. Since direct joint inference involves computationally expensive optimization, we develop efficient approximation techniques, leading to two unsupervised adaptation methods: unsupervised fine-tuning and unsupervised ICL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across diverse tasks and models, including language-only Llama-3.1 on natural language processing tasks, reasoning-oriented Qwen2.5-Math on grade school math problems, vision-language OpenFlamingo on vision tasks, and the API-only access GPT-4o model on massive multi-discipline tasks. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements over the standard zero-shot approach, including 39% absolute improvement on the challenging GSM8K math reasoning dataset. Remarkably, despite being fully unsupervised, our framework often performs on par with supervised approaches that rely on ground truth labels",

While existing studies have utilized LLMs with external feedback mechanisms or in controlled environments for planning, these approaches often involve substantial computational and development resources due to the requirement for careful design and iterative backprompting. Moreover, even the most advanced LLMs like GPT-4 struggle to match human performance on standard planning benchmarks, such as the Blocksworld, without additional support. This paper investigates whether LLMs can independently generate long-horizon plans that rival human baselines.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Machine learning models routinely automate decisions in applications like lending and hiring. In such settings, consumer protection rules require companies that deploy models to explain predictions to decision subjects. These rules are motivated, in part, by the belief that explanations can promote *recourse* by revealing information that individuals can use to contest or improve their outcomes. In practice, many companies comply with these rules by providing individuals with a list of the most important features for their prediction, which they identify based on feature importance scores from feature attribution methods such as SHAP or LIME. In this work, we show how these practices can undermine consumers by highlighting features that would not lead to an improved outcome and by explaining predictions that cannot be changed. We propose to address these issues by highlighting features based on their *responsiveness score*—i.e., the probability that an individual can attain a target prediction by changing a specific feature. We develop efficient methods to compute responsiveness scores for any model and any dataset. We conduct an extensive empirical study on the responsiveness of explanations in lending. Our results show that standard practices in consumer finance can backfire by presenting consumers with *reasons without recourse*, and demonstrate how our approach improves consumer protection by highlighting responsive features and identifying fixed predictions",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Generating realistic 3D human-human interactions from textual descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing approaches, typically based on diffusion models, often produce results lacking realism and fidelity. In this work, we introduce *InterMask*, a novel framework for generating human interactions using collaborative masked modeling in discrete space. InterMask first employs a VQ-VAE to transform each motion sequence into a 2D discrete motion token map. Unlike traditional 1D VQ token maps, it better preserves fine-grained spatio-temporal details and promotes *spatial awareness* within each token. Building on this representation, InterMask utilizes a generative masked modeling framework to collaboratively model the tokens of two interacting individuals. This is achieved by employing a transformer architecture specifically designed to capture complex spatio-temporal inter-dependencies. During training, it randomly masks the motion tokens of both individuals and learns to predict them. For inference, starting from fully masked sequences, it progressively fills in the tokens for both individuals. With its enhanced motion representation, dedicated architecture, and effective learning strategy, InterMask achieves state-of-the-art results, producing high-fidelity and diverse human interactions. It outperforms previous methods, achieving an FID of $5.154$ (vs $5.535$ of in2IN) on the InterHuman dataset and $0.399$ (vs $5.207$ of InterGen) on the InterX dataset. Additionally, InterMask seamlessly supports reaction generation without the need for model redesign or fine-tuning",

We argue that the Markovian property limits the model's ability to fully utilize the generation trajectory, leading to inefficiencies during training and inference. In this paper, we propose DART, a transformer-based model that unifies autoregressive (AR) and diffusion within a non-Markovian framework. DART iteratively denoises image patches spatially and spectrally using an AR model that has the same architecture as standard language models. DART does not rely on image quantization, which enables more effective image modeling while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, DART seamlessly trains with both text and image data in a unified model. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance on class-conditioned and text-to-image generation tasks, offering a scalable, efficient alternative to traditional diffusion models.

However, previous multi-objective optimization methods often focus on a few objectives and cannot scale to many objectives that outnumber the solutions, leading to either subpar performance or ignored objectives. We introduce ''Many-objective multi-solution Transport (MosT)'', a framework that finds multiple diverse solutions in the Pareto front of many objectives. Our insight is to seek multiple solutions, each performing as a domain expert and focusing on a specific subset of objectives while collectively covering all of them. MosT formulates the problem as a bi-level optimization of weighted objectives for each solution, where the weights are defined by an optimal transport between objectives and solutions. Our algorithm ensures convergence to Pareto stationary solutions for complementary subsets of objectives. On a range of applications in federated learning, multi-task learning, and mixture-of-prompt learning for LLMs, MosT distinctly outperforms strong baselines, delivering high-quality, diverse solutions that profile the entire Pareto frontier, thus ensuring balanced trade-offs across many objectives",

However, subsequent fine-tuning or deployment modifications may alter these behaviors in unintended ways. We present an efficient statistical test to tackle Behavioral Shift Auditing (BSA) in LMs, which we define as detecting distribution shifts in qualitative properties of the output distributions of LMs. Our test compares model generations from a baseline model to those of the model under scrutiny and provides theoretical guarantees for change detection while controlling false positives. The test features a configurable tolerance parameter that adjusts sensitivity to behavioral changes for different use cases.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, referring to the non-factual information in generated content, despite their superior capacities across tasks. Meanwhile, knowledge editing has been developed as a new popular paradigm to correct erroneous factual knowledge encoded in LLMs with the advantage of avoiding retraining from scratch. However, a common issue of existing evaluation datasets for knowledge editing is that they do not ensure that LLMs actually generate hallucinated answers to the evaluation questions before editing. When LLMs are evaluated on such datasets after being edited by different techniques, it is hard to directly adopt the performance to assess the effectiveness of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations. Thus, the fundamental question remains insufficiently validated: Can knowledge editing really correct hallucinations in LLMs? We proposed HalluEditBench to holistically benchmark knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations. First, we rigorously construct a massive hallucination dataset with 9 domains, 26 topics and more than 6,000 hallucinations. Then, we assess the performance of knowledge editing methods in a holistic way on five dimensions including Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness. Through HalluEditBench, we have provided new insights into the potentials and limitations of different knowledge editing methods in correcting hallucinations, which could inspire future improvements and facilitate progress in the field of knowledge editing",

These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets.

We first formalize the problem of data selection with a cost-aware utility function, and model the data selection problem as trading off initial-selection cost for training gain. We run a comprehensive sweep of experiments across multiple tasks, varying compute budget by scaling finetuning tokens, model sizes, and data selection compute. Interestingly we find that many powerful data selection methods are almost never compute-optimal, and that cheaper data selection alternatives dominate both from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective—the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation—strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with `gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases",

Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of learning-based heuristics, yet these approaches often struggle with limited search capabilities. We introduce Explore-and-Exploit GNN ($X^2$GNN, pronounced x-squared GNN), a novel unsupervised neural framework that combines exploration and exploitation for combinatorial search optimization: i) Exploration - $X^2$GNN generates multiple solutions simultaneously, promoting diversity in the search space; (ii) Exploitation - $X^2$GNN employs neural stochastic iterative refinement to exploit partial existing solutions, guiding the search toward promising regions and helping escape local optima. By balancing exploration and exploitation, $X^2$GNN achieves superior performance and generalization on several graph CO problems including Max Cut, Max Independent Set, and Max Clique. Notably, for large Max Clique problems, $X^2$GNN consistently generates solutions within 1.2\\% of optimality, while other state-of-the-art learning-based approaches struggle to reach within 22\\% of optimal. Moreover, $X^2$GNN consistently generates better solutions than Gurobi on large graphs for all three problems under reasonable time budgets. Furthermore, $X^2$GNN exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities. For the Maximum Independent Set problem, $X^2$GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods even when trained on smaller or out-of-distribution graphs compared to the test set.

Despite their emerging successes, the performance of LLM agents in decision-making has not been fully investigated through quantitative metrics, especially in the multi-agent setting when they interact with each other, a typical scenario in real-world LLM-agent applications. To better understand the limits of LLM agents in these interactive environments, we propose to study their interactions in benchmark decision-making settings in online learning and game theory, through the performance metric of regret. We first empirically study the no-regret behaviors of LLMs in canonical non-stochastic online learning problems, as well as the emergence of equilibria when LLM agents interact through playing repeated games. We then provide some theoretical insights into the no-regret behaviors of LLM agents, under certain assumptions on the supervised pre-training and the rationality model of human decision-makers who generate the data. Notably, we also identify (simple) cases where advanced LLMs such as GPT-4 fail to be no-regret. To further promote the no-regret behaviors, we propose a novel unsupervised training loss of regret-loss, which, in contrast to the supervised pre-training loss, does not require the labels of (optimal) actions. Finally, we establish the statistical guarantee of generalization bound for regret-loss minimization, and more importantly, the optimization guarantee that minimizing such a loss may automatically lead to known no-regret learning algorithms, when single-layer self-attention models are used. Our further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our regret-loss, especially in addressing the above \"regrettable\" cases",

While deep learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open, large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., Rotation X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis.

EDQ makes use of recursion for the Q-function that is compatible with flexible sequence models, such as transformers. EDQ provides accurate estimates under standard assumptions.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Federated learning claims to enable collaborative model training among multiple clients with data privacy by transmitting gradient updates instead of the actual client data. However, recent studies have shown the client privacy is still at risk due to the, so called, gradient inversion attacks which can precisely reconstruct clients' text and image data from the shared gradient updates. While these attacks demonstrate severe privacy risks for certain domains and architectures, the vulnerability of other commonly-used data types, such as graph-structured data, remain under-explored. To bridge this gap, we present GRAIN, the first exact gradient inversion attack on graph data in the honest-but-curious setting that recovers both the structure of the graph and the associated node features. Concretely, we focus on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) -- two of the most widely used frameworks for learning on graphs. Our method first utilizes the low-rank structure of GNN gradients to efficiently reconstruct and filter the client subgraphs which are then joined to complete the input graph. We evaluate our approach on molecular, citation, and social network datasets using our novel metric. We show that GRAIN reconstructs up to 80\\% of all graphs exactly, significantly outperforming the baseline, which achieves up to 20\\% correctly positioned nodes",

In this paper, we use an LLM as a policy that generates lines of code and then join these lines of code to let the LLM implicitly estimate the value of each of these lines in its next iteration. We further guide the policy and value estimation by executing each line and annotating it with its results on the given examples. This allows us to search for programs within a single (expanding) prompt until a sound program is found, by letting the policy reason in both the syntactic (code) and semantic (execution) space. We evaluate within-prompt search on straight-line Python code generation using five benchmarks across different domains (strings, lists, and arbitrary Python programming problems). We show that the model uses the execution results to guide the search and that within-prompt search performs well at low token budgets. We also analyze how the model behaves as a policy and value, show that it can parallelize the search, and that it can implicitly backtrack over earlier generations",

    "abstract": "The quest for robust and generalizable machine learning models has driven recent interest in exploiting symmetries through equivariant neural networks. In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models. Finally, we showcase LieLAC's efficacy on tasks of invariant image classification and Lie point symmetry equivariant neural PDE solvers using pre-trained models",

Traditional algorithms require retraining from scratch when new variables are introduced, making them impractical for dynamic or large-scale applications. In this paper, we propose an extendable structure learning strategy that efficiently incorporates a new variable $Y$ into an existing Bayesian network graph $\\mathcal{G}$ over variables $\\mathcal{X}$, resulting in an updated P-map graph $\\bar{\\mathcal{G}}$ on $\\bar{\\mathcal{X}} = \\mathcal{X} \\cup \\{Y\\}$. By leveraging the information encoded in $\\mathcal{G}$, our method significantly reduces computational overhead compared to learning $\\bar{\\mathcal{G}}$ from scratch. Empirical evaluations demonstrate runtime reductions of up to 1300x without compromising accuracy. Building on this approach, we introduce a novel iterative paradigm for structure learning over $\\mathcal{X}$. Starting with a small subset $\\mathcal{U} \\subset \\mathcal{X}$, we iteratively add the remaining variables using our extendable algorithms to construct a P-map graph over the full set. This method offers runtime advantages comparable to common algorithms while maintaining similar accuracy.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) traditionally employ a message-passing mechanism that resembles diffusion over undirected graphs, which often leads to homogenization of node features and reduced discriminative power in tasks such as node classification. Our key insight for addressing this limitation is to assign fuzzy edge directions---that can vary continuously from node $i$ pointing to node $j$ to vice versa---to the edges of a graph so that features can preferentially flow in one direction between nodes to enable long-range information transmission across the graph. We also introduce a novel complex-valued Laplacian for directed graphs with fuzzy edges where the real and imaginary parts represent information flow in opposite directions. Using this Laplacian, we propose a general framework, called Continuous Edge Direction (CoED) GNN, for learning on graphs with fuzzy edges and prove its expressivity limits using a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) graph isomorphism test for directed graphs with fuzzy edges. Our architecture aggregates neighbor features scaled by the learned edge directions and processes the aggregated messages from in-neighbors and out-neighbors separately alongside the self-features of the nodes. Since continuous edge directions are differentiable, they can be learned jointly with the GNN weights via gradient-based optimization. CoED GNN is particularly well-suited for graph ensemble data where the graph structure remains fixed but multiple realizations of node features are available, such as in gene regulatory networks, web connectivity graphs, and power grids. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real graph ensemble datasets that learning continuous edge directions significantly improves performance both for undirected and directed graphs compared with existing methods",

    "abstract": "Indexing is an important step towards strong performance in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, existing methods organize data based on either semantic similarity (similarity) or related information (relatedness), but do not cover both perspectives comprehensively. Our analysis reveals that modeling only one perspective results in insufficient knowledge synthesis, leading to suboptimal performance on complex tasks requiring multihop reasoning. In this paper, we propose SiReRAG, a novel RAG indexing approach that explicitly considers both similar and related information. On the similarity side, we follow existing work and explore some variances to construct a similarity tree based on recursive summarization. On the relatedness side, SiReRAG extracts propositions and entities from texts, groups propositions via shared entities, and generates recursive summaries to construct a relatedness tree. We index and flatten both similarity and relatedness trees into a unified retrieval pool. Our experiments demonstrate that SiReRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on three multihop datasets (MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA), with an average 1.9% improvement in F1 scores. As a reasonably efficient solution, SiReRAG enhances existing reranking methods significantly, with up to 7.8% improvement in average F1 scores.

Currently, insightful theories still rely on assumptions including the linearity of the network computations, unstructured input data and architectural constraints such as infinite width or a single hidden layer. To begin to address this gap we establish an equivalence between ReLU networks and Gated Deep Linear Networks, and use their greater tractability to derive dynamics of learning. We then consider multiple variants of a core task reminiscent of multi-task learning or contextual control which requires both feature learning and nonlinearity. We make explicit that, for these tasks, the ReLU networks possess an inductive bias towards latent representations which are *not* strictly modular or disentangled but are still highly structured and reusable between contexts. This effect is amplified with the addition of more contexts and hidden layers. Thus, we take a step towards a theory of feature learning in finite ReLU networks and shed light on how structured mixed-selective latent representations can emerge due to a bias for node-reuse and learning speed",

For such tasks, we introduce **Generative Active Task Elicitation (GATE)**, a method for using *LMs themselves* to guide the task specification process. GATE is a learning framework in which models elicit and infer human preferences through free-form, language-based interaction with users. We identify prototypical challenges that users face when specifying preferences, and design three preference modeling tasks to study these challenges: content recommendation, moral reasoning, and email validation. In preregistered experiments, we show that LMs that learn to perform these tasks using GATE (by interactively querying users with open-ended questions) obtain preference specifications that are more informative than user-written prompts or examples. GATE matches existing task specification methods in the moral reasoning task, and significantly outperforms them in the content recommendation and email validation tasks. Users additionally report that interactive task elicitation requires less effort than prompting or example labeling and surfaces considerations that they did not anticipate on their own. Our findings suggest that LM-driven elicitation can be a powerful tool for aligning models to complex human preferences and values",

    "abstract": "World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses it to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the pretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a pretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such initialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the online interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze the performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the mismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to distribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on performance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the choice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these effects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning method, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies the mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven finetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed using efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging CARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the finetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in autonomous driving systems",

    "abstract": "Discovering a unique causal structure is difficult due to both inherent identifiability issues, and the consequences of finite data.

Finding an accurate approximation to this posterior is challenging, due to the large number of possible causal graphs, as well as the difficulty in the subproblem of finding posteriors over the functional relationships of the causal edges. Recent works have used Bayesian meta learning to view the problem of posterior estimation as a supervised learning task. Yet, these methods are limited as they cannot reliably sample from the posterior over causal structures and fail to encode key properties of the posterior, such as correlation between edges and permutation equivariance with respect to nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a Bayesian meta learning model that allows for sampling causal structures from the posterior and encodes these key properties. We compare our meta-Bayesian causal discovery against existing Bayesian causal discovery methods, demonstrating the advantages of directly learning a posterior over causal structure",

    "abstract": "As video language models (VLMs) gain more applications in various scenarios, the need for robust and scalable evaluation of their performance becomes increasingly critical. The traditional human expert-based evaluation of VLMs has limitations in consistency and scalability, which sparked interest in automatic methods such as employing VLMs to evaluate VLMs. However, the reliability of VLMs as judges remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on a single VLM as the evaluator. However, this approach can be unreliable or biased because such a model may lack the ability to fully understand the content and may have inherent biases, ultimately compromising evaluation reliability. A remedy is to apply the principle of collective thoughts, aggregating evaluations from multiple VLMs to enhance reliability. This study investigates the efficacy of such approaches, particularly when the pool of judges includes both reliable and unreliable models. Our findings reveal that incorporating collective judgments from such a mixed pool does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the final evaluation. The inclusion of less reliable judges can introduce noise, undermining the overall reliability of the outcomes. To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we fine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved understanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable. These findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and highlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the reliability of individual models.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new single-loop DBO algorithm called diminishing quadratically-regularized bilevel decentralized optimization (DUET), which eliminates the need for LLSC by introducing a diminishing quadratic regularization to the lower-level (LL) objective. We show that DUET achieves an iteration complexity of $O(1/T^{1-5p-\\frac{11}{4}\\tau})$ for approximate KKT-stationary point convergence under relaxed assumptions, where $p$ and $\\tau $ are control parameters for LL learning rate and averaging, respectively. In addition, our DUET algorithm incorporates gradient tracking to address data heterogeneity, a key challenge in DBO settings.

Current leading one-shot pruning methods minimize layer-wise least squares reconstruction error which does not take into account deeper network representations. We propose to optimize a more global reconstruction objective. This objective accounts for nonlinear activations deep in the network to obtain a better proxy for the network loss. This nonlinear objective leads to a more challenging optimization problem---we demonstrate it can be solved efficiently using a specialized second-order optimization framework. A key innovation of our framework is the use of Hessian-free optimization to compute exact Newton descent steps without needing to compute or store the full Hessian matrix. A distinct advantage of SNOWS is that it can be readily applied on top of any sparse mask derived from prior methods, readjusting their weights to preserve deep feature representations. SNOWS obtains state-of-the-art results on various one-shot pruning benchmarks including residual networks and Vision Transformers (ViT/B-16 and ViT/L-16, 86m and 304m parameters respectively).

These models can be guided in two ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition, or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.

    "title": "Efficient Diffusion Transformer Policies with Mixture of Expert Denoisers for Multitask Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Diffusion Policies have become widely used in Imitation Learning, offering several appealing properties, such as generating multimodal and discontinuous behavior. As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities, their computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws. Therefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a computational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising Experts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current state-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling parameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned routing, reducing both active parameters by 40\\% and inference costs by 90\\% via expert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with noise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising across different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on 134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and LIBERO). Notably, by pretraining MoDE on diverse robotics data, we achieve 4.01 on CALVIN ABC and 0.95 on LIBERO-90. It surpasses both CNN-based and Transformer Diffusion Policies by an average of $57\\%$ across 4 benchmarks, while using 90\\% fewer FLOPs and fewer active parameters compared to default Diffusion Transformer architectures. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablations on MoDE's components, providing insights for designing efficient and scalable Transformer architectures for Diffusion Policies.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) exhibit growing promise in addressing Earth representation challenges, ranging from emissions monitoring to climate modeling. However, existing methods disproportionately prioritize global average performance, whereas practitioners require fine-grained insights to understand biases and variations in these models. To bridge this gap, we introduce FAIR-Earth: a first-of-its-kind dataset explicitly crafted to challenge and examine inequities in Earth representations. FAIR-Earth comprises various high-resolution Earth signals, and uniquely aggregates extensive metadata along stratifications like landmass size and population density to assess the fairness of models. Evaluating state-of-the-art INRs across the various modalities of FAIR-Earth, we uncover striking performance disparities. Certain subgroups, especially those associated with high-frequency signals (e.g., islands, coastlines), are consistently poorly modeled by existing methods. In response, we propose spherical wavelet encodings, building on previous spatial encoding research for INRs. Leveraging the multi-resolution analysis capabilities of wavelets, our encodings yield more consistent performance over various scales and locations, offering more accurate and robust representations of the biased subgroups. These open-source contributions represent a crucial step towards facilitating the equitable assessment and deployment of implicit Earth representations",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "**InvestESG** is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. The benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source versions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and hardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in mitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs",

    "abstract": "Control policies that can achieve high task performance and satisfy safety constraints are desirable for any system, including multi-agent systems (MAS). One promising technique for ensuring the safety of MAS is distributed control barrier functions (CBF). However, it is difficult to design distributed CBF-based policies for MAS that can tackle unknown discrete-time dynamics, partial observability, changing neighborhoods, and input constraints, especially when a distributed high-performance nominal policy that can achieve the task is unavailable. To tackle these challenges, we propose **DGPPO**, a new framework that *simultaneously* learns both a *discrete* graph CBF which handles neighborhood changes and input constraints, and a distributed high-performance safe policy for MAS with unknown discrete-time dynamics. We empirically validate our claims on a suite of multi-agent tasks spanning three different simulation engines. The results suggest that, compared with existing methods, our DGPPO framework obtains policies that achieve high task performance (matching baselines that ignore the safety constraints), and high safety rates (matching the most conservative baselines), with a *constant* set of hyperparameters across all environments",

Steering LLMs away from generic output is possible through supervised finetuning or RLHF, but requires prohibitively large datasets for new ad-hoc tasks. We argue that it is instead possible to align an LLM to a specific setting by leveraging a very small number ($<10$) of demonstrations as feedback. Our method, Demonstration ITerated Task Optimization (DITTO), directly aligns language model outputs to a user's demonstrated behaviors. Derived using ideas from online imitation learning, DITTO cheaply generates online comparison data by treating users' demonstrations as preferred over output from the LLM and its intermediate checkpoints. We evaluate DITTO's ability to learn fine-grained style and task alignment across domains such as news articles, emails, and blog posts. Additionally, we conduct a user study soliciting a range of demonstrations from participants ($N=16$). Across our benchmarks and user study, we find that win-rates for DITTO outperform few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and other self-play methods by an average of 19\\% points.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) can respond to queries about images in many languages. However, beyond language, culture affects how we see things. For example, individuals from Western cultures focus more on the central figure in an image while individuals from East Asian cultures attend more to scene context (Nisbett 2001). In this work, we characterize the Western bias of VLMs in image understanding and investigate the role that language plays in this disparity. We evaluate VLMs across subjective and objective visual tasks with culturally diverse images and annotations. We find that VLMs perform better on the Western split than on the East Asian split of each task. Through controlled experimentation, we trace one source of this bias in image understanding to the lack of diversity in language model construction. While inference in a language nearer to a culture can lead to reductions in bias, we show it is much more effective when that language was well-represented during text-only pre-training. Interestingly, this yields bias reductions even when prompting in English. Our work highlights the importance of richer representation of all languages in building equitable VLMs",

Motivated by recent work in machine learning and the intuitive observation that human experts continue to learn after mastery, we hypothesize that task-specific representation learning in cortex can continue, even when behavior saturates. In a novel reanalysis of recently published neural data, we find evidence for such learning in posterior piriform cortex of mice following continued training on a task, long after behavior saturates at near-ceiling performance (\"overtraining\"). We demonstrate that class representations in cortex continue to separate during overtraining, so that examples that were incorrectly classified at the beginning of overtraining can abruptly be correctly classified later on, despite no changes in behavior during that time. We hypothesize this hidden learning takes the form of approximate margin maximization; we validate this and other predictions in the neural data, as well as build and interpret a simple synthetic model that recapitulates these phenomena. We conclude by demonstrating how this model of late-time feature learning implies an explanation for the empirical puzzle of overtraining reversal in animal learning, where task-specific representations are more robust to particular task changes because the learned features can be reused",

The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties",

GEM broadens the scenarios where we can benchmark LLM generation performance-from traditional ones, like machine translation and summarization, where gold standard references are readily available, to subjective tasks without clear gold standards, such as academic peer review. GEM uses a generative model to estimate mutual information between candidate and reference responses, without requiring the reference to be a gold standard. In experiments on two human-annotated datasets, GEM demonstrates competitive correlations with human scores compared to the state-of-the-art GPT-4o Examiner, and outperforms all other baselines. Additionally, GEM is more robust against strategic manipulation, such as rephrasing or elongation, which can artificially inflate scores under a GPT-4o Examiner. We also present GRE-bench (Generating Review Evaluation Benchmark) which evaluates LLMs based on how well they can generate high-quality peer reviews for academic research papers. Because GRE-bench is based upon GEM, it inherits its robustness properties. Additionally, GRE-bench circumvents data contamination problems (or data leakage) by using the continuous influx of new open-access research papers and peer reviews each year.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Two-stage adaptive robust optimization (ARO) is a powerful approach for planning under uncertainty, balancing first-stage decisions with recourse decisions made after uncertainty is realized. To account for uncertainty, modelers typically define a simple uncertainty set over which potential outcomes are considered. However, classical methods for defining these sets unintentionally capture a wide range of unrealistic outcomes, resulting in overly-conservative and costly planning in anticipation of unlikely contingencies. In this work, we introduce AGRO, a solution algorithm that performs adversarial generation for two-stage adaptive robust optimization using a variational autoencoder. AGRO generates high-dimensional contingencies that are simultaneously adversarial and realistic, improving the robustness of first-stage decisions at a lower planning cost than standard methods. To ensure generated contingencies lie in high-density regions of the uncertainty distribution, AGRO defines a tight uncertainty set as the image of \"latent\" uncertainty sets under the VAE decoding transformation. Projected gradient ascent is then used to maximize recourse costs over the latent uncertainty sets by leveraging differentiable optimization methods. We demonstrate the cost-efficiency of AGRO by applying it to both a synthetic production-distribution problem and a real-world power system expansion setting. We show that AGRO outperforms the standard column-and-constraint algorithm by up to 1.8% in production-distribution planning and up to 8% in power system expansion",

    "abstract": "The Transformer architecture is widely deployed in many popular and impactful Large Language Models. At its core is the attention mechanism for calculating correlations between pairs of tokens. Performing an attention computation takes quadratic time in the input size, and had become the time bottleneck for transformer operations. In order to circumvent this, researchers have used a variety of approaches, including designing heuristic algorithms for performing attention computations faster, and proposing alternatives to the attention mechanism which can be computed more quickly. For instance, state space models such as Mamba were designed to replace attention with an almost linear time alternative. In this paper, we prove that any such approach cannot perform important tasks that Transformer is able to perform (assuming a popular conjecture from fine-grained complexity theory). We focus on document similarity tasks, where one is given as input many documents and would like to find a pair which is (approximately) the most similar. We prove that Transformer is able to perform this task, and we prove that this task cannot be performed in truly subquadratic time by any algorithm. Thus, any model which can be evaluated in subquadratic time – whether because of subquadratic-time heuristics for attention, faster attention replacements like Mamba, or any other reason – cannot perform this task. In other words, in order to perform tasks that (implicitly or explicitly) involve document similarity, one may as well use Transformer and cannot avoid its quadratic running time",

However, current tree induction methods often face limitations such as suboptimal solutions from greedy methods or prohibitive computational costs and limited applicability of exact optimization approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary optimization method for decision tree induction based on genetic programming (GP). Our key innovation is the integration of semantic priors and domain-specific knowledge about the search space into the optimization algorithm. To this end, we introduce $\\texttt{LLEGO}$, a framework that incorporates semantic priors into genetic search operators through the use of Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby enhancing search efficiency and targeting regions of the search space that yield decision trees with superior generalization performance. This is operationalized through novel genetic operators that work with structured natural language prompts, effectively utilizing LLMs as conditional generative models and sources of semantic knowledge. Specifically, we introduce $\\textit{fitness-guided}$ crossover to exploit high-performing regions, and $\\textit{diversity-guided}$ mutation for efficient global exploration of the search space. These operators are controlled by corresponding hyperparameters that enable a more nuanced balance between exploration and exploitation across the search space.

This is often true in practice due to differences in observation space and action space expressiveness (e.g. perceptual or morphological differences between robots and humans). Given the learner must make some mistakes in the misspecified setting, interaction with the environment is fundamentally required to figure out which mistakes are particularly costly and lead to compounding errors. However, given the computational cost and safety concerns inherent in interaction, we'd like to perform as little of it as possible while ensuring we've learned a strong policy. Accordingly, prior work has proposed a flavor of efficient inverse reinforcement learning algorithms that merely perform a computationally efficient local search procedure with strong guarantees in the realizable setting. We first prove that under a novel structural condition we term reward-agnostic policy completeness, these sorts of local-search based IRL algorithms are able to avoid compounding errors. We then consider the question of where we should perform local search in the first place, given the learner may not be able to \"walk on a tightrope\" as well as the expert in the misspecified setting. We prove that in the misspecified setting, it is beneficial to broaden the set of states on which local search is performed to include those reachable by good policies the learner can actually play. We then experimentally explore a variety of sources of misspecification and how offline data can be used to effectively broaden where we perform local search from",

    "title": "A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest to leverage recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel class of regularization functions, called Cauchy–Schwarz (CS) regularizers, which can be designed to induce a wide range of properties in solution vectors of optimization problems. To demonstrate the versatility of CS regularizers, we derive regularization functions that promote discrete-valued vectors, eigenvectors of a given matrix, and orthogonal matrices. The resulting CS regularizers are simple, differentiable, and can be free of spurious stationary points, making them suitable for gradient-based solvers and large-scale optimization problems. In addition, CS regularizers automatically adapt to the appropriate scale, which is, for example, beneficial when discretizing the weights of neural networks. To demonstrate the efficacy of CS regularizers, we provide results for solving underdetermined systems of linear equations and weight quantization in neural networks. Furthermore, we discuss specializations, variations, and generalizations, which lead to an even broader class of new and possibly more powerful regularizers",

    "title": "Adversarially Robust Anomaly Detection through Spurious Negative Pair Mitigation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of existing detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as autonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which assumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples, making the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing. Additionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters difficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without access to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD should promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and anomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To address these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived from normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with contrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both inter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative pairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss for achieving robust AD. Spurious negative pairs are those that should be mapped closely but are erroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction of inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious negative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to strengthen inter-group perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate our superior performance in both clean and adversarial scenarios, with a 26.1% improvement in robust detection across various challenging benchmark datasets",

    "abstract": "Large general purpose pre-trained models have revolutionized computer vision and natural language understanding. However, the development of general purpose pre-trained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) lags behind other domains due to the lack of suitable generalist node representations. Existing GNN architectures are often tailored to specific task orders, such as node-level, link-level, or higher-order tasks, because different tasks require distinct permutation symmetries, which are difficult to reconcile within a single model. In this paper, we propose _holographic node representations_, a new blueprint for node representations capable of solving tasks of any order. Holographic node representations have two key components: (1) a task-agnostic expansion map, which produces highly expressive, high-dimensional embeddings, free from node-permutation symmetries, to be fed into (2) a reduction map that carefully reintroduces the relevant permutation symmetries to produce low-dimensional, task-specific embeddings. We show that well-constructed expansion maps enable simple and efficient reduction maps, which can be adapted for any task order. Empirical results show that holographic node representations can be effectively pre-trained and reused across tasks of varying orders, yielding up to 100% relative performance improvement, including in cases where prior methods fail entirely",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fundamental mathematical constants appear in nearly every field of science, from physics to biology. Formulas that connect different constants often bring great insight by hinting at connections between previously disparate fields. Discoveries of such relations, however, have remained scarce events, relying on sporadic strokes of creativity by human mathematicians. Recent developments of algorithms for automated conjecture generation have accelerated the discovery of formulas for specific constants. Yet, the discovery of connections between constants has not been addressed. In this paper, we present the first library dedicated to mathematical constants and their interrelations. This library can serve as a central repository of knowledge for scientists from different areas, and as a collaborative platform for development of new algorithms. The library is based on a new representation that we propose for organizing the formulas of mathematical constants: a hypergraph, with each node representing a constant and each edge representing a formula. Using this representation, we propose and demonstrate a systematic approach for automatically enriching this library using PSLQ, an integer relation algorithm based on QR decomposition and lattice construction. During its development and testing, our strategy led to the discovery of 75 previously unknown connections between constants, including a new formula for the `first continued fraction' constant $C_1$, novel formulas for natural logarithms, and new formulas connecting $\\pi$ and $e$. The latter formulas generalize a century-old relation between $\\pi$ and $e$ by Ramanujan, which until now was considered a singular formula and is now found to be part of a broader mathematical structure. The code supporting this library is a public, open-source API that can serve researchers in experimental mathematics and other fields of science",

    "title": "HELMET: How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Many benchmarks exist for evaluating long-context language models (LCLMs), yet developers often rely on synthetic tasks such as needle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) or an arbitrary subset of tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks reflect the diverse downstream applications of LCLMs, and such inconsistencies further complicate model comparison. We investigate the underlying reasons behind these practices and find that existing benchmarks often provide noisy signals due to limited coverage of applications, insufficient context lengths, unreliable metrics, and incompatibility with base models. In this work, we introduce HELMET (How to Evaluate Long-context Models Effectively and Thoroughly), a comprehensive benchmark encompassing seven diverse, application-centric categories. We also address several issues in previous benchmarks by adding controllable lengths up to 128K tokens, model-based evaluation for reliable metrics, and few-shot prompting for robustly evaluating base models. Consequently, we demonstrate that HELMET offers more reliable and consistent rankings of frontier LCLMs. Through a comprehensive study of 59 LCLMs, we find that (1) synthetic tasks like NIAH do not reliably predict downstream performance; (2) the diverse categories in HELMET exhibit distinct trends and low correlations with each other; and (3) while most LCLMs achieve perfect NIAH scores, open-source models significantly lag behind closed ones when tasks require full-context reasoning or following complex instructions---the gap widens as length increases. Finally, we recommend using our RAG tasks for fast model development, as they are easy to run and better predict other downstream performance; ultimately, we advocate for a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Frontier AI systems are making transformative impacts across society, but such benefits are not without costs: models trained on web-scale datasets containing personal and private data raise profound concerns about data privacy and security. Language models are trained on extensive corpora including potentially sensitive or proprietary information, and the risk of data leakage, where the model response reveals pieces of such information, remains inadequately understood. Prior work has investigated that sequence complexity and the number of repetitions are the primary drivers of memorization. In this work, we examine the most vulnerable class of data: highly complex sequences that are presented only once during training. These sequences often contain the most sensitive information and pose considerable risk if memorized. By analyzing the progression of memorization for these sequences throughout training, we uncover a striking observation: many memorized sequences persist in the model's memory, exhibiting resistance to catastrophic forgetting even after just one encounter. Surprisingly, these sequences may not appear memorized immediately after their first exposure but can later be \"uncovered\" during training, even in the absence of subsequent exposures - a phenomenon we call \"latent memorization.\" Latent memorization presents a serious challenge for data privacy, as sequences that seem hidden at the final checkpoint of a model may still be easily recoverable. We demonstrate how these hidden sequences can be revealed through random weight perturbations, and we introduce a diagnostic test based on cross-entropy loss to accurately identify latent memorized sequences",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory -- the ability to recall specific events grounded in time and space -- is a cornerstone of human cognition, enabling not only coherent storytelling, but also planning and decision-making. Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) lack a robust mechanism for episodic memory: we argue that integrating episodic memory capabilities into LLM is essential for advancing AI towards human-like cognition, increasing their potential to reason consistently and ground their output in real-world episodic events, hence avoiding confabulations. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework to model and evaluate LLM episodic memory capabilities. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we develop a structured approach to represent episodic events, encapsulating temporal and spatial contexts, involved entities, and detailed descriptions. We synthesize a unique episodic memory benchmark, free from contamination, and release open source code and datasets to assess LLM performance across various recall and episodic reasoning tasks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4 and Claude variants, Llama 3.1, and o1-mini, reveals that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with episodic memory tasks, particularly when dealing with multiple related events or complex spatio-temporal relationships -- even in contexts as short as 10k-100k tokens",

    "abstract": "An increasing interest in learning to forecast for time-series of high-dimensional observations is the ability to adapt to systems with diverse underlying dynamics. Access to observations that define a stationary distribution of these systems is often unattainable, as the underlying dynamics may change over time. Naively training or retraining models at each shift may lead to catastrophic forgetting about previously-seen systems. We present a new continual meta-learning (CML) framework to realize continual slow-and fast adaptation of latent dynamics (CoSFan). We leverage a feed-forward meta-model to infer *what* the current system is and *how* to adapt a latent dynamics function to it, enabling *fast adaptation* to specific dynamics. We then develop novel strategies to automatically detect *when* a shift of data distribution occurs, with which to identify its underlying dynamics and its relation with previously-seen dynamics. In combination with fixed-memory experience replay mechanisms, this enables continual *slow update* of the *what-how* meta-model. Empirical studies demonstrated that both the meta- and continual-learning component was critical for learning to forecast across non-stationary distributions of diverse dynamics systems, and the feed-forward meta-model combined with task-aware/-relational continual learning strategies significantly outperformed existing CML alternatives",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs), while demonstrating remarkable capabilities across various applications, present significant challenges during inference due to their substantial model size, especially when deployed on edge devices. Activation sparsity offers a promising solution to reduce computation and memory movement, enabling more efficient inference, particularly for small-batch on-device applications. However, current approaches face limitations with non-ReLU activation function, which are foundational to most advanced LLMs, or require heavy continual training. Additionally, the difficulty in predicting active channels and limited achievable sparsity ratios constrain the effectiveness of activation sparsity-based methods. In this paper, we introduce R-Sparse, a training-free activation sparsity approach capable of achieving high sparsity levels in advanced LLMs. We conducted two preliminary investigations into how different components contribute to the output within a single linear layer and found two key observations: (i) the non-sparse components of the input function can be regarded as a few bias terms, and (ii) The full computation can be effectively approximated by an appropriate combination of input channels and weight singular values. Building on this, we replace the linear layers in LLMs with a rank-aware sparse inference method that leverages the sparsity of input channels and singular value components, eliminating the need for active channel prediction like the output sparsity based approaches. Experiments on Llama-2/3 and Mistral models across ten diverse tasks demonstrate that R-Sparse achieves comparable performance at 50\\% model-level sparsity, resulting in a significant 43\\% end-to-end efficient improvements with customized kernels",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute budget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total number of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a constant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in principle continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then, given any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model. Empirically, WSD generates an intriguing, non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains elevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss exhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river at its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the iterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it progresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly dropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer to the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained high learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress in the river and the mountain directions, respectively, and are both critical. Our analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and shows that this landscape can naturally emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram dataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that reuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where we resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and Cyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple pretrained language model checkpoints across various compute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B",

    "abstract": "Value-based reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle learn effective policies for a wide range of multi-turn problems, from games to dialogue to robotic control, including via offline RL from static previously collected datasets. However, despite the widespread use of policy gradient methods to train large language models for single turn tasks (e.g., question answering), value-based methods for multi-turn RL in an off-policy or offline setting have proven particularly challenging to scale to the setting of large language models. This setting requires effectively leveraging pretraining, scaling to large architectures with billions of parameters, and training on large datasets, all of which represent major challenges for current value-based RL methods. In this work, we propose a novel offline RL algorithm that addresses these drawbacks, casting Q-learning as a modified supervised fine-tuning (SFT) problem where the probabilities of tokens directly translate to Q-values. In this way we obtain an algorithm that smoothly transitions from maximizing the likelihood of the data during pretraining to learning a near-optimal Q-function during finetuning. Our algorithm has strong theoretical foundations, enjoying performance bounds similar to state-of-the-art Q-learning methods, while in practice utilizing an objective that closely resembles SFT. Because of this, our approach can enjoy the full benefits of the pretraining of language models, without the need to reinitialize any weights before RL finetuning, and without the need to initialize new heads for predicting values or advantages.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art retrieval models typically address a straightforward search scenario, in which retrieval tasks are fixed (e.g., finding a passage to answer a specific question) and only a single modality is supported for both queries and retrieved results. This paper introduces techniques for advancing information retrieval with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), enabling a broader search scenario, termed universal multimodal retrieval, where multiple modalities and diverse retrieval tasks are accommodated. To this end, we first study fine-tuning an MLLM as a bi-encoder retriever on 10 datasets with 16 retrieval tasks. Our empirical results show that the fine-tuned MLLM retriever is capable of understanding challenging queries, composed of both text and image, but it underperforms compared to a smaller CLIP retriever in cross-modal retrieval tasks due to the modality bias exhibited by MLLMs. To address the issue, we propose modality-aware hard negative mining to mitigate the modality bias exhibited by MLLM retrievers. Second, we propose continuously fine-tuning the universal multimodal retriever to enhance its text retrieval capability while preserving multimodal retrieval capability. As a result, our model, MM-Embed, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multimodal retrieval benchmark M-BEIR, which spans multiple domains and tasks, while also surpassing the state-of-the-art text retrieval model, NV-Embed-v1, on the MTEB retrieval benchmark. Finally, we explore prompting the off-the-shelf MLLMs as zero-shot rerankers to refine the ranking of the candidates from the multimodal retriever. We find that, through prompt-and-reranking, MLLMs can further improve multimodal retrieval when the user queries (e.g., text-image composed queries) are more complex and challenging to understand. These findings also pave the way for advancing universal multimodal retrieval in the future. We release the model weights at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/MM-Embed",

A key bottleneck lies in the inability of RNNs to perfectly retrieve information from the context, even with CoT: for several tasks that explicitly or implicitly require this capability, such as associative recall and determining if a graph is a tree, we prove that RNNs are not expressive enough to solve the tasks while Transformers can solve them with ease. Conversely, we prove that adopting techniques to enhance the in-context retrieval capability of RNNs, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and adding a single Transformer layer, can elevate RNNs to be capable of solving all polynomial-time solvable problems with CoT, hence closing the representation gap with Transformers.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and REBEL across various settings.

However, in recent years, diffusion models have emerged as a non-adversarial alternative to GANs that merely require training a score function via regression, yet produce generations of higher quality. In response, we investigate how to lift insights from diffusion modeling to the sequential setting. We propose diffusing states and performing *score-matching* along diffused states to measure the discrepancy between the expert's and learner's states. Thus, our approach only requires training score functions to predict noises via standard regression, making it significantly easier and more stable to train than adversarial methods. Theoretically, we prove first- and second-order instance-dependent bounds with linear scaling in the horizon, proving that our approach avoids the compounding errors that stymie offline approaches to imitation learning. Empirically, we show our approach outperforms both GAN-style imitation learning baselines and discriminator-free imitation learning baselines across various continuous control problems, including complex tasks like controlling humanoids to walk, sit, crawl, and navigate through obstacles",

    "abstract": "Entropy-based objectives are widely used to perform state space exploration in reinforcement learning (RL) and dataset generation for offline RL. Behavioral entropy (BE), a rigorous generalization of classical entropies that incorporates cognitive and perceptual biases of agents, was recently proposed for discrete settings and shown to be a promising metric for robotic exploration problems. In this work, we propose using BE as a principled exploration objective for systematically generating datasets that provide diverse state space coverage in complex, continuous, potentially high-dimensional domains. To achieve this, we extend the notion of BE to continuous settings, derive tractable $k$-nearest neighbor estimators, provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, and develop practical reward functions that can be used with standard RL methods to learn BE-maximizing policies. Using standard MuJoCo environments, we experimentally compare the performance of offline RL algorithms for a variety of downstream tasks on datasets generated using BE, R\\'{e}nyi, and Shannon entropy-maximizing policies, as well as the SMM and RND algorithms. We find that offline RL algorithms trained on datasets collected using BE outperform those trained on datasets collected using Shannon entropy, SMM, and RND on all tasks considered, and on 80\\% of the tasks compared to datasets collected using Renyi entropy",

Listening ability, in particular, is crucial for many applications, leading to research on building speech foundation models. However, the high computational cost of these large models presents a significant challenge for real-world applications. Although substantial efforts have been made to reduce computational costs, such as through pruning techniques, the majority of these approaches are applied primarily during the training phase for specific downstream tasks. In this study, we hypothesize that optimal pruned networks may vary based on contextual factors such as speaker characteristics, languages, and tasks. To address this, we propose a dynamic pruning technique that adapts to these contexts during inference without altering the underlying model. We demonstrated that we could successfully reduce inference time by approximately 30\\% while maintaining accuracy in multilingual/multi-task scenarios. We also found that the obtained pruned structure offers meaningful interpretations based on the context, e.g., task-related information emerging as the dominant factor for efficient pruning",

Training-free noise-space manipulation has proven to be an effective technique, where the challenge is to preserve the Gaussian white noise distribution while adding in temporal consistency. Recently, Chang et al. (2024) formulated this problem using an integral noise representation with distribution-preserving guarantees, and proposed an upsampling-based algorithm to compute it. However, while their mathematical formulation is advantageous, the algorithm incurs a high computational cost. Through analyzing the limiting-case behavior of their algorithm as the upsampling resolution goes to infinity, we develop an alternative algorithm that, by gathering increments of multiple Brownian bridges, achieves their infinite-resolution accuracy while simultaneously reducing the computational cost by orders of magnitude. We prove and experimentally validate our theoretical claims, and demonstrate our method's effectiveness in real-world applications.

    "abstract": "Improving social welfare is a complex challenge requiring policymakers to optimize objectives across multiple time horizons. Evaluating the impact of such policies presents a fundamental challenge, as those that appear suboptimal in the short run may yield significant long-term benefits. We tackle this challenge by analyzing the long-term dynamics of two prominent policy frameworks: Rawlsian policies, which prioritize those with the greatest need, and utilitarian policies, which maximize immediate welfare gains. Conventional wisdom suggests these policies are at odds, as Rawlsian policies are assumed to come at the cost of reducing the average social welfare, which their utilitarian counterparts directly optimize. We challenge this assumption by analyzing these policies in a sequential decision-making framework where individuals' welfare levels stochastically decay over time, and policymakers can intervene to prevent this decay. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that interventions following Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies in the long run, even when the latter dominate in the short run. We characterize the exact conditions under which Rawlsian policies can outperform utilitarian policies. We further illustrate our theoretical findings using simulations, which highlight the risks of evaluating policies based solely on their short-term effects. Our results underscore the necessity of considering long-term horizons in designing and evaluating welfare policies; the true efficacy of even well-established policies may only emerge over time",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal multi-task learning holds significant promise in tackling complex diagnostic tasks and many significant medical imaging problems. It fulfills the needs in real-world diagnosis protocol to leverage information from different data sources and simultaneously perform mutually informative tasks. However, medical imaging domains introduce two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The quality and amount of task-related information from different modalities could vary significantly across patient samples, due to biological and demographic factors. Traditional fusion methods apply fixed combination strategies that fail to capture this dynamic relationship, potentially underutilizing modalities that carry stronger diagnostic signals for specific patients. Additionally, different clinical tasks may require dynamic feature selection and combination from various modalities, a phenomenon we term \"modality-task dependence.\" To address these issues, we propose M4oE, a novel Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts framework for precise Medical diagnosis. M4oE comprises Modality-Specific (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. With collaboration from both modules, our model dynamically decomposes and learns distinct and shared information from different modalities and achieves dynamic fusion. MToE provides a joint probability model of modalities and tasks by using experts as a link and encourages experts to learn modality-task dependence via conditional mutual information loss. By doing so, M4oE offers sample and population-level interpretability of modality contributions. We evaluate M4oE on four public multi-modal medical benchmark datasets for solving two important medical diagnostic problems including breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Designing synthetically accessible molecules and recommending analogs to unsynthesizable molecules are important problems for accelerating molecular discovery. We reconceptualize both problems using ideas from program synthesis. Drawing inspiration from syntax-guided synthesis approaches, we decouple the syntactic skeleton from the semantics of a synthetic tree to create a bilevel framework for reasoning about the combinatorial space of synthesis pathways. Given a molecule we aim to generate analogs for, we iteratively refine its skeletal characteristics via Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations over the space of syntactic skeletons. Given a black-box oracle to optimize, we formulate a joint design space over syntactic templates and molecular descriptors and introduce evolutionary algorithms that optimize both syntactic and semantic dimensions synergistically. Our key insight is that once the syntactic skeleton is set, we can amortize over the search complexity of deriving the program's semantics by training policies to fully utilize the fixed horizon Markov Decision Process imposed by the syntactic template. We demonstrate performance advantages of our bilevel framework for synthesizable analog generation and synthesizable molecule design. Notably, our approach offers the user explicit control over the resources required to perform synthesis and biases the design space towards simpler solutions, making it particularly promising for autonomous synthesis platforms.

This is inspired by \"LLM metacognition\" of (Didolkar et al., 2024); (2) Data generation: uses the powerful LLM to generate (instruction, response) data that exhibit a randomly chosen pair of these skills. Here, the use of random skill combinations promotes diversity and difficulty. The estimated cost of creating the dataset is under $600. Vanilla SFT (i.e., no PPO, DPO, or RL methods) on data generated from INSTRUCT-SKILLMIX leads to strong gains on instruction following benchmarks such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, and WildBench. With just 4K examples, LLaMA-3-8B-Base achieves 42.76% length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval 2.0, a level similar to frontier models like Claude 3 Opus and LLaMA-3.1-405B-Instruct. Ablation studies also suggest plausible reasons for why creating open instruction-tuning datasets via naive crowd-sourcing has proved difficult.

However, the limited hidden state representation of LIF neurons, characterized by a scalar membrane potential, and sequential spike generation process, poses challenges for effectively developing scalable spiking models to address long-range dependencies in sequence learning tasks. In this study, we develop a scalable probabilistic spiking learning framework for long-range dependency tasks leveraging the fundamentals of state space models. Unlike LIF neurons that rely on the deterministic Heaviside function for a sequential process of spike generation, we introduce a SpikeSampler layer that samples spikes stochastically based on an SSM-based neuronal model while allowing parallel computations. To address non-differentiability of the spiking operation and enable effective training, we also propose a surrogate function tailored for the stochastic nature of the SpikeSampler layer. To enhance inter-neuron communication, we introduce the SpikeMixer block, which integrates spikes from neuron populations in each layer. This is followed by a ClampFuse layer, incorporating a residual connection to capture complex dependencies, enabling scalability of the model.

In this work, we investigate the behavior of linear transformers trained on random linear classification tasks. Via an analysis of the implicit regularization of gradient descent, we characterize how many pre-training tasks and in-context examples are needed for the trained transformer to generalize well at test-time. We further show that in some settings, these trained transformers can exhibit ''benign overfitting in-context'': when in-context examples are corrupted by label flipping noise, the transformer memorizes all of its in-context examples (including those with noisy labels) yet still generalizes near-optimally for clean test examples",

Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of various prompting strategies in aiding LLMs in reasoning (called \"reasoning actions\"), such as step-by-step thinking, reflecting before answering, solving with programs, and their combinations. However, these approaches often applied static, predefined reasoning actions uniformly to all questions, without considering the specific characteristics of each question or the capability of the task-solving LLM. In this paper, we propose DOTS, an approach enabling LLMs to reason Dynamically via Optimal reasoning Trajectories Search, tailored to the specific characteristics of each question and the inherent capability of the task-solving LLM. Our approach involves three key steps: i) defining atomic reasoning action modules that can be composed into various reasoning action trajectories; ii) searching for the optimal action trajectory for each training question through iterative exploration and evaluation for the specific task-solving LLM; and iii) using the collected optimal trajectories to train an LLM to plan for the reasoning trajectories of unseen questions. In particular, we propose two learning paradigms, i.e., fine-tuning an external LLM as a planner to guide the task-solving LLM, or directly fine-tuning the task-solving LLM with an internalized capability for reasoning actions planning. Our experiments across eight reasoning tasks show that our method consistently outperforms static reasoning techniques and the vanilla instruction tuning approach. Further analysis reveals that our method enables LLMs to adjust their computation based on problem complexity, allocating deeper thinking and reasoning to harder problems",

From this perspective, we derive a new spectral regularizer for continual learning that better sustains these beneficial initialization properties throughout training. In particular, the regularizer keeps the maximum singular value of each layer close to one. Spectral regularization directly ensures that gradient diversity is maintained throughout training, which promotes continual trainability, while minimally interfering with performance in a single task. We present an experimental analysis that shows how the proposed spectral regularizer can sustain trainability and performance across a range of model architectures in continual supervised and reinforcement learning settings.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine learning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model's behavior becomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the behavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development, may allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug concentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero in the long term) and to design dosing guidelines (e.g., by looking at the peak concentration and its timing). Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation and then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use is currently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming, requiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the equation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not satisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to rectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and its behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling low-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step modeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then analyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic representation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior) directly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This direct approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases into the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly, ensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only simplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and flexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs",

Our scheme works by selecting the initial latents of a diffusion model using a pseudorandom error-correcting code (Christ and Gunn, 2024), a strategy which guarantees undetectability and robustness. We experimentally demonstrate that our watermarks are quality-preserving and robust using Stable Diffusion 2.1. Our experiments verify that, in contrast to _every prior scheme_ we tested, our watermark does not degrade image quality. Our experiments also demonstrate robustness: existing watermark removal attacks fail to remove our watermark from images without significantly degrading the quality of the images. Finally, we find that we can robustly encode 512 bits in our watermark, and up to 2500 bits when the images are not subjected to watermark removal attacks.

    "abstract": "Prompting Large Language Models (LLMs), or providing context on the expected model of operation, is an effective way to steer the outputs of such models to satisfy human desiderata after they have been trained. But in rapidly evolving domains, there is often need to fine-tune LLMs to improve either the kind of knowledge in their memory or their abilities to perform open ended reasoning in new domains. When human's learn new concepts, we often do so by linking the new material that we are studying to concepts we have already learned before. To that end, we ask, \"can prompting help us teach LLMs how to learn\". In this work, we study a novel generalization of instruction tuning, called contextual fine-tuning, to fine-tune LLMs. Our method leverages instructional prompts designed to mimic human cognitive strategies in learning and problem-solving to guide the learning process during training, aiming to improve the model's interpretation and understanding of domain-specific knowledge. We empirically demonstrate that this simple yet effective modification improves the ability of LLMs to be fine-tuned rapidly on new datasets both within the medical and financial domains",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep learning models trained on computer vision tasks are widely considered the most successful models of human vision to date. The majority of work that supports this idea evaluates how accurately these models predict behavior and brain responses to static images of objects and scenes. Real-world vision, however, is highly dynamic, and far less work has evaluated deep learning models on human responses to moving stimuli, especially those that involve more complicated, higher-order phenomena like social interactions. Here, we extend a dataset of natural videos depicting complex multi-agent interactions by collecting human-annotated sentence captions for each video, and we benchmark 350+ image, video, and language models on behavior and neural responses to the videos. As in prior work, we find that many vision models reach the noise ceiling in predicting visual scene features and responses along the ventral visual stream (often considered the primary neural substrate of object and scene recognition). In contrast, vision models poorly predict human action and social interaction ratings and neural responses in the lateral stream (a neural pathway theorized to specialize in dynamic, social vision), though video models show a striking advantage in predicting mid-level lateral stream regions. Language models (given human sentence captions of the videos) predict action and social ratings better than image and video models, but perform poorly at predicting neural responses in the lateral stream. Together, these results identify a major gap in AI's ability to match human social vision and provide insights to guide future model development for dynamic, natural contexts",

In this work, we prove information-theoretic hardness for model-free OPE of history-dependent policies in several settings, characterized by additional assumptions imposed on the behavior policy (memoryless vs. history-dependent) and/or the state-revealing property of the POMDP (single-step vs. multi-step revealing).

    "abstract": "Reducing the likelihood of generating harmful and toxic output is an essential task when aligning large language models (LLMs). Existing methods mainly rely on training an external reward model (i.e., another language model) or fine-tuning the LLM using self-generated data to influence the outcome. In this paper, we show that LLMs have the capability of self-detoxification without external reward model learning or retraining of the LM. We propose \\textit{Self-disciplined Autoregressive Sampling (SASA)}, a lightweight controlled decoding algorithm for toxicity reduction of LLMs. SASA leverages the contextual representations from an LLM to learn linear subspaces from labeled data characterizing toxic v.s. non-toxic output in analytical forms. When auto-completing a response token-by-token, SASA dynamically tracks the margin of the current output to steer the generation away from the toxic subspace, by adjusting the autoregressive sampling strategy. Evaluated on LLMs of different scale and nature, namely Llama-3.1-Instruct (8B), Llama-2 (7B), and GPT2-L models with the RealToxicityPrompts, BOLD, and AttaQ benchmarks, SASA markedly enhances the quality of the generated sentences relative to the original models and attains comparable performance to state-of-the-art detoxification techniques, significantly reducing the toxicity level by only using the LLM's internal representations",

    "title": "STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the \"sub\"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape the AI landscape, fine-tuning pretrained models has become more popular than in the pre-LLM era for achieving optimal performance in domain-specific tasks. However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved (i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PORTLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B,Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PORTLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2× in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) often relies on trial and error, which may cause undesirable outcomes. As a result, standard RL is inappropriate for safety-critical applications. To address this issue, one may train a safe agent in a controlled environment (where safety violations are allowed) and then transfer it to the real world (where safety violations may have disastrous consequences). Prior work has made this transfer safe as long as the new environment preserves the safety-related dynamics. However, in most practical applications, differences or shifts in dynamics between the two environments are inevitable, potentially leading to safety violations after the transfer. This work aims to guarantee safety even when the new environment has different (safety-related) dynamics. In other words, we aim to make the process of safe transfer robust. Our methodology (1) robustifies an agent in the controlled environment and (2) provably provides---under mild assumption---a safe transfer to new environments. The empirical evaluation shows that this method yields policies that are robust against changes in dynamics, demonstrating safety after transfer to a new environment",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a promising approach to interpreting the internal representations of transformer language models. However, SAEs are usually trained separately on each transformer layer, making it difficult to use them to study how information flows across layers. To solve this problem, we introduce the multi-layer SAE (MLSAE): a single SAE trained on the residual stream activation vectors from every transformer layer. Given that the residual stream is understood to preserve information across layers, we expected MLSAE latents to 'switch on' at a token position and remain active at later layers. Interestingly, we find that individual latents are often active at a single layer for a given token or prompt, but the layer at which an individual latent is active may differ for different tokens or prompts. We quantify these phenomena by defining a distribution over layers and considering its variance. We find that the variance of the distributions of latent activations over layers is about two orders of magnitude greater when aggregating over tokens compared with a single token. For larger underlying models, the degree to which latents are active at multiple layers increases, which is consistent with the fact that the residual stream activation vectors at adjacent layers become more similar. Finally, we relax the assumption that the residual stream basis is the same at every layer by applying pre-trained tuned-lens transformations, but our findings remain qualitatively similar. Our results represent a new approach to understanding how representations change as they flow through transformers.

In a focused case study on English and Chinese multilingual and monolingual models, we analyze the internal circuitry involved in two tasks. We find evidence that models employ the same circuit to handle the same syntactic process independently of the language in which it occurs, and that this is the case even for monolingual models trained completely independently. Moreover, we show that multilingual models employ language-specific components (attention heads and feed-forward networks) when needed to handle linguistic processes (e.g., morphological marking) that only exist in some languages. Together, our results are revealing about how LLMs trade off between exploiting common structures and preserving linguistic differences when tasked with modeling multiple languages simultaneously, opening the door for future work in this direction",

    "title": "Disentangling Representations through Multi-task Learning",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Intelligent perception and interaction with the world hinges on internal representations that capture its underlying structure (\"disentangled\" or \"abstract\" representations). Disentangled representations serve as world models, isolating latent factors of variation in the world along approximately orthogonal directions, thus facilitating feature-based generalization. We provide experimental and theoretical results guaranteeing the emergence of disentangled representations in agents that optimally solve multi-task evidence accumulation classification tasks, canonical in the neuroscience literature. The key conceptual finding is that, by producing accurate multi-task classification estimates, a system implicitly represents a set of coordinates specifying a disentangled representation of the underlying latent state of the data it receives. The theory provides conditions for the emergence of these representations in terms of noise, number of tasks, and evidence accumulation time, when the classification boundaries are affine in the latent space. Surprisingly, the theory also produces closed-form expressions for extracting the disentangled representation from the model's latent state $\\mathbf Z(t)$. We experimentally validate these predictions in RNNs trained on multi-task classification, which learn disentangled representations in the form of continuous attractors, leading to zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in predicting latent factors. We demonstrate the robustness of our framework across autoregressive architectures, decision boundary geometries and in tasks requiring classification confidence estimation. We find that transformers are particularly suited for disentangling representations, which might explain their unique world understanding abilities. Overall, our framework establishes a formal link between competence at multiple tasks and the formation of disentangled, interpretable world models in both biological and artificial systems, and helps explain why ANNs often arrive at human-interpretable concepts, and how they both may acquire exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities",

One strategy for guiding ODE-based generative models is through optimizing a target loss $R(x_1)$ while staying close to the prior distribution.

Despite the superior performance, the theoretical understanding of this line of methods is still preliminary, leaving space for algorithm improvement. Moreover, existing methods predominately focus on Euclidean data manifold, and there is a compelling need for guided flow methods on complex geometries such as SO(3), which prevails in high-stake scientific applications like protein design. We present OC-Flow, a general and theoretically grounded training-free framework for guided flow matching using optimal control. Building upon advances in optimal control theory, we develop effective and practical algorithms for solving optimal control in guided ODE-based generation and provide a systematic theoretical analysis of the convergence guarantee in both Euclidean and SO(3).

    "abstract": "Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) is a pivotal tool in data analysis and dimensionality reduction. However, Sparse PCA is a challenging problem in both theory and practice: it is known to be NP-hard and current exact methods generally require exponential runtime. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to efficiently approximate Sparse PCA by (i) approximating the general input covariance matrix with a re-sorted block-diagonal matrix, (ii) solving the Sparse PCA sub-problem in each block, and (iii) reconstructing the solution to the original problem. Our framework is simple and powerful: it can leverage any off-the-shelf Sparse PCA algorithm and achieve significant computational speedups, with a minor additive error that is linear in the approximation error of the block-diagonal matrix. Suppose $g(k, d)$ is the runtime of an algorithm (approximately) solving Sparse PCA in dimension $d$ and with sparsity constant $k$. Our framework, when integrated with this algorithm, reduces the runtime to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{d}{d^\\star} \\cdot g(k, d^\\star) + d^2\\right)$, where $d^\\star \\leq d$ is the largest block size of the block-diagonal matrix. For instance, integrating our framework with the Branch-and-Bound algorithm reduces the complexity from $g(k, d) = \\mathcal{O}(k^3\\cdot d^k)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(k^3\\cdot d \\cdot (d^\\star)^{k-1})$, demonstrating exponential speedups if $d^\\star$ is small. We perform large-scale evaluations on many real-world datasets: for exact Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 100.50, while maintaining an average approximation error of 0.61%; for approximate Sparse PCA algorithm, our method achieves an average speedup factor of 6.00 and an average approximation error of -0.91%, meaning that our method oftentimes finds better solutions",

The standard composition-based privacy analysis of DP-SGD effectively assumes that the adversary has access to all intermediate iterates, which is often unrealistic. However, this analysis remains the state of the art in practice.

    "abstract": "The generative modeling of data on manifolds is an important task, for which diffusion models in flat spaces typically need nontrivial adaptations. This article demonstrates how a technique called `trivialization' can transfer the effectiveness of diffusion models in Euclidean spaces to Lie groups. In particular, an auxiliary momentum variable was algorithmically introduced to help transport the position variable between data distribution and a fixed, easy-to-sample distribution. Normally, this would incur further difficulty for manifold data because momentum lives in a space that changes with the position. However, our trivialization technique creates a new momentum variable that stays in a simple fixed vector space. This design, together with a manifold preserving integrator, simplifies implementation and avoids inaccuracies created by approximations such as projections to tangent space and manifold, which were typically used in prior work, hence facilitating generation with high-fidelity and efficiency. The resulting method achieves state-of-the-art performance on protein and RNA torsion angle generation and sophisticated torus datasets.

    "abstract": "We address the challenge of zeroth-order online convex optimization where the objective function's gradient exhibits sparsity, indicating that only a small number of dimensions possess non-zero gradients. Our aim is to leverage this sparsity to obtain useful estimates of the objective function's gradient even when the only information available is a limited number of function samples. Our motivation stems from the optimization of large-scale queueing networks that process time-sensitive jobs. Here, a job must be processed by potentially many queues in sequence to produce an output, and the service time at any queue is a function of the resources allocated to that queue. Since resources are costly, the end-to-end latency for jobs must be balanced with the overall cost of the resources used. While the number of queues is substantial, the latency function primarily reacts to resource changes in only a few, rendering the gradient sparse. We tackle this problem by introducing the Compressive Online Gradient Optimization framework which allows compressive sensing methods previously applied to stochastic optimization to achieve regret bounds with an optimal dependence on the time horizon without the full problem dimension appearing in the bound. For specific algorithms, we reduce the samples required per gradient estimate to scale with the gradient's sparsity factor rather than its full dimensionality.

For a variety of innocuous prompt categories (e.g., writing a letter or a tutorial), we show that up to 15% of the text output by popular conversational language models overlaps with snippets from the Internet.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from data that can assist organizations in making effective decisions. We introduce InsightBench, a benchmark dataset with three key features. First, it consists of 100 datasets representing diverse business use cases such as finance and incident management, each accompanied by a carefully curated set of insights planted in the datasets. Second, unlike existing benchmarks focusing on answering single queries, InsightBench evaluates agents based on their ability to perform end-to-end data analytics, including formulating questions, interpreting answers, and generating a summary of insights and actionable steps. Third, we conducted comprehensive quality assurance to ensure that each dataset in the benchmark had clear goals and included relevant and meaningful questions and analysis. Furthermore, we implement a two-way evaluation mechanism using LLaMA-3 as an effective, open-source evaluator to assess agents' ability to extract insights. We also propose AgentPoirot, our baseline data analysis agent capable of performing end-to-end data analytics. Our evaluation on InsightBench shows that AgentPoirot outperforms existing approaches (such as Pandas Agent) that focus on resolving single queries. We also compare the performance of open- and closed-source LLMs and various evaluation strategies. Overall, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in comprehensive automated data analytics and can be accessed here: https://github.com/ServiceNow/insight-bench",

    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization devolves the global optimization of a costly objective function to the global optimization of a sequence of acquisition functions. This inner-loop optimization can be catastrophically difficult if it involves posterior sample paths, especially in higher dimensions. We introduce an efficient global optimization strategy for posterior samples based on global rootfinding. It provides gradient-based optimizers with two sets of judiciously selected starting points, designed to combine exploration and exploitation. The number of starting points can be kept small without sacrificing optimization quality. Remarkably, even with just one point from each set, the global optimum is discovered most of the time. The algorithm scales practically linearly to high dimensions, breaking the curse of dimensionality. For Gaussian process Thompson sampling (GP-TS), we demonstrate remarkable improvement in both inner- and outer-loop optimization, surprisingly outperforming alternatives like EI and GP-UCB in most cases. Our approach also improves the performance of other posterior sample-based acquisition functions, such as variants of entropy search. Furthermore, we propose a sample-average formulation of GP-TS, which has a parameter to explicitly control exploitation and can be computed at the cost of one posterior sample",

    "title": "Model-Agnostic Knowledge Guided Correction for Improved Neural Surrogate Rollout",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Modeling the evolution of physical systems is critical to many applications in science and engineering. As the evolution of these systems is governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), there are a number of computational simulations which resolve these systems with high accuracy. However, as these simulations incur high computational costs, they are infeasible to be employed for large-scale analysis. A popular alternative to simulators are neural network surrogates which are trained in a data-driven manner and are much more computationally efficient. However, these surrogate models suffer from high rollout error when used autoregressively, especially when confronted with training data paucity. Existing work proposes to improve surrogate rollout error by either including physical loss terms directly in the optimization of the model or incorporating computational simulators as `differentiable layers' in the neural network. Both of these approaches have their challenges, with physical loss functions suffering from slow convergence for stiff PDEs and simulator layers requiring gradients which are not always available, especially in legacy simulators. We propose the Hybrid PDE Predictor with Reinforcement Learning (HyPER) model: a model-agnostic, RL based, cost-aware model which combines a neural surrogate, RL decision model, and a physics simulator (with or without gradients) to reduce surrogate rollout error significantly. In addition to reducing in-distribution rollout error by **47%-78%**, HyPER learns an intelligent policy that is adaptable to changing physical conditions and resistant to noise corruption.

    "title": "Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. At test time, MLFFs must also obey physical constraints unique to the downstream use case, such as energy conservation for molecular dynamics simulations. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as an architecture-agnostic knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller \"student\" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the \"teacher\" foundation model. We demonstrate our approach across multiple recent foundation models, large-scale datasets, chemical subsets, and downstream tasks. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 times faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation ``engines\" for common chemical subsets.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The self-attention mechanism traditionally relies on the softmax operator, necessitating positional embeddings like RoPE, or position biases to account for token order. But current methods using still face length generalisation challenges. We investigate an alternative attention mechanism based on the stick-breaking process in larger scale settings. The method works as follows: For each token before the current, we determine a break point, which represents the proportion of the stick, the weight of the attention, to allocate to the current token. We repeat this on the remaining stick, until all tokens are allocated a weight, resulting in a sequence of attention weights. This process naturally incorporates recency bias, which has linguistic motivations for grammar parsing (Shen et al., 2017). We study the implications of replacing the conventional softmax-based attention mechanism with stick-breaking attention. We then discuss implementation of numerically stable stick-breaking attention and adapt Flash Attention to accommodate this mechanism. When used as a drop-in replacement for current softmax+RoPE attention systems, we find that stick-breaking attention performs competitively with current methods on length generalisation and downstream tasks. Stick-breaking also performs well at length generalisation, allowing a model trained with $2^{11}$ context window to perform well at $2^{14}$ with perplexity improvements",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models optimized via variational inference (VI) have emerged as a promising tool for generating samples from unnormalized target densities. These models create samples by simulating a stochastic differential equation, starting from a simple, tractable prior, typically a Gaussian distribution. However, when the support of this prior differs greatly from that of the target distribution, diffusion models often struggle to explore effectively or suffer from large discretization errors. Moreover, learning the prior distribution can lead to mode-collapse, exacerbated by the mode-seeking nature of reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in VI. To address these challenges, we propose end-to-end learnable Gaussian mixture priors (GMPs). GMPs offer improved control over exploration, adaptability to target support, and increased expressiveness to counteract mode collapse. We further leverage the structure of mixture models by proposing a strategy to iteratively refine the model through the addition of mixture components during training. Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements across a diverse range of real-world and synthetic benchmark problems when using GMPs without requiring additional target evaluations",

To address this, we introduce IterGen, a user-friendly library for iterative, grammar-guided LLM generation that enables users to move both forward and backward within the generated output based on grammar symbols. By leveraging a symbol-to-position mapping and maintaining the key-value (KV) cache state, IterGen ensures efficient and structured generation while allowing for corrections during the process.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Scaling inference-time computation is increasingly seen as the next frontier in scaling laws for large language models. Previous work in mathematics and coding has demonstrated the remarkable potential for inference-time scaling. During such scaling, fine-grained supervision through process-based reward models (PRMs) is essential for enhancement. However, exploration of inference-time scaling and PRMs in open-domain problems remains limited, where lacking exact answers and obtaining process supervision prove challenging. In this paper, we explore the construction of PRMs for open-domain tasks, specifically for instruction-following tasks. Utilizing existing outcome-based reward models (ORMs), we develop sentence-level preference trees based on the prefix similarity of parallel sampled candidates from datasets like UltraFeedback. This setup allows us to derive weak supervision for processes via back-propagation from outcome-level rewards. Subsequently, we integrate ORMs and PRMs under the same pairwise ranking objectives, resulting in our newly developed reward models, named OpenPRM. This approach significantly enhances the scalability of process-level supervision in open domains at minimal cost. We assess the performance of OpenPRM across various reward benchmarks, demonstrating its competitive edge over traditional ORMs in open domains and PRMs in specialized domains. Additionally, we investigate the scalability of inference-time computation for open-domain instructions. Our results highlight the limitations of ORMs' scalability, while OpenPRM shows superior performance in scaled settings. Despite these advances, achieving automatic fine-grained supervision for open-domain inference-time scaling remains a substantial challenge. We hope these findings will spur further development of process supervision reward models in open-domain scenarios",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse tasks, yet their training remains highly resource intensive and susceptible to critical challenges such as training instability. A predominant source of this instability stems from gradient and loss spikes, which disrupt the learning process, often leading to costly interventions like checkpoint recovery and experiment restarts, further amplifying inefficiencies. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into gradient spikes observed during LLM training, revealing their prevalence across multiple architectures and datasets. Our analysis shows that these spikes can be up to 1000× larger than typical gradients, substantially deteriorating model performance. To address this issue, we propose Spike-Aware Adam with Momentum Reset (SPAM), a novel optimizer designed to counteract gradient spikes through momentum reset and spike-aware gradient clipping. Extensive experiments, including both pre-training and fine-tuning, demonstrate that SPAM consistently surpasses Adam and its variants across a range of model scales. Additionally, SPAM facilitates memory-efficient training by enabling sparse momentum, where only a subset of momentum terms are maintained and updated. When operating under memory constraints, SPAM outperforms state-of-the-art memory-efficient optimizers such as GaLore and Adam-Mini. Our work underscores the importance of mitigating gradient spikes in LLM training and introduces an effective optimization strategy that enhances both training stability and resource efficiency at scale.

We predict in simple hierarchical models that, in this process, changes in data occur by correlated chunks, with a length scale that diverges at a noise level where a phase transition is known to take place. Remarkably, we confirm this prediction in both text and image datasets using state-of-the-art diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Analyzing the similarity of internal representations within and across different models has been an important technique for understanding the behavior of deep neural networks. Most existing methods for analyzing the similarity between representations of high dimensions, such as those based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), rely on statistical properties of the representations for a set of data points. In this paper, we focus on transformer models and study the similarity of representations between the hidden layers of individual transformers. In this context, we show that a simple sample-wise cosine similarity metric is capable of capturing the similarity and aligns with the complicated CKA. Our experimental results on common transformers reveal that representations across layers are positively correlated, with similarity increasing when layers get closer. We provide a theoretical justification for this phenomenon under the geodesic curve assumption for the learned transformer, a property that may approximately hold for residual networks. We then show that an increase in representation similarity implies an increase in predicted probability when directly applying the last-layer classifier to any hidden layer representation. This offers a justification for {\\it saturation events}, where the model's top prediction remains unchanged across subsequent layers, indicating that the shallow layer has already learned the necessary knowledge. We then propose an aligned training method to improve the effectiveness of shallow layer by enhancing the similarity between internal representations, with trained models that enjoy the following properties: (1) more early saturation events, (2) layer-wise accuracies monotonically increase and reveal the minimal depth needed for the given task, (3) when served as multi-exit models, they achieve on-par performance with standard multi-exit architectures which consist of additional classifiers designed for early exiting in shallow layers. To our knowledge, our work is the first to show that one common classifier is sufficient for multi-exit models.

In contrast, causal representation learning (CRL) focuses on identifying the underlying causal structure within a given environment. We propose a framework that integrates CRLs with LLMs to enable causally-aware reasoning and planning. This framework learns a causal world model, with causal variables linked to natural language expressions. This mapping provides LLMs with a flexible interface to process and generate descriptions of actions and states in text form. Effectively, the causal world model acts as a simulator that the LLM can query and interact with.

Our goal is to materialize such theories - here called microtheories (a linguistic analog of logical microtheories) - as a set of sentences encapsulating an LM's core knowledge about a topic. These statements systematically work together to entail answers to a set of questions to both engender trust and improve performance. Our approach is to first populate a knowledge store with (model-generated) sentences that entail answers to training questions, and then distill those down to a core microtheory which is concise, general, and non-redundant. We show that, when added to a general corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), microtheories can supply critical information not necessarily present in the corpus, improving both a model's ability to ground its answers to verifiable knowledge (i.e., show how answers are systematically entailed by documents in the corpus, grounding up to +8% more answers), and the accuracy of those grounded answers (up to +8% absolute). We also show that, in a human evaluation in the medical domain, our distilled microtheories contain a significantly higher concentration of topically critical facts than the non-distilled knowledge store. Finally, we show we can quantify the coverage of a microtheory for a topic (characterized by a dataset) using a notion of p-relevance. Together, these suggest that microtheories are an efficient distillation of an LM's topic-relevant knowledge, that they can usefully augment existing corpora, and can provide both performance gains and an interpretable, verifiable window into the model's knowledge of a topic",

We propose novel algorithms for staggering asynchronous inference processes to ensure that actions are taken at consistent time intervals, and demonstrate that use of models with high action inference times is only constrained by the environment's effective stochasticity over the inference horizon, and not by action frequency.

To avoid any possibility of data leakage, ForecastBench is comprised solely of questions about future events that have no known answer at the time of submission. We quantify the capabilities of current ML systems by collecting forecasts from expert (human) forecasters, the general public, and LLMs on a random subset of questions from the benchmark ($N=200$). While LLMs have achieved super-human performance on many benchmarks, they perform less well here: expert forecasters outperform the top-performing LLM ($p$-value $<0.001$). We display system and human scores in a public leaderboard at www.forecastbench.org",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods incorporate PDE residuals as the loss function for solving Fokker-Planck equations, and usually impose the proper normalization condition to avoid a trivial solution. However, soft constraints require careful balancing of multi-objective loss functions, and specific network architectures may limit representation capacity under hard constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework: Fokker-Planck neural network (FPNN) that adopts a score PDE loss to decouple the score learning and the density normalization into two stages. Our method allows free-form network architectures to model the unnormalized density and strictly satisfy normalization constraints by post-processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness on various high-dimensional steady-state Fokker-Planck (SFP) equations, achieving superior accuracy and over a 20$\\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods. Without any labeled data, FPNNs achieve the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 11.36%, 13.87% and 12.72% for 4D Ring, 6D Unimodal and 6D Multi-modal problems respectively, requiring only 256, 980, and 980 parameters.

In this paper, we introduce ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates this process using inverse design. Given an agent's behavior (such as a motion trajectory or objective function) and its textual description, we infer the underlying scenarios and environments that could have caused the behavior. Our approach leverages large language models to construct and expand a graph that captures cause-and-effect relationships and relevant entities with properties in the environment, which is then processed to configure a robot simulation environment. Our approach supports (i) augmenting simulations based on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation, (iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We demonstrate our method in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks, generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for improved generalization and robustness",

    "abstract": "Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of dependence between random variables, but its practical application is limited because it is difficult to calculate in many circumstances. Variational methods offer one approach by introducing an approximate distribution to create various bounds on MI, which in turn is an easier optimization problem to solve. In practice, the variational distribution chosen is often a Gaussian, which is convenient but lacks flexibility in modeling complicated distributions. In this paper, we introduce new classes of variational estimators based on Normalizing Flows that extend the previous Gaussian-based variational estimators. Our new estimators maintain many of the same theoretical guarantees while simultaneously enhancing the expressivity of the variational distribution. We experimentally verify that our new methods are effective on large MI problems where discriminative-based estimators, such as MINE and InfoNCE, are fundamentally limited. Furthermore, we compare against a diverse set of benchmarking tests to show that the flow-based estimators often perform as well, if not better, than the discriminative-based counterparts. Finally, we demonstrate how these estimators can be effectively utilized in the Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design setting for online sequential decision making",

Here, we present the first unbiased, higher-derivative-free policy gradient algorithm for learning-aware reinforcement learning, which takes into account that other agents are themselves learning through trial and error based on multiple noisy trials. We then leverage efficient sequence models to condition behavior on long observation histories that contain traces of the learning dynamics of other agents. Training long-context policies with our algorithm leads to cooperative behavior and high returns on standard social dilemmas, including a challenging environment where temporally-extended action coordination is required. Finally, we derive from the iterated prisoner's dilemma a novel explanation for how and when cooperation arises among self-interested learning-aware agents",

    "abstract": "We propose Few-Class Arena (FCA), as a unified benchmark with focus on testing efficient image classification models for few classes. A wide variety of benchmark datasets with many classes (80-1000) have been created to assist Computer Vision architectural evolution. An increasing number of vision models are evaluated with these many-class datasets. However, real-world applications often involve substantially fewer classes of interest (2-10). This gap between many and few classes makes it difficult to predict performance of the few-class applications using models trained on the available many-class datasets. To date, little has been offered to evaluate models in this Few-Class Regime. We conduct a systematic evaluation of the ResNet family trained on ImageNet subsets from 2 to 1000 classes, and test a wide spectrum of Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformer architectures over ten datasets by using our newly proposed FCA tool. Furthermore, to aid an up-front assessment of dataset difficulty and a more efficient selection of models, we incorporate a difficulty measure as a function of class similarity. FCA offers a new tool for efficient machine learning in the Few-Class Regime, with goals ranging from a new efficient class similarity proposal, to lightweight model architecture design, to a new scaling law. FCA is user-friendly and can be easily extended to new models and datasets, facilitating future research work. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/bryanbocao/fca",

    "abstract": "Search is an ability foundational in many important tasks, and recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs) struggle to perform search robustly. It is unknown whether this inability is due to a lack of data, insufficient model parameters, or fundamental limitations of the transformer architecture. In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem as a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train small transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find that, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to learn to search. We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel mechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the computation graph from the trained model. We find that for each vertex in the input graph, transformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer then progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a number of vertices exponential in the number of layers. However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has greater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even as the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model scale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing search in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to learn to search on larger graphs",

This property is desirable in applications in order to have number of trainable parameters that is independent of the size of the input graphs. Uniform expressivity of the two variable guarded fragment (GC2) of first order logic is a well-celebrated result for Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) GNNs [Barcelo &. Al, 2020]. In this article, we prove that uniform expressivity of GC2 queries is not possible for GNNs with a wide class of Pfaffian activation functions (including the sigmoid and $\\tanh$), answering a question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We also show that despite these limitations, many of those GNNs can still efficiently express GC2 queries in a way that the number of parameters remains logarithmic on the maximal degree of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a log-log dependency on the degree is achievable for a certain choice of activation function. This shows that uniform expressivity can be successfully relaxed by covering large graphs appearing in practical applications.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI. However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to support. The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it belongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common instead to evaluate language models on proxy tasks, e.g., language modeling or sequence-to-sequence transduction, that are similar in only an informal sense to the underlying theory. We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part of this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Snæbjarnarson et al. (2025) for efficient length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages. We provide results on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neural architectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. We find that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliary training objectives such as language modeling can help, although no single objective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures. Our contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing of language recognition claims in future work.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\left(1,2\\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{3\\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique – gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{3\\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{1-\\mathfrak{p}}{2\\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be state-of-the-art models for visual cortical neurons. Cortical neurons in the primary visual cortex are sensitive to contextual information mediated by extensive horizontal and feedback connections. Standard CNNs integrate global contextual information to model contextual modulation via two mechanisms: successive convolutions and a fully connected readout layer. In this paper, we find that self-attention (SA), an implementation of non-local network mechanisms, can improve neural response predictions over parameter-matched CNNs in two key metrics: tuning curve correlation and peak tuning. We introduce peak tuning as a metric to evaluate a model's ability to capture a neuron's top feature preference. We factorize networks to assess each context mechanism, revealing that information in the local receptive field is most important for modeling overall tuning, but surround information is critically necessary for characterizing the tuning peak. We find that self-attention can replace posterior spatial-integration convolutions when learned incrementally, and is further enhanced in the presence of a fully connected readout layer, suggesting that the two context mechanisms are complementary. Finally, we find that decomposing receptive field learning and contextual modulation learning in an incremental manner may be an effective and robust mechanism for learning surround-center interactions",

Despite the success of DD methods for supervised learning, DD for self-supervised pre-training of deep models has remained unaddressed. Pre-training on unlabeled data is crucial for efficiently generalizing to downstream tasks with limited labeled data. In this work, we propose the first effective DD method for SSL pre-training. First, we show, theoretically and empirically, that naiive application of supervised DD methods to SSL fails, due to the high variance of the SSL gradient. Then, we address this issue by relying on insights from knowledge distillation (KD) literature. Specifically, we train a small student model to match the representations of a larger teacher model trained with SSL. Then, we generate a small synthetic dataset by matching the training trajectories of the student models. As the KD objective has considerably lower variance than SSL, our approach can generate synthetic datasets that can successfully pre-train high-quality encoders. Through extensive experiments, we show that our distilled sets lead to up to 13% higher accuracy than prior work, on a variety of downstream tasks, in the presence of limited labeled data.

We propose LEARN-BY-INTERACT, a data-centric framework to adapt LLM agents to any given environments without human annotations. LEARN-BY-INTERACT synthesizes trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories, a process called backward construction.

Extensive experiments on SWE-bench, WebArena, OSWorld, and Spider2-V spanning across realistic coding, web, and desktop environments show the effectiveness of LEARN-BY-INTERACT in various downstream agentic tasks — baseline results are improved up to 11.1% for ICL with Claude-3.5 and 23.1% for training with Codestral-22B. We further demonstrate the critical role of backward construction, which provides up to 10.6% improvement for training. Our ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency provided by our synthesized data in ICL and the superiority of our retrieval pipeline over alternative approaches like conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

However, current machine learning (ML) models designed to analyze these datasets often lack interpretability and identifiability guarantees, which are essential for biomedical research. Recent advances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying interpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees. Unfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on restrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification results, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a detailed understanding of the mechanisms. In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for multimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of biomedical datasets. Theoretically, we consider a nonparametric latent distribution (c.f., parametric assumptions in previous work) that allows for causal relationships across potentially different modalities. We establish identifiability guarantees for each latent component, extending the subspace identification results from previous work. Our key theoretical contribution is the structural sparsity of causal connections between modalities, which, as we will discuss, is natural for a large collection of biomedical systems. Empirically, we present a practical framework to instantiate our theoretical insights.

    "abstract": "An intriguing property of the Transformer is its ability to perform in-context learning (ICL), where the Transformer can solve different inference tasks without parameter updating based on the contextual information provided by the corresponding input-output demonstration pairs. It has been theoretically proved that ICL is enabled by the capability of Transformers to perform gradient-descent algorithms (Von Oswald et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2024). This work takes a step further and shows that Transformers can perform learning-to-optimize (L2O) algorithms. Specifically, for the ICL sparse recovery (formulated as LASSO) tasks, we show that a K-layer Transformer can perform an L2O algorithm with a provable convergence rate linear in K. This provides a new perspective explaining the superior ICL capability of Transformers, even with only a few layers, which cannot be achieved by the standard gradient-descent algorithms. Moreover, unlike the conventional L2O algorithms that require the measurement matrix involved in training to match that in testing, the trained Transformer is able to solve sparse recovery problems generated with different measurement matrices. Besides, Transformers as an L2O algorithm can leverage structural information embedded in the training tasks to accelerate its convergence during ICL, and generalize across different lengths of demonstration pairs, where conventional L2O algorithms typically struggle or fail. Such theoretical findings are supported by our experimental results",

    "abstract": "AI agents hold the potential to transform everyday life by helping humans achieve their goals. To do this successfully, agents need to be able to coordinate with novel partners without prior interaction, a setting known as zero-shot coordination (ZSC). Overcooked has become one of the most popular benchmarks for evaluating coordination capabilities of AI agents and learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the origins of ZSC challenges in Overcooked. We introduce a state augmentation mechanism which mixes states that might be encountered when paired with unknown partners into the training distribution, reducing the out-of-distribution challenge associated with ZSC. We show that independently trained agents under this algorithm coordinate successfully in Overcooked. Our results suggest that ZSC failure can largely be attributed to poor state coverage under self-play rather than more sophisticated coordination challenges. The Overcooked environment is therefore not suitable as a ZSC benchmark. To address these shortcomings, we introduce OvercookedV2, a new version of the benchmark, which includes asymmetric information and stochasticity, facilitating the creation of interesting ZSC scenarios. To validate OvercookedV2, we conduct experiments demonstrating that mere exhaustive state coverage is insufficient to coordinate well. Finally, we use OvercookedV2 to build a new range of coordination challenges, including ones that require test time protocol formation, and we demonstrate the need for new coordination algorithms that can adapt online. We hope that OvercookedV2 will help benchmark the next generation of ZSC algorithms and advance collaboration between AI agents and humans",

    "title": "TULIP: Token-length Upgraded CLIP",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We address the challenge of representing long captions in vision-language models, such as CLIP. By design these models are limited by fixed, absolute positional encodings, restricting inputs to a maximum of 77 tokens and hindering performance on tasks requiring longer descriptions. Although recent work has attempted to overcome this limit, their proposed approaches struggle to model token relationships over longer distances and simply extend to a fixed new token length. Instead, we propose a generalizable method, named TULIP, able to upgrade the token length to any length for CLIP-like models. We do so by improving the architecture with relative position encodings, followed by a training procedure that (i) distills the original CLIP text encoder into an encoder with relative position encodings and (ii) enhances the model for aligning longer captions with images. By effectively encoding captions longer than the default 77 tokens, our model outperforms baselines on cross-modal tasks such as retrieval and text-to-image generation.

    "abstract": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for task specialization but often becomes resource-intensive due to redundant or uninformative data. Existing data selection methods typically rely either on computationally expensive gradient-based metrics or static embeddings that fail to adapt dynamically to the model's evolving state, thus limiting their practical effectiveness. To address this, we propose DELIFT (Data Efficient Language model Instruction Fine-Tuning), leveraging a novel, computationally efficient utility metric inspired by In-Context Learning (ICL). Our ICL-based metric measures the informational value of each data sample by quantifying its effectiveness as an in-context example in improving model predictions for other samples, reflecting its actual contribution relative to the model's current state. Integrated with tailored submodular optimization methods, DELIFT systematically selects diverse, informative subsets optimized specifically for each fine-tuning stage: instruction tuning, task-specific adaptation, and continual fine-tuning. Experimental results across multiple datasets and model scales show DELIFT reduces fine-tuning data requirements by up to 70% without compromising performance, consistently outperforming existing methods by up to 26% in effectiveness and efficiency",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit *emergent abilities* in some downstream tasks, where model performance stagnates at first and then improves sharply and unpredictably with scale beyond a threshold. In this work, we investigate the phenomenon by grouping questions based on difficulty level and provide a possible explanation for emergent abilities. Specifically, we observe U-shaped scaling for hard questions and inverted-U scaling followed by steady improvement for easy questions. The two scaling patterns initially offset each other, causing stagnant overall performance. The performance starts to soar when the scaling pattern of easy questions reverts from inverse to standard scaling, leading to emergent abilities. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet effective pipeline, called *Slice-and-Sandwich*, to predict the emergence threshold and model performance beyond the threshold.

    "abstract": "Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, breaking text into units that computational models can process. While learned subword tokenizers have become the de-facto standard, they present challenges such as large vocabularies, limited adaptability to new domains or languages, and sensitivity to spelling errors and variations. To overcome these limitations, we investigate a hierarchical architecture for autoregressive language modelling that combines character-level and word-level processing. It employs a lightweight character-level encoder to convert character sequences into word embeddings, which are then processed by a word-level backbone model and decoded back into characters via a compact character-level decoder. This method retains the sequence compression benefits of word-level tokenization without relying on a rigid, predefined vocabulary. We demonstrate, at scales up to 7 billion parameters, that hierarchical transformers match the downstream task performance of subword-tokenizer-based models while exhibiting significantly greater robustness to input perturbations. Additionally, during continued pretraining on an out-of-domain language, our model trains almost twice as fast, achieves superior performance on the target language, and retains more of its previously learned knowledge. Hierarchical transformers pave the way for NLP systems that are more robust, flexible, and generalizable across languages and domains",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We explore a class of adversarial attacks targeting the activations of language models to derive upper-bound scaling laws on their attack susceptibility. By manipulating a relatively small subset of model activations, $a$, we demonstrate the ability to control the exact prediction of a significant number (in some cases up to 1000) of subsequent tokens $t$. We empirically verify a scaling law where the maximum number of target tokens predicted, $t_\\mathrm{max}$, depends linearly on the number of tokens $a$ whose activations the attacker controls as $t_\\mathrm{max} = \\kappa a$. We find that the number of bits the attacker controls on the input to exert a single bit of control on the output (a property we call \\textit{attack resistance $\\chi$}) is remarkably stable between $\\approx 16$ and $\\approx 25$ over orders of magnitude of model sizes and between model families. Compared to attacks directly on input tokens, attacks on activations are predictably much stronger, however, we identify a surprising regularity where one bit of input steered either via activations or via tokens is able to exert a surprisingly similar amount of control over the model predictions. This gives support for the hypothesis that adversarial attacks are a consequence of dimensionality mismatch between the input and output spaces. A practical implication of the ease of attacking language model activations instead of tokens is for multi-modal and selected retrieval models. By using language models as a controllable test-bed to study adversarial attacks, we explored input-output dimension regimes that are inaccessible in computer vision and greatly extended the empirical support for the dimensionality theory of adversarial attacks",

    "abstract": "Early Exit (EE) techniques have emerged as a means to reduce inference latency in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The latency improvement and accuracy in these techniques crucially depend on the criteria used to make exit decisions. We propose a new decision criterion BEEM where exit classifiers are treated as experts and aggregate their confidence scores. The confidence scores are aggregated only if neighbouring experts are consistent in prediction as the samples pass through them, thus capturing their ensemble effect. A sample exits when the aggregated confidence value exceeds a threshold. The threshold is set using the error rates of the intermediate exits aiming to surpass the performance of conventional DNN inference. Experimental results on the COCO dataset for Image captioning and GLUE datasets for various language tasks demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of state-of-the-art EE methods, achieving improvements in speed-up by a factor $1.5\\times$ to $2.1\\times$.

Existing techniques for solving such inverse problems rely on traditional optimization methods, which are slow and computationally expensive, limiting iteration speed and design exploration. Neural networks would seem to offer a solution via data-driven amortized optimization, but they often require extensive fine-tuning and cannot ensure that important design criteria, such as mechanical integrity, are met. In this work, we combine neural networks with a differentiable mechanics simulator to develop a model that accelerates the solution of shape approximation problems for architectural structures represented as bar systems. This model explicitly guarantees compliance with mechanical constraints while generating designs that closely match target geometries. We validate our approach in two tasks, the design of masonry shells and cable-net towers. Our model achieves better accuracy and generalization than fully neural alternatives, and comparable accuracy to direct optimization but in real time, enabling fast and reliable design exploration.

Leveraging this localized pattern, we propose a novel decoding strategy inspired by the momentum analogy used in gradient descent-based optimizers.

Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement.

    "abstract": "Human capabilities in understanding visual relations are far superior to those of AI systems, especially for previously unseen objects. For example, while AI systems struggle to determine whether two such objects are visually the same or different, humans can do so with ease. Active vision theories postulate that the learning of visual relations is grounded in actions that we take to fixate objects and their parts by moving our eyes. In particular, the low-dimensional spatial information about the corresponding eye movements is hypothesized to facilitate the representation of relations between different image parts. Inspired by these theories, we develop a system equipped with a novel Glimpse-based Active Perception (GAP) that sequentially glimpses at the most salient regions of the input image and processes them at high resolution. Importantly, our system leverages the locations stemming from the glimpsing actions, along with the visual content around them, to represent relations between different parts of the image. The results suggest that the GAP is essential for extracting visual relations that go beyond the immediate visual content. Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance on several visual reasoning tasks being more sample-efficient, and generalizing better to out-of-distribution visual inputs than prior models",

To circumvent this limitation and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation, we introduce the Massive Multilingual Text Embedding Benchmark (MMTEB) -- a large-scale community-driven initiative expanding MTEB to over 500 quality-controlled evaluation tasks across 1,000+ languages. MMTEB includes a wide range of challenging novel tasks such as instruction following, long-document retrieval, and code retrieval, and represents the largest multilingual collection of evaluation tasks for embedding models to date. We use this collection to construct multiple highly multilingual benchmarks. We evaluate a representative set of models on these benchmarks. Our findings indicate that, while LLM-based models can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a subset of languages, the best-performing publicly available model across languages is the notably smaller, multilingual-e5-large-instruct. Massive benchmarks often impose high computational demands, limiting accessibility, particularly for low-resource communities. To address this, we downsample tasks based on inter-task correlation (i.e., selecting only a diverse set of tasks) while preserving relative rankings. We further optimize tasks such as retrieval by sampling hard negatives, creating smaller but effective splits.

    "abstract": "We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures",

However, token-level RLHF suffers from the credit assignment problem over long sequences, where delayed rewards make it challenging for the model to discern which actions contributed to preferred outcomes. This hinders learning efficiency and slows convergence.In this paper, we propose MA-RLHF, a simple yet effective RLHF framework that incorporates macro actions --- sequences of tokens or higher-level language constructs --- into the learning process.

While numerous interpretability methods have been developed for unimodal tasks, these approaches often fail to transfer effectively to multimodal contexts due to inherent differences in the representation structures.

During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The success of modern machine learning is due in part to the adaptive optimization methods that have been developed to deal with the difficulties of training large models over complex datasets. One such method is gradient clipping: a practical procedure with limited theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we study clipping in a least squares problem under streaming SGD. We develop a theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics in the limit of large intrinsic dimension—a model and dataset dependent notion of dimensionality. In this limit we find a deterministic equation that describes the evolution of the loss and demonstrate that this equation predicts the path of clipped SGD on synthetic, CIFAR10, and Wikitext2 data. We show that with Gaussian noise clipping cannot improve SGD performance. Yet, in other noisy settings, clipping can provide benefits with tuning of the clipping threshold. We propose a simple heuristic for near optimal scheduling of the clipping threshold which requires the tuning of only one hyperparameter. We conclude with a discussion about the links between high-dimensional clipping and neural network training",

    "abstract": "Transporting between arbitrary distributions is a fundamental goal in generative modeling. Recently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to obtain in practice. Furthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching (DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space. Our approach extends Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its convergence to the SB. Furthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph transformation, and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost function described by the graph edit distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field of chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes molecules' property-of-interest with minimal graph transformation, successfully retaining other features.

    "title": "Breaking Mental Set to Improve Reasoning through Diverse Multi-Agent Debate",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen significant progress but continue to struggle with persistent reasoning mistakes. Previous methods of *self-reflection* have been proven limited due to the models' inherent fixed thinking patterns. While Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) attempts to mitigate this by incorporating multiple agents, it often employs the same reasoning methods, even though assigning different personas to models. This leads to a \"fixed mental set\", where models rely on homogeneous thought processes without exploring alternative perspectives. In this paper, we introduce Diverse Multi-Agent Debate (DMAD), a method that encourages agents to think with distinct reasoning approaches. By leveraging diverse problem-solving strategies, each agent can gain insights from different perspectives, refining its responses through discussion and collectively arriving at the optimal solution. DMAD effectively breaks the limitations of fixed mental sets. We evaluate DMAD against various prompting techniques, including *self-reflection* and traditional MAD, across multiple benchmarks using both LLMs and Multimodal LLMs. Our experiments show that DMAD consistently outperforms other methods, delivering better results than MAD in fewer rounds.

    "abstract": "Model robustness is essential for ensuring the stability and reliability of machine learning systems. Despite extensive research on various aspects of model robustness, such as adversarial robustness and label noise robustness, the exploration of robustness towards different resolutions, remains less explored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel form of attack: the resolution attack. This attack aims to deceive both classifiers and human observers by generating images that exhibit different semantics across different resolutions. To implement the resolution attack, we propose an automated framework capable of generating dual-semantic images in a zero-shot manner. Specifically, we leverage large-scale diffusion models for their comprehensive ability to construct images and propose a staged denoising strategy to achieve a smoother transition across resolutions. Through the proposed framework, we conduct resolution attacks against various off-the-shelf classifiers. The experimental results exhibit high attack success rate, which not only validates the effectiveness of our proposed framework but also reveals the vulnerability of current classifiers towards different resolutions. Additionally, our framework, which incorporates features from two distinct objects, serves as a competitive tool for applications such as face swapping and facial camouflage.

    "title": "SLMRec: Distilling Large Language Models into Small for Sequential Recommendation",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Sequential Recommendation (SR) task involves predicting the next item a user is likely to interact with, given their past interactions. The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation. Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene. Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily. In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets. Surprisingly, our motivational experiments reveal that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, indicating that pruning the remaining layers can still maintain strong performance. Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method. Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13\\% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively. Besides, we provide a theoretical justification for why small language models can perform comparably to large language models in SR",

    "abstract": "Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting input graph data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance performance; (3) LLMs employ diverse potential algorithms to solve one task, with performance varying based on their execution capabilities",

    "abstract": "Developing agents for complex and underspecified tasks, where no clear objective exists, remains challenging but offers many opportunities. This is especially true in video games, where simulated players (bots) need to play realistically, and there is no clear reward to evaluate them. While imitation learning has shown promise in such domains, these methods often fail when agents encounter out-of-distribution scenarios during deployment. Expanding the training dataset is a common solution, but it becomes impractical or costly when relying on human demonstrations. This article addresses active imitation learning, aiming to trigger expert intervention only when necessary, reducing the need for constant expert input along training. We introduce Random Network Distillation DAgger (RND-DAgger), a new active imitation learning method that limits expert querying by using a learned state-based out-of-distribution measure to trigger interventions. This approach avoids frequent expert-agent action comparisons, thus making the expert intervene only when it is useful. We evaluate RND-DAgger against traditional imitation learning and other active approaches in 3D video games (racing and third-person navigation) and in a robotic locomotion task and show that RND-DAgger surpasses previous methods by reducing expert queries. https://sites.google.com/view/rnd-dagger",

    "abstract": "A grand challenge in biology is to discover evolutionary traits---features of organisms common to a group of species with a shared ancestor in the tree of life (also referred to as phylogenetic tree). With the growing availability of image repositories in biology, there is a tremendous opportunity to discover evolutionary traits directly from images in the form of a hierarchy of prototypes. However, current prototype-based methods are mostly designed to operate over a flat structure of classes and face several challenges in discovering hierarchical prototypes, including the issue of learning over-specific prototypes at internal nodes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the framework of Hierarchy aligned Commonality through Prototypical Networks (HComP-Net). The key novelties in HComP-Net include a novel over-specificity loss to avoid learning over-specific prototypes, a novel discriminative loss to ensure prototypes at an internal node are absent in the contrasting set of species with different ancestry, and a novel masking module to allow for the exclusion of over-specific prototypes at higher levels of the tree without hampering classification performance. We empirically show that HComP-Net learns prototypes that are accurate, semantically consistent, and generalizable to unseen species in comparison to baselines.

Specifically, we utilize local data influence of synthetic training data points on students to characterize students' learning preferences. Then, we train the teacher model with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to generate synthetic data tailored toward student learning preferences.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the first systematic study of evaluating Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) designed to forecast the evolution of stochastic complex systems. We show that traditional evaluation methods like threshold-based classification metrics and error-based scoring rules assess a DNN's ability to replicate the observed ground truth but fail to measure the DNN's learning of the underlying stochastic process. To address this gap, we propose a new evaluation criteria called _Fidelity to Stochastic Process (F2SP)_, representing the DNN's ability to predict the system property _Statistic-GT_—the ground truth of the stochastic process—and introduce an evaluation metric that exclusively assesses F2SP. We formalize F2SP within a stochastic framework and establish criteria for validly measuring it. We formally show that Expected Calibration Error (ECE) satisfies the necessary condition for testing F2SP, unlike traditional evaluation methods. Empirical experiments on synthetic datasets, including wildfire, host-pathogen, and stock market models, demonstrate that ECE uniquely captures F2SP. We further extend our study to real-world wildfire data, highlighting the limitations of conventional evaluation and discuss the practical utility of incorporating F2SP into model assessment.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have predominantly leveraged neural network policies for decision-making, yet these models often lack interpretability, posing challenges for stakeholder comprehension and trust. Concept bottleneck models offer an interpretable alternative by integrating human-understandable concepts into policies. However, prior work assumes that concept annotations are readily available during training. For RL, this requirement poses a significant limitation: it necessitates continuous real-time concept annotation, which either places an impractical burden on human annotators or incurs substantial costs in API queries and inference time when employing automated labeling methods. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel training scheme that enables RL agents to efficiently learn a concept-based policy by only querying annotators to label a small set of data. Our algorithm, LICORICE, involves three main contributions: interleaving concept learning and RL training, using an ensemble to actively select informative data points for labeling, and decorrelating the concept data. We show how LICORICE reduces human labeling efforts to 500 or fewer concept labels in three environments, and 5000 or fewer in two more complex environments, all at no cost to performance. We also explore the use of VLMs as automated concept annotators, finding them effective in some cases but imperfect in others. Our work significantly reduces the annotation burden for interpretable RL, making it more practical for real-world applications that necessitate transparency. Our code is released",

Upon receiving a query, KGARevion generates relevant triplets by leveraging the latent knowledge embedded in a large language model. It then verifies these triplets against a grounded knowledge graph, filtering out errors and retaining only accurate, contextually relevant information for the final answer. This multi-step process strengthens reasoning, adapts to different models of medical inference, and outperforms retrieval-augmented generation-based approaches that lack effective verification mechanisms. Evaluations on medical QA benchmarks show that KGARevion improves accuracy by over 5.2% over 15 models in handling complex medical queries. To further assess its effectiveness, we curated three new medical QA datasets with varying levels of semantic complexity, where KGARevion improved accuracy by 10.4%. The agent integrates with different LLMs and biomedical knowledge graphs for broad applicability across knowledge-intensive tasks.

    "abstract": "Decision-making agents based on pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed across various domains of human activity. While their applications are currently rather specialized, several research efforts are underway to develop more generalist agents. As LLM-based systems become more agentic, their influence on human activity will grow and their transparency will decrease. Consequently, developing effective methods for aligning them to human values is vital. The prevailing practice in alignment often relies on human preference data (e.g., in RLHF or DPO), in which values are implicit, opaque and are essentially deduced from relative preferences over different model outputs. In this work, instead of relying on human feedback, we introduce the design of reward functions that explicitly and transparently encode core human values for Reinforcement Learning-based fine-tuning of foundation agent models. Specifically, we use intrinsic rewards for the moral alignment of LLM agents. We evaluate our approach using the traditional philosophical frameworks of Deontological Ethics and Utilitarianism, quantifying moral rewards for agents in terms of actions and consequences on the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) environment. We also show how moral fine-tuning can be deployed to enable an agent to unlearn a previously developed selfish strategy. Finally, we find that certain moral strategies learned on the IPD game generalize to several other matrix game environments. In summary, we demonstrate that fine-tuning with intrinsic rewards is a promising general solution for aligning LLM agents to human values, and it might represent a more transparent and cost-effective alternative to currently predominant alignment techniques",

We introduce a new analytical framework via cross-domain *latent distribution matching* (LDM), which establishes content-style identifiability under substantially more relaxed conditions. Specifically, we show that restrictive assumptions such as component-wise independence of the latent variables can be removed. Most notably, we prove that prior knowledge of the content and style dimensions is not necessary for ensuring identifiability, if sparsity constraints are properly imposed onto the learned latent representations. Bypassing the knowledge of the exact latent dimension has been a longstanding aspiration in unsupervised representation learning---our analysis is the first to underpin its theoretical and practical viability.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In response to the call for agent-based solutions that leverage the ever-increasing capabilities of the deep models' ecosystem, we introduce a comprehensive solution for selecting appropriate models and subsequently planning a set of atomic actions to satisfy the end-users' instructions. Our system, Hive, operates over sets of models and, upon receiving natural language instructions, schedules and executes, explainable plans of atomic actions. These actions can involve one or more of the available models to achieve the overall task, while respecting end-users specific constraints. Hive is able to plan complex chains of actions while guaranteeing explainability, using an LLM-based formal logic backbone empowered by PDDL operations. We introduce the MuSE benchmark in order to offer a comprehensive evaluation of the multi-modal capabilities of agent systems. Our findings show that our framework redefines the state-of-the-art for task selection, outperforming other competing systems that plan operations across multiple models while offering transparency guarantees while fully adhering to user constraints",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are thriving through continuous fine-tuning by LLMs. Driven by the law that \"scale is everything\", MLLMs expand their training sets during version iterations. In this paper, we propose a large-scale training data engine built around an evaluating-exploring-evolving (E3) loop. Evaluating the data provides insights into its characteristics. Exploring quality rules helps identify which data enhances training. Together, these processes facilitate the systematic evolution of new, high-quality data. With the E3 loop, we introduce ZooProbe, an efficient data engine for MLLMs. First, the problem of data expansion is formalized as a tree of sampling and growth. ZooProbe introduces a small-scale model *zoo* to obtain comprehensive evaluations for child datasets. From multiple perspectives, visual, textual, and multimodal models cover over 50 dimensions of intrinsic and meta attributes, such as object and topic distribution, and higher-level properties, like annotation quality and scene complexity. ZooProbe constructs based on A$^\\star$ search, modeling the heuristic function as a quality estimate from data evaluation results. It dynamically explores the rule of data quality based on the model state of the *probe* datasets. Additionally, it evolves new targeted data with identified high-quality rules. We also develop an extra heuristic quality ranker with the data utilized and discarded during the expansion. Our experiments show that ZooProbe significantly breaks the scaling law in multimodal instruction fine-tuning at scales of 260$k$ and below. ZooProbe generates high-quality data that accelerates MLLM training and enhances performance, automating the evolution of large-scale training data",

    "title": "Wicked Oddities: Selectively Poisoning for Effective Clean-Label Backdoor Attacks",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a type of adversarial attack that poisons the training data to manipulate the behavior of models trained on such data. Clean-label backdoor is a more stealthy form of backdoor attacks that can perform the attack without changing the labels of poisoned data. Early works on clean-label attacks added triggers to a random subset of the training set, ignoring the fact that samples contribute unequally to the attack's success. This results in high poisoning rates and low attack success rates. To alleviate the problem, several supervised learning-based sample selection strategies have been proposed. However, these methods assume access to the entire labeled training set and require training, which is expensive and may not always be practical. This work studies a new and more practical (but also more challenging) threat model where the attacker only provides data for the target class (e.g., in face recognition systems) and has no knowledge of the victim model or any other classes in the training set. We study different strategies for selectively poisoning a small set of training samples in the target class to boost the attack success rate in this setting. Our threat model poses a serious threat in training machine learning models with third-party datasets, since the attack can be performed effectively with limited information. Experiments on benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of our strategies in improving clean-label backdoor attacks",

    "abstract": "$D^2$-sampling is a fundamental component of sampling-based clustering algorithms such as $k$-means++. Given a dataset $V \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ with $N$ points and a center set $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$, $D^2$-sampling refers to picking a point from $V$ where the sampling probability of a point is proportional to its squared distance from the nearest center in $C$. The popular $k$-means++ algorithm is simply a $k$-round $D^2$-sampling process, which runs in $O(Nkd)$ time and gives $O(\\log{k})$-approximation in expectation for the $k$-means problem. In this work, we give a quantum algorithm for (approximate) $D^2$-sampling in the QRAM model that results in a quantum implementation of $k$-means++ with a running time $\\tilde{O}(\\zeta^2 k^2)$. Here $\\zeta$ is the aspect ratio ( i.e., largest to smallest interpoint distance) and $\\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $N, d, k$. It can be shown through a robust approximation analysis of $k$-means++ that the quantum version preserves its $O(\\log{k})$ approximation guarantee. Further, we show that our quantum algorithm for $D^2$-sampling can be dequantized using the sample-query access model of Tang (PhD Thesis, Ewin Tang, University of Washington, 2023). This results in a fast quantum-inspired classical implementation of $k$-means++, which we call QI-$k$-means++, with a running time $O(Nd) + \\tilde{O}(\\zeta^2k^2d)$, where the $O(Nd)$ term is for setting up the sample-query access data structure. Experimental investigations show promising results for QI-$k$-means++ on large datasets with bounded aspect ratio. Finally, we use our quantum $D^2$-sampling with the known $ D^2$-sampling-based classical approximation scheme to obtain the first quantum approximation scheme for the $k$-means problem with polylogarithmic running time dependence on $N$",

Traditionally, IRL is treated as an adversarial game, where an adversary searches over reward models, and a learner optimizes the reward through repeated RL procedures. This game-solving approach is both computationally expensive and difficult to stabilize. In this work, we propose a novel approach to IRL by _direct policy search_: by exploiting a linear factorization of the return as the inner product of successor features and a reward vector, we design an IRL algorithm by policy gradient descent on the gap between the learner and expert features. Our non-adversarial method does not require learning an explicit reward function and can be solved seamlessly with existing RL algorithms. Remarkably, our approach works in state-only settings without expert action labels, a setting which behavior cloning (BC) cannot solve. Empirical results demonstrate that our method learns from as few as a single expert demonstration and achieves improved performance on various control tasks",

    "title": "SOAP: Improving and Stabilizing Shampoo using Adam for Language Modeling",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "There is growing evidence of the effectiveness of Shampoo, a higher-order preconditioning method, over Adam in deep learning optimization tasks. However, Shampoo's drawbacks include additional hyperparameters and computational overhead when compared to Adam, which only updates running averages of first- and second-moment quantities. This work establishes a formal connection between Shampoo (implemented with the 1/2 power) and Adafactor --- a memory-efficient approximation of Adam --- showing that Shampoo is equivalent to running Adafactor in the eigenbasis of Shampoo's preconditioner. This insight leads to the design of a simpler and computationally efficient algorithm: **S**hampo**O** with **A**dam in the **P**reconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP). With regards to improving Shampoo's computational efficiency, the most straightforward approach would be to simply compute Shampoo's eigendecomposition less frequently. Unfortunately, as our empirical results show, this leads to performance degradation that worsens with this frequency. SOAP mitigates this degradation by continually updating the running average of the second moment, just as Adam does, but in the current (slowly changing) coordinate basis. Furthermore, since SOAP is equivalent to running Adam in a rotated space, it introduces only one additional hyperparameter (the preconditioning frequency) compared to Adam. We empirically evaluate SOAP on language model pre-training with 360m and 660m sized models. In the large batch regime, SOAP reduces the number of iterations by over 40\\% and wall clock time by over 35\\% compared to AdamW, with approximately 20\\% improvements in both metrics compared to Shampoo.

    "abstract": "Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a \"bag of words\". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.

    "abstract": "The growth in the number of parameters of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a significant surge in computational requirements, making them challenging and costly to deploy. Speculative decoding (SD) leverages smaller models to efficiently propose future tokens, which are then verified by the LLM in parallel. Small models that utilise activations from the LLM currently achieve the fastest decoding speeds. However, we identify several limitations of SD models including the lack of on-policyness during training and partial observability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a more grounded architecture for small models by introducing a Mixture of Attentions for SD. Our novel architecture can be applied in two scenarios: a conventional single device deployment and a novel client-server deployment where the small model is hosted on a consumer device and the LLM on a server. In a single-device scenario, we demonstrate state-of-the-art speedups improving EAGLE-2 by 9.5% and its acceptance length by 25%. In a client-server setting, our experiments demonstrate: 1) state-of-the-art latencies with minimal calls to the server for different network conditions, and 2) in the event of a complete disconnection, our approach can maintain higher accuracy compared to other SD methods and demonstrates advantages over API calls to LLMs, which would otherwise be unable to continue the generation process",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a versatile set of tasks. A key challenge in accelerating VLMs is storing and accessing the large Key-Value (KV) cache that encodes long visual contexts, such as images or videos. While existing KV cache compression methods are effective for Large Language Models (LLMs), directly migrating them to VLMs yields suboptimal accuracy and speedup. To bridge the gap, we propose VL-Cache, a novel KV cache compression recipe tailored for accelerating VLM inference. In this paper, we first investigate the unique sparsity pattern of VLM attention by distinguishing visual and text tokens in prefill and decoding phases. Based on these observations, we introduce a layer-adaptive sparsity-aware cache budget allocation method that effectively distributes the limited cache budget across different layers, further reducing KV cache size without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we develop a modality-aware token scoring policy to better evaluate the token importance. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that retaining only 10% of KV cache achieves accuracy comparable to that with full cache. In a speed benchmark, our method accelerates end-to-end latency of generating 100 tokens by up to 2.33x and speeds up decoding by up to 7.08x, while reducing the memory footprint of KV cache in GPU by 90%",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Contextual semantic information plays a pivotal role in the brain's visual interpretation of the surrounding environment. When processing visual information, electrical signals within synapses facilitate the dynamic activation and deactivation of synaptic connections, guided by the contextual semantic information associated with different objects. In the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), neural networks have emerged as powerful tools to emulate complex signaling systems, enabling tasks such as classification and segmentation by understanding visual information. However, conventional neural networks have limitations in simulating the conditional activation and deactivation of synapses, collectively known as the connectome, a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain. Additionally, the pixel-wise inference mechanism of conventional neural networks failed to account for the explicit utilization of contextual semantic information in the prediction process. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel neural network, dubbed the Shape Memory Network (SMN), which excels in two key areas: (1) faithfully emulating the intricate mechanism of the brain's connectome, and (2) explicitly incorporating contextual semantic information during the inference process. The SMN memorizes the structure suitable for contextual semantic information and leverages this structure at the inference phase. The structural transformation emulates the conditional activation and deactivation of synaptic connections within the connectome. Rigorous experimentation carried out across a range of semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrated the outstanding performance of the SMN, highlighting its superiority and effectiveness. Furthermore, our pioneering network on connectome emulation reveals the immense potential of the SMN for next-generation neural networks",

GCNNs have been designed for a variety of geometric transformations from 2D and 3D rotation groups, to semi-groups such as scale. Despite the improved interpretability, accuracy and generalizability of these architectures, GCNNs have seen limited application in the context of perceptual quantities. Notably, the recent CEConv network uses a GCNN to achieve equivariance to hue transformations by convolving input images with a hue rotated RGB filter. However, this approach leads to invalid RGB values which break equivariance and degrade performance. We resolve these issues with a lifting layer that transforms the input image directly, thereby circumventing the issue of invalid RGB values and improving equivariance error by over three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we extend the notion of color equivariance to include equivariance to saturation and luminance shift. Our hue-, saturation-, luminance- and color-equivariant networks achieve strong generalization to out-of-distribution perceptual variations and improved sample efficiency over conventional architectures.

However, existing abstraction methods either discover skills in an unsupervised manner, which often lacks semantic information and leads to erroneous or scattered skill extraction results, or require substantial human intervention. In this work, we propose to leverage the extensive knowledge in pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to progressively guide the latent space after vector quantization to be more semantically meaningful through relabeling each skill.

By leveraging the rich information in VLMs, our method can significantly outperform existing offline RL approaches that depend only on limited training data. From a theory perspective, we demonstrate that stronger internal sequential correlations within each sub-task, induced by VanTA, effectively reduces suboptimality in policy learning. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on diverse environments, including Franka Kitchen, Minigrid, and Crafter.

However, training to maximize human feedback creates a perverse incentive structure for the AI to resort to manipulative or deceptive tactics to obtain positive feedback from users who are vulnerable to such strategies. We study this phenomenon by training LLMs with Reinforcement Learning with simulated user feedback in environments of practical LLM usage. In our settings, we find that: 1) Extreme forms of \"feedback gaming\" such as manipulation and deception are learned reliably; 2) Even if only 2% of users are vulnerable to manipulative strategies, LLMs learn to identify and target them while behaving appropriately with other users, making such behaviors harder to detect; 3) To mitigate this issue, it may seem promising to leverage continued safety training or LLM-as-judges during training to filter problematic outputs. Instead, we found that while such approaches help in some of our settings, they backfire in others, sometimes even leading to subtler manipulative behaviors. We hope our results can serve as a case study which highlights the risks of using gameable feedback sources -- such as user feedback -- as a target for RL. Our code is publicly available.

We further propose a novel representation, face radial curves, of a 3D face as a set of functions and then utilize our proposed GDP functional data mechanism. To preserve the shape of the face while injecting noise we rely on tools from shape analysis for our novel representation of the face. We show that our method preserves the shape of the average face and injects less noise than traditional methods for the same privacy budget.

    "abstract": "We propose a general framework for a hybrid continuous-discrete algorithm that integrates continuous-time deterministic dynamics with Metropolis-Hastings (MH) steps to combine search dynamics that either preserve or break detailed balance. Our purpose is to study the non-equilibrium dynamics that leads to the ground state of rugged energy landscapes in this general setting. Our results show that MH-driven dynamics reach ``easy'' ground states more quickly, indicating a stronger bias toward these solutions in algorithms using reversible transition probabilities. To validate this, we construct a set of Ising problem instances with a controllable bias in the energy landscape that makes certain degenerate solutions more accessible than others. The constructed hybrid algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in convergence and ground-state sampling accuracy, achieving a 100x speedup on GPU compared to simulated annealing, making it well-suited for large-scale applications",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "We introduce the \"Belief State Transformer\", a next-token predictor that takes both a prefix and suffix as inputs, with a novel objective of predicting both the next token for the prefix and the previous token for the suffix. The Belief State Transformer effectively learns to solve challenging problems that conventional forward-only transformers struggle with, in a domain-independent fashion. Key to this success is learning a compact belief state that captures all relevant information necessary for accurate predictions. Empirical ablations show that each component of the model is essential in difficult scenarios where standard Transformers fall short. For the task of story writing with known prefixes and suffixes, our approach outperforms the Fill-in-the-Middle method for reaching known goals and demonstrates improved performance even when the goals are unknown. Altogether, the Belief State Transformer enables more efficient goal-conditioned decoding, better test-time inference, and high-quality text representations on small scale problems.

    "abstract": "Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data. Despite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes of well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest and first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities --- popular text, speech, and video datasets --- from their detailed sourcing trends and use restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608 languages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text, speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in dataset transparency and responsible use, we release our entire multimodal audit, allowing practitioners to trace data provenance across text, speech, and video",

Our work takes a step towards answering this question by performing the first large-scale benchmarking of deep video models on representational alignment to the human brain, using publicly available models and a recently released video brain imaging (fMRI) dataset. We disentangle four factors of variation in the models (temporal modeling, classification task, architecture, and training dataset) that affect alignment to the brain, which we measure by conducting Representational Similarity Analysis across multiple brain regions and model layers. We show that temporal modeling is key for alignment to brain regions involved in early visual processing, while a relevant classification task is key for alignment to higher-level regions. Moreover, we identify clear differences between the brain scoring patterns across layers of CNNs and Transformers, and reveal how training dataset biases transfer to alignment with functionally selective brain areas. Additionally, we uncover a negative correlation of computational complexity to brain alignment. Measuring a total of 99 neural networks and 10 human brains watching videos, we aim to forge a path that widens our understanding of temporal and semantic video representations in brains and machines, ideally leading towards more efficient video models and more mechanistic explanations of processing in the human brain",

    "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to optimize policies under pre-collected data, without requiring any further interactions with the environment. Derived from imitation learning, Behavior cloning (BC) is extensively utilized in offline RL for its simplicity and effectiveness. Although BC inherently avoids out-of-distribution deviations, it lacks the ability to discern between high and low-quality data, potentially leading to sub-optimal performance when facing with poor-quality data. Current offline RL algorithms attempt to enhance BC by incorporating value estimation, yet often struggle to effectively balance these two critical components, specifically the alignment between the behavior policy and the pre-trained value estimations under in-sample offline data. To address this challenge, we propose the Value-aligned Behavior Cloning via Bi-level Optimization (VACO), a novel bi-level framework that seamlessly integrates an inner loop for weighted supervised behavior cloning (BC) with an outer loop dedicated to value alignment. In this framework, the inner loop employs a meta-scoring network to evaluate and appropriately weight each training sample, while the outer loop maximizes value estimation for alignment with controlled noise to facilitate limited exploration. This bi-level structure allows VACO to identify the optimal weighted BC policy, ultimately maximizing the expected estimated return conditioned on the learned value function. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of VACO across a variety of continuous control benchmarks in offline RL, where it consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "Fugatto is a versatile audio synthesis and transformation model capable of following free-form text instructions with optional audio inputs. While large language models (LLMs) trained with text on a simple next-token prediction objective can learn to infer instructions directly from the data, models trained solely on audio data lack this capacity. This is because audio data does not inherently contain the instructions that were used to generate it. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a specialized dataset generation approach optimized for producing a wide range of audio generation and transformation tasks, ensuring the data reveals meaningful relationships between audio and language. Another challenge lies in achieving compositional abilities -- such as combining, interpolating between, or negating instructions -- using data alone. To address it, we propose ComposableART, an inference-time technique that extends classifier-free guidance to compositional guidance. It enables the seamless and flexible composition of instructions, leading to highly customizable audio outputs outside the training distribution. Our evaluations across a diverse set of tasks demonstrate that Fugatto performs competitively with specialized models, while ComposableART enhances its sonic palette and control over synthesis. Most notably, we highlight our framework's ability to execute emergent sounds and tasks -- sonic phenomena that transcend conventional audio generation -- unlocking new creative possibilities. \\href{https://fugatto.github.io/}{Demo Website.}",

The classical Deferred Acceptance algorithm merely produces an unfair stable marriage, providing optimal partners for one side while partially assigning pessimal partners to the other. Solving BSM is NP-hard, thwarting attempts to resolve the problem exactly. As the instance size increases in practice, recent studies have explored heuristics for finding a fair stable marriage but have not found an exact optimal solution for BSM efficiently. Nevertheless, in this paper we propose an efficient algorithm, Isorropia, that returns the exact optimal solution to practical BSM problem instances. Isorropia constructs two sets of candidate rotations from which it builds three sets of promising antichains, and performs local search on those three sets of promising antichains. Our extensive experimental study shows that Isorropia surpasses the time-efficiency of baselines that return the exact solution by up to three orders of magnitude",

    "title": "Addax: Utilizing Zeroth-Order Gradients to Improve Memory Efficiency and Performance of SGD for Fine-Tuning Language Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Fine-tuning language models (LMs) with the standard Adam optimizer often demands excessive memory, limiting accessibility. The ``in-place'' version of Stochastic Gradient Descent (IP-SGD) and Memory-Efficient Zeroth-order Optimizer (MeZO) have been proposed as solutions to improve memory efficiency. However, IP-SGD still requires a decent amount of memory, and MeZO suffers from slow convergence and degraded final performance due to its zeroth-order nature. This paper introduces Addax, a novel method that improves both memory efficiency and algorithm performance of IP-SGD by integrating it with MeZO. Specifically, Addax computes the zeroth-order or first-order gradient of the data points in the minibatch based on their memory consumption and combines zeroth- and first-order gradient estimates to obtain the updated direction in each step. By computing the zeroth-order order gradient of data points that require more memory and the first-order gradient of the ones that require less memory, Addax overcomes the slow convergence of MeZO and excessive memory requirement of IP-SGD. Additionally, the zeroth-order gradient acts as a regularizer for the first-order gradient, further enhancing the model's final performance. Theoretically, we establish the convergence of Addax under mild assumptions, demonstrating faster convergence and less restrictive hyper-parameter choices than MeZO. Our extensive experiments with diverse LMs and tasks show that Addax consistently outperforms MeZO in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while having a comparable memory footprint. In particular, our experiments using one A100 GPU on OPT-13B model reveal that, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in terms of accuracy/F1 score by 14%, and runs $15\\times$ faster, while having a comparable memory footprint to MeZO. In our experiments on the larger OPT-30B model, on average, Addax outperforms MeZO in terms of accuracy/F1 score by >16% and runs $30\\times$ faster on a single H100 GPU. Moreover, Addax surpasses the performance of standard fine-tuning approaches, such as IP-SGD and Adam, in most tasks in terms of Accuracy/F1 score with significantly less memory requirement",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning continues to be a critical challenge in large language model (LLM) development with significant interest. However, most of the cutting-edge progress in mathematical reasoning with LLMs has become closed-source due to lack of access to training data. This lack of data access limits researchers from understanding the impact of different choices for synthesizing and utilizing the data. With the goal of creating a high-quality finetuning (SFT) dataset for math reasoning, we conduct careful ablation experiments on data synthesis using the recently released Llama3.1 family of models. Our experiments show that: (a) solution format matters, with excessively verbose solutions proving detrimental to SFT performance, (b) data generated by a strong teacher outperforms on-policy data generated by a weak student model, (c) SFT is robust to low-quality solutions, allowing for imprecise data filtering, and (d) question diversity is crucial for achieving data scaling gains. Based on these insights, we create the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset which consists of 14M question-solution pairs (≈ 600K unique questions), making it nearly eight times larger than the previous largest open-source math reasoning dataset. Finetuning the Llama-3.1-8B-Base using OpenMathInstruct-2 outperforms Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on MATH by an absolute 15.9% (51.9% → 67.8%).

At the inference stage, MAPS integrates the simulation language description of the input diagram provided by PPM and results obtained through a Chain-of-Simulation process with MLLM to derive the underlying rationale and the final answer. Validated using our collected college-level circuit analysis problems, MAPS significantly improves reasoning accuracy of MLLM and outperforms all existing models.

    "abstract": "The influence of contextual input on the behavior of large language models (LLMs) has prompted the development of context attribution methods that aim to quantify each context span's effect on an LLM's generations. The leave-one-out (LOO) error, which measures the change in the likelihood of the LLM's response when a given span of the context is removed, provides a principled way to perform context attribution, but can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large models. In this work, we introduce AttriBoT, a series of novel techniques for efficiently computing an approximation of the LOO error for context attribution. Specifically, AttriBoT uses cached activations to avoid redundant operations, performs hierarchical attribution to reduce computation, and emulates the behavior of large target models with smaller proxy models. Taken together, AttriBoT can provide a 300x speedup while remaining more faithful to a target model's LOO error than prior context attribution methods. This stark increase in performance makes computing context attributions for a given response $30\\times$ faster than generating the response itself, empowering real-world applications that require computing attributions at scale. We release a user-friendly and efficient implementation of AttriBoT to enable efficient LLM interpretability as well as encourage future development of efficient context attribution methods",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Learning long-term behaviors in chaotic dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows and climate modelling, is challenging due to their inherent instability and unpredictability. These systems exhibit positive Lyapunov exponents, which significantly hinder accurate long-term forecasting. As a result, understanding long-term statistical behavior is far more valuable than focusing on short-term accuracy. While autoregressive deep sequence models have been applied to capture long-term behavior, they often lead to exponentially increasing errors in learned dynamics. To address this, we shift the focus from simple prediction errors to preserving an invariant measure in dissipative chaotic systems. These systems have attractors, where trajectories settle, and the invariant measure is the probability distribution on attractors that remains unchanged under dynamics. Existing methods generate long trajectories of dissipative chaotic systems by aligning invariant measures, but it is not always possible to obtain invariant measures for arbitrary datasets. We propose the Poincaré Flow Neural Network (PFNN), a novel operator learning framework designed to capture behaviors of chaotic systems without any explicit knowledge of the invariant measure. PFNN employs an auto-encoder to map the chaotic system to a finite-dimensional feature space, effectively linearizing the chaotic evolution. It then learns the linear evolution operators to match the physical dynamics by addressing two critical properties in dissipative chaotic systems: (1) contraction, the system's convergence toward its attractors, and (2) measure invariance, trajectories on the attractors following a probability distribution invariant to the dynamics. Our experiments on a variety of chaotic systems, including Lorenz systems, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and Navier–Stokes equation, demonstrate that PFNN has more accurate predictions and physical statistics compared to competitive baselines including the Fourier Neural Operator and the Markov Neural Operator",

Existing approaches, such as backdoor watermarking, rely on inducing a detectable behavior into the trained model on a part of the data distribution. However, these approaches have limitations, as they can be harmful to the model's performances or require unpractical access to the model's internals. Most importantly, previous approaches lack guarantee against false positives.\\ This paper introduces *data taggants*, a novel non-backdoor dataset ownership verification technique. Our method uses pairs of out-of-distribution samples and random labels as secret *keys*, and leverages clean-label targeted data poisoning to subtly alter a dataset, so that models trained on it respond to the key samples with the corresponding key labels. The keys are built as to allow for statistical certificates with black-box access only to the model.\\ We validate our approach through comprehensive and realistic experiments on ImageNet1k using ViT and ResNet models with state-of-the-art training recipes.

By running 16 modern CATE models across 43,200 datasets, we find that: (a) 62\\% of CATE estimates have a higher Mean Squared Error (MSE) than a trivial zero-effect predictor, rendering them ineffective; (b) in datasets with at least one useful CATE estimate, 80\\% still have higher MSE than a constant-effect model; and (c) Orthogonality-based models outperform other models only 30\\% of the time, despite widespread optimism about their performance. These findings expose significant limitations in current CATE models and suggest ample opportunities for further research. Our findings stem from a novel application of \\textit{observational sampling}, originally developed to evaluate Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimates from observational methods with experiment data. To adapt observational sampling for CATE evaluation, we introduce a statistical parameter, $Q$, equal to MSE minus a constant and preserves the ranking of models by their MSE. We then derive a family of sample statistics, collectively called $\\hat{Q}$, that can be computed from real-world data. We prove that $\\hat{Q}$ is a consistent estimator of $Q$ under mild technical conditions. When used in observational sampling, $\\hat{Q}$ is unbiased and asymptotically selects the model with the smallest MSE. To ensure the benchmark reflects real-world heterogeneity, we handpick datasets where outcomes come from field rather than simulation. By combining the new observational sampling method, new statistics, and real-world datasets, the benchmark provides a unique perspective on CATE estimator performance and uncover gaps in capturing real-world heterogeneity",

    "abstract": "Text-rich visual understanding—the ability to interpret both textual content and visual elements within a scene—is crucial for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to effectively interact with structured environments. We propose leveraging webpage UIs as a naturally structured and diverse data source to enhance MLLMs' capabilities in this area. Existing approaches, such as rule-based extraction, multimodal model captioning, and rigid HTML parsing, are hindered by issues like noise, hallucinations, and limited generalization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MultiUI, a dataset of 7.3 million samples spanning various UI types and tasks, structured using enhanced accessibility trees and task taxonomies. By scaling multimodal instructions from web UIs through LLMs, our dataset enhances generalization beyond web domains, significantly improving performance in document understanding, GUI comprehension, grounding, and advanced agent tasks. This demonstrates the potential of structured web data to elevate MLLMs' proficiency in processing text-rich visual environments and generalizing across domains",

    "title": "Fast unsupervised ground metric learning with tree-Wasserstein distance",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The performance of unsupervised methods such as clustering depends on the choice of distance metric between features, or ground metric. Commonly, ground metrics are decided with heuristics or learned via supervised algorithms. However, since many interesting datasets are unlabelled, unsupervised ground metric learning approaches have been introduced. One promising option employs Wasserstein singular vectors (WSVs), which emerge when computing optimal transport distances between features and samples simultaneously. WSVs are effective, but can be prohibitively computationally expensive in some applications: $\\mathcal{O}(n^2m^2(n \\log(n) + m \\log(m))$ for $n$ samples and $m$ features. In this work, we propose to augment the WSV method by embedding samples and features on trees, on which we compute the tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the algorithm converges to a better approximation of the standard WSV approach than the best known alternatives, and does so with $\\mathcal{O}(n^3+m^3+mn)$ complexity. In addition, we prove that the initial tree structure can be chosen flexibly, since tree geometry does not constrain the richness of the approximation up to the number of edge weights. This proof suggests a fast and recursive algorithm for computing the tree parameter basis set, which we find crucial to realising the efficiency gains at scale. Finally, we employ the tree-WSV algorithm to several single-cell RNA sequencing genomics datasets, demonstrating its scalability and utility for unsupervised cell-type clustering problems. These results poise unsupervised ground metric learning with TWD as a low-rank approximation of WSV with the potential for widespread application",

    "abstract": "State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as an appealing alternative to Transformers for large language models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with constant memory complexity which allows for holding longer context lengths than attention-based networks. The superior computational efficiency of SSMs in long sequence modeling positions them favorably over Transformers in many scenarios. However, improving the efficiency of SSMs on request-intensive cloud-serving and resource-limited edge applications is still a formidable task. SSM quantization is a possible solution to this problem, making SSMs more suitable for wide deployment, while still maintaining their accuracy. Quantization is a common technique to reduce the model size and to utilize the low bit-width acceleration features on modern computing units, yet existing quantization techniques are poorly suited for SSMs. Most notably, SSMs have highly sensitive feature maps within the selective scan mechanism (i.e., linear recurrence) and massive outliers in the output activations which are not present in the output of token-mixing in the self-attention modules. To address this issue, we propose a static 8-bit per-tensor SSM quantization method which suppresses the maximum values of the input activations to the selective SSM for finer quantization precision and quantizes the output activations in an outlier-free space with Hadamard transform. Our 8-bit weight-activation quantized Mamba 2.8B SSM benefits from hardware acceleration and achieves a 1.72 $\\times$ lower generation latency on an Nvidia Orin Nano 8G, with only a 0.9\\% drop in average accuracy on zero-shot tasks. When quantizing Jamba, a 52B parameter SSM-style language model, we observe only a $1\\%$ drop in accuracy, demonstrating that our SSM quantization method is both effective and scalable for large language models, which require appropriate compression techniques for deployment.

We design and train flexibility predictors utilizing either only sequential or both sequential and structural information on the input.

Prevailing approaches are restricted to encoding videos to a fixed number of tokens, where too few tokens will result in overly lossy encodings, and too many tokens will result in prohibitively long sequence lengths. In this work, we introduce ElasticTok, a method that conditions on prior frames to adaptively encode a frame into a variable number of tokens. To enable this in a computationally scalable way, we propose a masking technique that drops a random number of tokens at the end of each frames's token encoding. During inference, ElasticTok can dynamically allocate tokens when needed -- more complex data can leverage more tokens, while simpler data only needs a few tokens. Our empirical evaluations on images and video demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficient token usage, paving the way for future development of more powerful multimodal models, world models, and agents.

We refer to this type of problem as a *multi-task*, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines",

    "abstract": "In Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVS), we observe a consistent drop in model performance as the query vocabulary set expands, especially when it includes semantically similar and ambiguous vocabularies, such as ‘sofa' and ‘couch'. The previous OVS evaluation protocol, however, does not account for such ambiguity, as any mismatch between model-predicted and human-annotated pairs is simply treated as incorrect on a pixel-wise basis. This contradicts the open nature of OVS, where ambiguous categories may both be correct from an open- world perspective. To address this, in this work, we study the open nature of OVS and propose a mask-wise evaluation protocol that is based on matched and mis- matched mask pairs between prediction and annotation respectively. Extensive experimental evaluations show that the proposed mask-wise protocol provides a more effective and reliable evaluation framework for OVS models compared to the previous pixel-wise approach on the perspective of open-world. Moreover, analy- sis of mismatched mask pairs reveals that a large amount of ambiguous categories exist in commonly used OVS datasets. Interestingly, we find that reducing these ambiguities during both training and inference enhances capabilities of OVS mod- els. These findings and the new evaluation protocol encourage further exploration of the open nature of OVS, as well as broader open-world challenges.

    "abstract": "Bayesian observer and actor models have provided normative explanations for many behavioral phenomena in perception, sensorimotor control, and other areas of cognitive science and neuroscience. They attribute behavioral variability and biases to interpretable entities such as perceptual and motor uncertainty, prior beliefs, and behavioral costs. However, when extending these models to more naturalistic tasks with continuous actions, solving the Bayesian decision-making problem is often analytically intractable. Inverse decision-making, i.e. performing inference over the parameters of such models given behavioral data, is computationally even more difficult. Therefore, researchers typically constrain their models to easily tractable components, such as Gaussian distributions or quadratic cost functions, or resort to numerical approximations. To overcome these limitations, we amortize the Bayesian actor using a neural network trained on a wide range of parameter settings in an unsupervised fashion. Using the pre-trained neural network enables performing efficient gradient-based Bayesian inference of the Bayesian actor model's parameters. We show on synthetic data that the inferred posterior distributions are in close alignment with those obtained using analytical solutions where they exist. Where no analytical solution is available, we recover posterior distributions close to the ground truth. We then show how our method allows for principled model comparison and how it can be used to disentangle factors that may lead to unidentifiabilities between priors and costs. Finally, we apply our method to empirical data from three sensorimotor tasks and compare model fits with different cost functions to show that it can explain individuals' behavioral patterns",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in structure-based drug design (SBDD) have produced surprising results, with models often generating molecules that achieve better Vina docking scores than actual ligands. However, these results are frequently overly optimistic due to the limitations of docking score accuracy and the challenges of wet-lab validation. While generated molecules may demonstrate high QED (drug-likeness) and SA (synthetic accessibility) scores, they often lack true drug-like properties or synthesizability. To address these limitations, we propose a model-level evaluation framework that emphasizes practical metrics aligned with real-world applications. Inspired by recent findings on the utility of generated molecules in ligand-based virtual screening, our framework evaluates SBDD models by their ability to produce molecules that effectively retrieve active compounds from chemical libraries via similarity-based searches. This approach provides a direct indication of therapeutic potential, bridging the gap between theoretical performance and real-world utility. Our experiments reveal that while SBDD models may excel in theoretical metrics like Vina scores, they often fall short in these practical metrics. By introducing this new evaluation strategy, we aim to enhance the relevance and impact of SBDD models for pharmaceutical research and development",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools allowing for different kinds of prediction and inference on these systems, but getting a handle on uncertainty, especially in dynamic settings, is a challenging problem. In this work we propose to use a dynamic graph representation known in the tensor literature as the unfolding, to achieve valid prediction sets via conformal prediction. This representation, a simple graph, can be input to any standard GNN and does not require any modification to existing GNN architectures or conformal prediction routines. One of our key contributions is a careful mathematical consideration of the different inference scenarios which can arise in a dynamic graph modelling context. For a range of practically relevant cases, we obtain valid prediction sets with almost no assumptions, even dispensing with exchangeability. In a more challenging scenario, which we call the semi-inductive regime, we achieve valid prediction under stronger assumptions, akin to stationarity. We provide real data examples demonstrating validity, showing improved accuracy over baselines, and sign-posting different failure modes which can occur when those assumptions are violated",

To address these issues, we introduce Context-based Graph Neural Networks (ContextGNNs), a novel deep learning architecture for link prediction in recommendation systems. The method employs a pair-wise representation technique for familiar items situated within a user's local subgraph, while leveraging two-tower representations to facilitate the recommendation of exploratory items. A final network then predicts how to fuse both pair-wise and two-tower recommendations into a single ranking of items.

While most existing defenses attempt to mitigate the effects of adversarial prompts, they often prove inadequate as adversarial prompts can take arbitrary, adaptive forms. This paper introduces RobustKV, a novel jailbreak defense that takes a fundamentally different approach by selectively removing critical tokens of harmful queries from key-value (KV) caches. Intuitively, for an adversarial prompt to be effective, its tokens must achieve sufficient `importance' (measured by attention scores), which consequently lowers the importance of tokens in the concealed harmful query. Therefore, by carefully evicting the KVs of low-ranked tokens, RobustKV minimizes the harmful query's presence in the KV cache, thus preventing the LLM from generating informative responses. Extensive evaluation using benchmark datasets and models demonstrates that RobustKV effectively counters state-of-the-art jailbreak attacks while maintaining the LLM's performance on benign queries. Notably, RobustKV creates an interesting effectiveness-evasiveness dilemma for the adversary, leading to its robustness against adaptive attacks.{(Warning: This paper contains potentially harmful content generated by LLMs.)}",

Our main contribution is to prove the exact computational complexities showing that languages allowing addition and marginalization (via the summation operator) yield NP^{PP}-, PSPACE-, and NEXP-complete satisfiability problems, depending on the level of the PCH.

This raises two main challenges: First, unlike iterative gradient-based adjustment in scene-specific optimization, generalizable methods must reconstruct the human shape representation in a single pass at inference time. Second, rendering is preferably computationally efficient yet of high resolution. To address both challenges we augment the recently proposed dual shape representation, which combines the benefits of a mesh and Gaussian points, in two ways. To improve reconstruction, we propose an iterative feedback update framework, which successively improves the canonical human shape representation during reconstruction. To achieve computationally efficient yet high-resolution rendering, we study a coupled-multi-resolution Gaussians-on-Mesh representation. We evaluate the proposed approach on the challenging THuman2.0, XHuman and AIST++ data. Our approach reconstructs an animatable representation from sparse inputs in less than 1s, renders views with 95.1FPS at $1024 \\times 1024$, and achieves PSNR/LPIPS*/FID of 24.65/110.82/51.27 on THuman2.0, outperforming the state-of-the-art in rendering quality",

    "abstract": "We introduce NNsight and NDIF, technologies that work in tandem to enable scientific study of the representations and computations learned by very large neural networks. NNsight is an open-source system that extends PyTorch to introduce deferred remote execution. The National Deep Inference Fabric (NDIF) is a scalable inference service that executes NNsight requests, allowing users to share GPU resources and pretrained models. These technologies are enabled by the Intervention Graph, an architecture developed to decouple experimental design from model runtime. Together, this framework provides transparent and efficient access to the internals of deep neural networks such as very large language models (LLMs) without imposing the cost or complexity of hosting customized models individually. We conduct a quantitative survey of the machine learning literature that reveals a growing gap in the study of the internals of large-scale AI. We demonstrate the design and use of our framework to address this gap by enabling a range of research methods on huge models. Finally, we conduct benchmarks to compare performance with previous approaches. Code, documentation, and tutorials are available at https://nnsight.net/",

    "abstract": "Current backdoor defense methods are evaluated against a single attack at a time. This is unrealistic, as powerful machine learning systems are trained on large datasets scraped from the internet, which may be attacked multiple times by one or more attackers. We demonstrate that multiple backdoors can be simultaneously installed in a single model through parallel data poisoning attacks without substantially degrading clean accuracy. Furthermore, we show that existing backdoor defense methods do not effectively defend against multiple simultaneous attacks. Finally, we leverage insights into the nature of backdoor attacks to develop a new defense, BaDLoss (**Ba**ckdoor **D**etection via **Loss** Dynamics), that is effective in the multi-attack setting. With minimal clean accuracy degradation, BaDLoss attains an average attack success rate in the multi-attack setting of 7.98% in CIFAR-10, 10.29% in GTSRB, and 19.17% in Imagenette, compared to the average of other defenses at 63.44%, 74.83%, and 41.74% respectively.

Our Synthetic Coordinate Embedding (SyCo) framework maps 2D molecular graphs to 3D Euclidean point clouds via synthetic coordinates and learns the inverse map using an E($n$)-Equivariant Graph Neural Network (EGNN). The induced point cloud-structured latent space is well-suited to apply existing 3D molecule generative models. This approach simplifies the graph generation problem into a point cloud generation problem followed by node and edge classification tasks, without relying on molecular fragments nor autoregressive decoding. Further, we propose a novel similarity-constrained optimization scheme for 3D diffusion models based on inpainting and guidance. As a concrete implementation of our framework, we develop EDM-SyCo based on the E(3) Equivariant Diffusion Model (EDM). EDM-SyCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in distribution learning of molecular graphs, outperforming the best non-autoregressive methods by more than 26\\% on ZINC250K and 16\\% on the GuacaMol dataset while improving conditional generation by up to 3.9 times",

First, we examine conditions under which Fisher-Rao flows are absolutely continuous in the Wasserstein geometry. Second, we address specific interpolations $f_t$ and the learning of the related density/velocity pairs $(\\rho_t,v_t)$. It was numerically observed that the linear interpolation, which requires only a parametrization of the velocity field $v_t$, suffers from a \"teleportation-of-mass\" issue. Using tools from the Wasserstein geometry, we give an analytical example, where we can precisely measure the explosion of the velocity field. Inspired by Máté and Fleuret, who parametrize both $f_t$ and $v_t$, we propose an interpolation which parametrizes only $f_t$ and fixes an appropriate $v_t$. This corresponds to the Wasserstein gradient flow of the Kullback-Leibler divergence related to Langevin dynamics. We demonstrate by numerical examples that our model provides a well-behaved flow field which successfully solves the above sampling task",

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of embodied artificial intelligence, significant progress has been made in vision-language-action (VLA) models for general robot decision-making. However, the majority of existing VLAs fail to account for the inevitable external perturbations encountered during deployment. These perturbations introduce unforeseen state information to the VLA, resulting in inaccurate actions and consequently, a significant decline in generalization performance. The classic internal model control (IMC) principle demonstrates that a closed-loop system with an internal model that includes external input signals can accurately track the reference input and effectively offset the disturbance. We propose a novel closed-loop VLA method GEVRM that integrates the IMC principle to enhance the robustness of robot visual manipulation. The text-guided video generation model in GEVRM can generate highly expressive future visual planning goals. Simultaneously, we evaluate perturbations by simulating responses, which are called internal embeddings and optimized through prototype contrastive learning. This allows the model to implicitly infer and distinguish perturbations from the external environment. The proposed GEVRM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both standard and perturbed CALVIN benchmarks and shows significant improvements in realistic robot tasks",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models~(LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance across a wide range of tasks, but they still exhibit undesirable errors due to incorrect knowledge learned from the training data. To avoid this, knowledge editing methods emerged to precisely edit the specific model knowledge via efficiently modifying a very small percentage of parameters. However, those methods can lead to the problem of **Specificity Failure**, where the existing knowledge and capabilities are severely degraded due to editing. Our preliminary indicates that Specificity Failure primarily stems from the model's attention heads assigning excessive attention scores to entities related to the edited knowledge, thereby unduly focusing on specific snippets within the context, which we denote as the **Attention Drift** phenomenon. To mitigate such Attention Drift issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method **S**elective **A**ttention **D**rift **R**estriction(**SADR**), which introduces an additional regularization term during the knowledge editing process to restrict changes in the attention weight distribution, thereby preventing undue focus on the edited entity.

    "abstract": "Traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems can develop cooperative strategies through repeated interactions. However, these systems are unable to perform well on any other setting than the one they have been trained on, and struggle to successfully cooperate with unfamiliar collaborators. This is particularly visible in the Hanabi benchmark, a popular 2-to-5 player cooperative card-game which requires complex reasoning and precise assistance to other agents. Current MARL agents for Hanabi can only learn one specific game-setting (e.g., 2-player games), and play with the same algorithmic agents. This is in stark contrast to humans, who can quickly adjust their strategies to work with unfamiliar partners or situations. In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Replay Relevance Distributed DQN (R3D2), a generalist agent for Hanabi, designed to overcome these limitations. We reformulate the task using text, as language has been shown to improve transfer. We then propose a distributed MARL algorithm that copes with the resulting dynamic observation- and action-space. In doing so, our agent is the first that can play all game settings concurrently, and extend strategies learned from one setting to other ones. As a consequence, our agent also demonstrates the ability to collaborate with different algorithmic agents ---agents that are themselves unable to do so",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "The powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their growing use in evaluating human-generated content, particularly in evaluating research ideas within academic settings. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompt-based LLM methods or fine-tuned lightweight language models for idea evaluation. However, these methods are often unstable and struggle to comprehend the complex semantic information embedded in the ideas, impeding their ability to perform high-quality evaluations. To address the above challenges, we propose $\\texttt{GraphEval}$, a lightweight graph-based LLM framework for idea evaluation. Our insight is that a complex idea can be broken down into comprehensible viewpoint nodes using prompts from small LLMs. These viewpoint nodes can then be linked together through edges created from LLM-based relation extraction and/or BERT similarity scores. The created viewpoint-graph can be used to conveniently propagate scores across view-nodes to improve the robustness of the idea evaluations. In particular, we propose two lightweight graph-based methods for idea evaluation: (1) GraphEval-LP: a training-free label propagation algorithm that propagates evaluation scores from known view-nodes to unknown nodes; (2) GraphEval-GNN: a Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that is trained to predict the evaluation scores given the observed graph with minimal computation resources. Moreover, to overcome LLM's limitation in objectively assessing the novelty of ideas, we further propose a novelty detection model to GraphEval-GNN to enhance its capability in judging idea novelty. Experiments on two datasets show $\\texttt{GraphEval}$ improves F1 scores by at least 14% with low computation and API costs. Additionally, $\\texttt{GraphEval}$ can effectively detect plagiarized ideas",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) must often respond to highly ambiguous user requests. In such cases, the LLM's best response may be to ask a clarifying question to elicit more information. Existing LLMs often respond by presupposing a single interpretation of such ambiguous requests, frustrating users who intended a different interpretation. We speculate this is caused by current preference data labeling practice, where LLM responses are evaluated only on their prior contexts. To address this, we assign preference labels by simulating their expected outcomes in future turns. This allows LLMs to learn to ask clarifying questions when it can generate responses that are tailored to each user interpretation in future turns. On open-domain QA datasets with multiple annotations, we evaluate systems based on their ability to ask clarifying questions to recover each user's interpretation and expected answer. We compare systems trained using our proposed preference labeling methods against standard methods, which assign preferences based on only prior context. Our method achieves a 5% improvement in F1 measured against the answer set from different interpretations of each query, showing the value of modeling future conversation turns. We further demonstrate that our method can be used to train models to judiciously determine when to ask clarifying questions, directly answering the question when clarification is unnecessary. In our experiments, we find that our method achives a 3% improvement in accuracy of such judgments over existing methods",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and memorization capabilities via pretraining on massive textual corpora. However, this poses risk of privacy and copyright violations, highlighting the need for efficient machine unlearning methods that remove sensitive data without retraining from scratch. While Gradient Ascent (GA) is commonly used to unlearn by reducing the likelihood of generating unwanted content, it leads to unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting of retrained knowledge. We find that combining GA with low-rank adaptation results in poor trade-offs between computational cost and generative performance. To address these challenges, we propose Low-rank Knowledge Unlearning (LoKU), a novel framework that enables robust and efficient unlearning for LLMs. First, we introduce Inverted Hinge Loss, which suppresses unwanted tokens while maintaining fluency by boosting the probability of the next most likely token. Second, we develop a data-adaptive initialization for LoRA adapters via low-rank approximation weighted with relative Fisher information, thereby focusing updates on parameters critical for removing targeted knowledge. Experiments on the Training Data Extraction Challenge dataset using GPT-Neo models as well as on the TOFU benchmark with Phi-1.5B and Llama2-7B models demonstrate that our approach effectively removes sensitive information while maintaining reasoning and generative capabilities with minimal impact.

Using a parity-learning setup, we demonstrate that CoT can substantially improve sample efficiency even when the representation power is sufficient. Specifically, with CoT, a transformer can learn the function within polynomial samples, whereas without CoT, the required sample size is exponential. Additionally, we show that CoT simplifies the learning process by introducing sparse sequential dependencies among input tokens, and leads to a sparse and interpretable attention. We validate our theoretical analysis with both synthetic and real-world experiments, confirming that sparsity in attention layers is a key factor of the improvement induced by CoT",

To bridge this gap, we introduce CS-Bench, the first multilingual (English, Chinese, French, German) benchmark dedicated to evaluating the performance of LLMs in computer science. CS-Bench comprises approximately 10K meticulously curated test samples, covering 26 subfields across 4 key areas of computer science, encompassing various task forms and divisions of knowledge and reasoning. Utilizing CS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of over 30 mainstream LLMs, revealing the relationship between CS performance and model scales. We also quantitatively analyze the reasons for failures in existing LLMs and highlight directions for improvements, including knowledge supplementation and CS-specific reasoning. Further cross-capability experiments show a high correlation between LLMs' capabilities in computer science and their abilities in mathematics and coding. Moreover, expert LLMs specialized in mathematics and coding also demonstrate strong performances in several CS subfields.

For example, to control the thrust of a quad-copter propeller the controller modulates its rotation rate, relying on a straightforward mapping between the input rotation rate and the resulting thrust. This mapping can be inverted to determine the rotation rate needed to generate a desired thrust. However, in complex systems, such as flapping-wing robots where intricate fluid motions are involved, mapping inputs (wing kinematics) to outcomes (aerodynamic forces) is nontrivial and inverting this mapping for real-time control is computationally impractical. Here, we report a machine-learning solution for the inverse mapping of a flapping-wing system based on data from an experimental system we have developed. Our model learns the input wing motion required to generate a desired aerodynamic force outcome. We used a sequence-to-sequence model tailored for time-series data and augmented it with a novel adaptive-spectrum layer that implements representation learning in the frequency domain. To train our model, we developed a flapping wing system that simultaneously measures the wing's aerodynamic force and its 3D motion using high-speed cameras. We demonstrate the performance of our system on an additional open-source dataset of a flapping wing in a different flow regime. Results show superior performance compared with more complex state-of-the-art transformer-based models, with 11\\% improvement on the test datasets median loss. Moreover, our model shows superior inference time, making it practical for onboard robotic control.

However, current models struggle to capture semantic variations from word order changes, and existing evaluations, relying on indirect metrics like text-image similarity, fail to reliably assess these challenges. This often obscures poor performance on complex or uncommon linguistic patterns by the focus on frequent word combinations. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel metric called SemVarEffect and a benchmark named SemVarBench, designed to evaluate the causality between semantic variations in inputs and outputs in T2I synthesis. Semantic variations are achieved through two types of linguistic permutations, while avoiding easily predictable literal variations. Experiments reveal that the CogView-3-Plus and Ideogram 2 performed the best, achieving a score of 0.2/1. Semantic variations in object relations are less understood than attributes, scoring 0.07/1 compared to 0.17-0.19/1. We found that cross-modal alignment in UNet or Transformers plays a crucial role in handling semantic variations, a factor previously overlooked by a focus on textual encoders.

    "abstract": "The rapidly growing number and variety of Large Language Models (LLMs) present significant challenges in efficiently selecting the appropriate LLM for a given query, especially considering the trade-offs between performance and computational cost. Current LLM selection methods often struggle to generalize across new LLMs and different tasks because of their limited ability to leverage contextual interactions among tasks, queries, and LLMs, as well as their depen- dence on a transductive learning framework. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel inductive graph framework, named as GraphRouter, which fully utilizes the contextual information among tasks, queries, and LLMs to en- hance the LLM selection process. GraphRouter constructs a heterogeneous graph comprising task, query, and LLM nodes, with interactions represented as edges, which efficiently captures the contextual information between the query's requirements and the LLM's capabilities. Through an innovative edge prediction mechanism, GraphRouter is able to predict attributes (the effect and cost of LLM response) of potential edges, allowing for optimized recommendations that adapt to both existing and newly introduced LLMs without requiring retraining. Comprehensive experiments across three distinct effect-cost weight scenarios have shown that GraphRouter substantially surpasses existing routers, delivering a minimum performance improvement of 12.3%. In addition, it achieves enhanced generalization across new LLMs settings and supports diverse tasks with at least a 9.5% boost in effect and a significant reduction in computational demands.

    "title": "CONDA: Adaptive Concept Bottleneck for Foundation Models Under Distribution Shifts",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Advancements in foundation models (FMs) have led to a paradigm shift in machine learning. The rich, expressive feature representations from these pre-trained, large- scale FMs are leveraged for multiple downstream tasks, usually via lightweight fine-tuning of a shallow fully-connected network following the representation. However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature of this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains, such as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the potential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex, non-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making pipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the test-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline \"in the wild\", where the distribution of inputs often shifts from the original training distribution. We first identify the potential failure modes of such pipelines under different types of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck framework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the concept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data from the target domain, without access to the source dataset. Empirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show our framework produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with the test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning CBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "This work studies offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a class of non-Markovian environments called Regular Decision Processes (RDPs). In RDPs, the unknown dependency of future observations and rewards from the past interactions can be captured by some hidden finite-state automaton. For this reason, many RDP algorithms first reconstruct this unknown dependency using automata learning techniques. In this paper, we consider episodic RDPs and show that it is possible to overcome the limitations of existing offline RL algorithms for RDPs via the introduction of two original techniques: a novel metric grounded in formal language theory and an approach based on Count-Min-Sketch (CMS). Owing to the novel language metric, our algorithm is proven to be more sample efficient than existing results, and in some problem instances admitting low complexity languages, the gain is showcased to be exponential in the episode length. The CMS-based approach removes the need for naïve counting and alleviates the memory requirements for long planning horizons. We derive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity bounds associated to each of these techniques, and validate the approach experimentally",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming or approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we introduce *Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising* (DDPD), a novel framework that separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a denoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise next by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising, including both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement. This plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during generation by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal order. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods, achieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as *text8*, *OpenWebText*, and token-based generation on *ImageNet 256 × 256*. Notably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap between diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative perplexity.

    "abstract": "Recent results in non-convex stochastic optimization demonstrate the convergence of popular adaptive algorithms (e.g., AdaGrad) under the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, but the rate of convergence is a higher-order polynomial in terms of problem parameters like the smoothness constants. The complexity guaranteed by such algorithms to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point may be significantly larger than the optimal complexity of $\\Theta \\left( \\Delta L \\sigma^2 \\epsilon^{-4} \\right)$ achieved by SGD in the $L$-smooth setting, where $\\Delta$ is the initial optimality gap, $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of stochastic gradient. However, it is currently not known whether these higher-order dependencies can be tightened. To answer this question, we investigate complexity lower bounds for several adaptive optimization algorithms in the $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth setting, with a focus on the dependence in terms of problem parameters $\\Delta, L_0, L_1$. We provide complexity bounds for three variations of AdaGrad, which show at least a quadratic dependence on problem parameters $\\Delta, L_0, L_1$. Notably, we show that the decorrelated variant of AdaGrad-Norm requires at least $\\Omega \\left( \\Delta^2 L_1^2 \\sigma^2 \\epsilon^{-4} \\right)$ stochastic gradient queries to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point. We also provide a lower bound for SGD with a broad class of adaptive stepsizes.

To address this issue, we propose Geometric Reasoning Networks (GRN), a graph neural network (GNN)-based model for action and grasp feasibility prediction, designed to significantly reduce the dependency on the geometric planner. Moreover, we introduce two key interpretability mechanisms: inverse kinematics (IK) feasibility prediction and grasp obstruction (GO) estimation. These modules not only improve feasibility predictions accuracy, but also explain why certain actions or grasps are infeasible, thus allowing a more efficient search for a feasible solution.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values and away from undesirable behaviors (such as hallucination) has become increasingly important. Recently, steering LLMs towards a desired behavior via activation editing has emerged as an effective method to mitigate harmful generations at inference-time. Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving information from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising information from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations). When these demonstrations come from a private dataset, the aligned LLM may leak private information contained in those private samples. In this work, we present the first study of aligning LLM behavior with private datasets. Our work proposes the \\textit{\\underline{P}rivate \\underline{S}teering for LLM \\underline{A}lignment (PSA)} algorithm to edit LLM activations with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. We conduct extensive experiments on seven different benchmarks with open-source LLMs of different sizes (0.5B to 7B) and model families (LlaMa and Qwen). Our results show that PSA achieves DP guarantees for LLM alignment with minimal loss in performance, including alignment metrics, open-ended text generation quality, and general-purpose reasoning. We also develop the first Membership Inference Attack (MIA) for evaluating and auditing the empirical privacy for the problem of LLM steering via activation editing. Our attack is tailored for activation editing and relies solely on the generated texts without their associated probabilities. Our experiments support the theoretical guarantees by showing improved guarantees for our \\textit{PSA} algorithm compared to several existing non-private techniques",

However, it is not clear what performance tradeoffs, if any, exist between MoEs and standard dense transformers.

We begin by analyzing the theoretical limitations of MoEs at reasoning. We prove that there exist graph problems that cannot be solved by any number of experts of a certain width; however, the same task can be easily solved by a dense model with a slightly larger width. On the other hand, we find that on memory-intensive tasks, MoEs can effectively leverage a small number of active parameters with a large number of experts to memorize the data. We empirically validate these findings on synthetic graph problems and memory-intensive closed book retrieval tasks. Lastly, we pre-train a series of MoEs and dense transformers and evaluate them on commonly used benchmarks in math and natural language. We find that increasing the number of experts helps solve knowledge-intensive tasks, but fails to yield the same benefits for reasoning tasks",

Previous approaches have primarily focused on developing learning techniques, such as conservative methods tailored to MARL using limited offline data. However, these methods often overlook the temporal relationships across different timesteps and spatial relationships between teammates, resulting in low learning efficiency in imbalanced data scenarios. To comprehensively explore the data structure of MARL and enhance learning efficiency, we propose Multi-Agent offline coordination via Diffusion-based Trajectory Stitching (MADiTS), a novel diffusion-based data augmentation pipeline that systematically generates trajectories by stitching high-quality coordination segments together. MADiTS first generates trajectory segments using a trained diffusion model, followed by applying a bidirectional dynamics constraint to ensure that the trajectories align with environmental dynamics. Additionally, we develop an offline credit assignment technique to identify and optimize the behavior of underperforming agents in the generated segments. This iterative procedure continues until a satisfactory augmented episode trajectory is generated within the predefined limit or is discarded otherwise. Empirical results on imbalanced datasets of multiple benchmarks demonstrate that MADiTS significantly improves MARL performance",

    "title": "AdvWave: Stealthy Adversarial Jailbreak Attack against Large Audio-Language Models",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs) have enabled speech-based user interactions, significantly enhancing user experience and accelerating the deployment of LALMs in real-world applications. However, ensuring the safety of LALMs is crucial to prevent risky outputs that may raise societal concerns or violate AI regulations. Despite the importance of this issue, research on jailbreaking LALMs remains limited due to their recent emergence and the additional technical challenges they present compared to attacks on DNN-based audio models. Specifically, the audio encoders in LALMs, which involve discretization operations, often lead to gradient shattering, hindering the effectiveness of attacks relying on gradient-based optimizations. The behavioral variability of LALMs further complicates the identification of effective (adversarial) optimization targets. Moreover, enforcing stealthiness constraints on adversarial audio waveforms introduces a reduced, non-convex feasible solution space, further intensifying the challenges of the optimization process. To overcome these challenges, we develop AdvWave, the first jailbreak framework against LALMs. We propose a dual-phase optimization method that addresses gradient shattering, enabling effective end-to-end gradient-based optimization. Additionally, we develop an adaptive adversarial target search algorithm that dynamically adjusts the adversarial optimization target based on the response patterns of LALMs for specific queries. To ensure that adversarial audio remains perceptually natural to human listeners, we design a classifier-guided optimization approach that generates adversarial noise resembling common urban sounds. Extensive evaluations on multiple advanced LALMs demonstrate that AdvWave outperforms baseline methods, achieving a 40\\% higher average jailbreak attack success rate. Both audio stealthiness metrics and human evaluations confirm that adversarial audio generated by AdvWave is indistinguishable from natural sounds. We believe AdvWave will inspire future research aiming to enhance the safety alignment of LALMs, supporting their responsible deployment in real-world scenarios",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have shown promise in language modeling, yet their scalability and effectiveness in core language tasks, such as text generation and language understanding, remain underexplored. This paper establishes the first scaling law for MDMs, demonstrating a scaling rate comparable to autoregressive models (ARMs) and a relatively small compute gap. Motivated by their scalability, we train a family of MDMs with up to 1.1 billion (B) parameters to systematically evaluate their performance against ARMs of comparable or larger sizes. Fully leveraging the probabilistic formulation of MDMs, we propose a simple yet effective *unsupervised classifier-free guidance* that effectively exploits large-scale unpaired data, boosting performance for conditional inference. In language understanding, the 1.1B MDM outperforms the 1.1B TinyLlama model trained on the same data across four of eight zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, it achieves competitive math reasoning ability with the 7B Llama-2 model on the GSM8K dataset. In text generation, MDMs with 16 times more pre-training time offer a flexible trade-off against ARMs with the accelerated sampling technique KV-Cache: MDMs match ARMs in performance while being 1.4 times faster during sampling. Moreover, MDMs address challenging tasks for ARMs by effectively handling bidirectional reasoning and adapting to temporal shifts in data. Notably, a 1.1B MDM breaks the *reverse curse* encountered by much larger ARMs with significantly more data and computation, such as 13B Llama-2 and 175B GPT-3.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often produce errors, including factual inaccuracies, biases, and reasoning failures, collectively referred to as \"hallucinations\". Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs' internal states encode information regarding the truthfulness of their outputs, and that this information can be utilized to detect errors. In this work, we show that the internal representations of LLMs encode much more information about truthfulness than previously recognized. We first discover that the truthfulness information is concentrated in specific tokens, and leveraging this property significantly enhances error detection performance. Yet, we show that such error detectors fail to generalize across datasets, implying that---contrary to prior claims---truthfulness encoding is not universal but rather multifaceted. Next, we show that internal representations can also be used for predicting the types of errors the model is likely to make, facilitating the development of tailored mitigation strategies. Lastly, we reveal a discrepancy between LLMs' internal encoding and external behavior: they may encode the correct answer, yet consistently generate an incorrect one. Taken together, these insights deepen our understanding of LLM errors from the model's internal perspective, which can guide future research on enhancing error analysis and mitigation",

Inspired by Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (DANN), we propose a novel algorithm,SURE, for targeted unlearning.SURE treats the process as a domain adaptation problem, where the \"forget set\" (data to be removed) and a validation set from the same distribution form two distinct domains. We train a domain classifier to discriminate between representations from the forget and validation sets.Using a gradient reversal strategy similar to DANN, we perform gradient updates to the representations to \"fool\" the domain classifier and thus obfuscate representations belonging to the forget set. Simultaneously, gradient descent is applied to the retain set (original training data minus the forget set) to preserve its classification performance. Unlike other unlearning approaches whose training objectives are built based on model outputs, SURE directly manipulates the representations.This is key to ensure robustness against a set of more powerful attacks than currently considered in the literature, that aim to detect which examples were unlearned through access to learned embeddings. Our thorough experiments reveal that SURE has a better unlearning quality to utility trade-off compared to other standard unlearning techniques for deep neural networks",

These conclusions are typically based on the results of one or more Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions, raising the question: given a dataset, can we certify the robustness of an OLS fit on this dataset to the removal of a given number of samples? Brute-force techniques quickly break down even on small datasets. Existing approaches which go beyond brute force either can only find candidate small subsets to remove (but cannot certify their non-existence) [BGM20, KZC21], are computationally intractable beyond low dimensional settings [MR22], or require very strong assumptions on the data distribution and too many samples to give reasonable bounds in practice [BP21, FH23]. We present an efficient algorithm for certifying the robustness of linear regressions to removals of samples. We implement our algorithm and run it on several landmark econometrics datasets with hundreds of dimensions and tens of thousands of samples, giving the first non-trivial certificates of robustness to sample removal for datasets of dimension $4$ or greater.

Traditional methods for calculating these numbers suffer from factorial computational complexity, making them impractical to use. By reformulating the problem as a continuous optimization task, we compute intersection numbers across a wide value range from $10^{-45}$ to $10^{45}$. To capture the recursive nature inherent in these intersection numbers, we propose the Dynamic Range Activator (DRA), a new activation function that enhances the Transformer's ability to model recursive patterns and handle severe heteroscedasticity. Given precision requirements for computing the intersections, we quantify the uncertainty of the predictions using Conformal Prediction with a dynamic sliding window adaptive to the partitions of equivalent number of marked points. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior work on modeling recursive functions with such a high-variance and factorial growth. Beyond simply computing intersection numbers, we explore the enumerative \"world-model\" of Transformers. Our interpretability analysis reveals that the network is implicitly modeling the Virasoro constraints in a purely data-driven manner. Moreover, through abductive hypothesis testing, probing, and causal inference, we uncover evidence of an emergent internal representation of the the large-genus asymptotic of $\\psi$-class intersection numbers.

Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate --- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o \\& 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B \\& 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice --- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act",

    "title": "EqNIO: Subequivariant Neural Inertial Odometry",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neural network-based odometry using accelerometer and gyroscope readings from a single IMU can achieve robust, and low-drift localization capabilities, through the use of _neural displacement priors (NDPs)_. These priors learn to produce denoised displacement measurements but need to ignore data variations due to specific IMU mount orientation and motion directions, hindering generalization. This work introduces EqNIO, which addresses this challenge with _canonical displacement priors_, i.e., priors that are invariant to the orientation of the gravity-aligned frame in which the IMU data is expressed. We train such priors on IMU measurements, that are mapped into a learnable canonical frame, which is uniquely defined via three axes: the first is gravity, making the frame gravity aligned, while the second and third are predicted from IMU data. The outputs (displacement and covariance) are mapped back to the original gravity-aligned frame. To maximize generalization, we find that these learnable frames must transform equivariantly with global gravity-preserving roto-reflections from the subgroup $O_g(3)\\subset O(3)$, acting on the trajectory, rendering the NDP $O(3)$-_subequivariant_. We tailor specific linear, convolutional, and non-linear layers that commute with the actions of the group. Moreover, we introduce a bijective decomposition of angular rates into vectors that transform similarly to accelerations, allowing us to leverage both measurement types. Natively, angular rates would need to be inverted upon reflection, unlike acceleration, which hinders their joint processing. We highlight EqNIO's flexibility and generalization capabilities by applying it to both filter-based (TLIO), and end-to-end (RONIN) architectures, and outperforming existing methods that use _soft equivariance from auxiliary losses or data augmentation on various datasets. We believe this work paves the way for low-drift and generalizable neural inertial odometry on edge devices.

    "abstract": "The rising interest in leveraging higher-order interactions present in complex systems has led to a surge in more expressive models exploiting higher-order structures in the data, especially in topological deep learning (TDL), which designs neural networks on higher-order domains such as simplicial complexes. However, progress in this field is hindered by the scarcity of datasets for benchmarking these architectures. To address this gap, we introduce MANTRA, the first large-scale, diverse, and intrinsically higher-order dataset for benchmarking higher-order models, comprising over 43,000 and 250,000 triangulations of surfaces and three-dimensional manifolds, respectively. With MANTRA, we assess several graph- and simplicial complex-based models on three topological classification tasks. We demonstrate that while simplicial complex-based neural networks generally outperform their graph-based counterparts in capturing simple topological invariants, they also struggle, suggesting a rethink of TDL. Thus, MANTRA serves as a benchmark for assessing and advancing topological methods, paving the way towards more effective higher-order models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning models have demonstrated impressive abilities to capture semantic similarities by aligning representations in the embedding space. However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Preference Optimization (PO) methods such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to align generative models with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using different PO methods to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks and inductive biases, commonly seen in contrastive vision-language models like CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method for tackling typographic attacks on images and explore its ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), well-designed communication protocols can effectively facilitate consensus among agents, thereby enhancing task performance. Moreover, in large-scale multi-agent systems commonly found in real-world applications, effective communication plays an even more critical role due to the escalated challenge of partial observability compared to smaller-scale setups. In this work, we endeavor to develop a scalable communication protocol for MARL. Unlike previous methods that focus on selecting optimal pairwise communication links—a task that becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents grows—we adopt a global perspective on communication topology design. Specifically, we propose utilizing the exponential topology to enable rapid information dissemination among agents by leveraging its small-diameter and small-size properties. This approach leads to a scalable communication protocol, named ExpoComm. To fully unlock the potential of exponential graphs as communication topologies, we employ memory-based message processors and auxiliary tasks to ground messages, ensuring that they reflect global information and benefit decision-making. Extensive experiments on large-scale cooperative benchmarks, including MAgent and Infrastructure Management Planning, demonstrate the superior performance and robust zero-shot transferability of ExpoComm compared to existing communication strategies.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have profoundly influenced the field of computer vision, drawing significant inspiration from the visual processing mechanisms inherent in the brain. Despite sharing fundamental structural and representational similarities with the biological visual system, differences in local connectivity patterns within CNNs open up an interesting area to explore. In this work, we explore whether integrating biologically observed receptive fields (RFs) can enhance model performance and foster alignment with brain representations. We introduce a novel methodology, termed $L_p$-convolution, which employs the multivariate $L_p$-generalized normal distribution as an adaptable $L_p$-masks, to reconcile disparities between artificial and biological RFs. $L_p$-masks finds the optimal RFs through task-dependent adaptation of conformation such as distortion, scale, and rotation. This allows $L_p$-convolution to excel in tasks that require flexible RF shapes, including not only square-shaped regular RFs but also horizontal and vertical ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate that $L_p$-convolution with biological RFs significantly enhances the performance of large kernel CNNs possibly by introducing structured sparsity inspired by $L_p$-generalized normal distribution in convolution. Lastly, we present that neural representations of CNNs align more closely with the visual cortex when -convolution is close to biological RFs",

    "abstract": "Training language models becomes increasingly expensive with scale, prompting numerous attempts to improve optimization efficiency. Despite these efforts, the Adam optimizer remains the most widely used, due to a prevailing view that it is the most effective approach. We aim to compare several optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adafactor, Adam, Lion, and Sophia in the context of autoregressive language modeling across a range of model sizes, hyperparameters, and architecture variants. Our findings indicate that, except for SGD, these algorithms all perform comparably both in their optimal performance and also in terms of how they fare across a wide range of hyperparameter choices. Our results suggest to practitioners that the choice of optimizer can be guided by practical considerations like memory constraints and ease of implementation, as no single algorithm emerged as a clear winner in terms of performance or stability to hyperparameter misspecification. Given our findings, we further dissect these approaches, examining two simplified versions of Adam: a) signed momentum (Signum) which we see recovers both the performance and hyperparameter stability of Adam and b) Adalayer, a layerwise variant of Adam which we introduce to study the impact on Adam's preconditioning for different layers of the network. Examining Adalayer leads us to the conclusion that, perhaps surprisingly, adaptivity on *both* the last layer and LayerNorm parameters in particular are necessary for retaining performance and stability to learning rate",

    "title": "Interaction Asymmetry: A General Principle for Learning Composable Abstractions",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Learning disentangled representations of concepts and re-composing them in unseen ways is crucial for generalizing to out-of-domain situations. However, the underlying properties of concepts that enable such disentanglement and compositional generalization remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose the principle of interaction asymmetry which states: \"Parts of the same concept have more complex interactions than parts of different concepts\". We formalize this via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the generator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of \"complexity\" correspond to different $n$. Using this formalism, we prove that interaction asymmetry enables both disentanglement and compositional generalization. Our results unify recent theoretical results for learning concepts of objects, which we show are recovered as special cases with $n=0$ or $1$. We provide results for up to $n=2$, thus extending these prior works to more flexible generator functions, and conjecture that the same proof strategies generalize to larger $n$. Practically, our theory suggests that, to disentangle concepts, an autoencoder should penalize its latent capacity and the interactions between concepts during decoding. We propose an implementation of these criteria using a flexible Transformer-based VAE, with a novel regularizer on the attention weights of the decoder. On synthetic image datasets consisting of objects, we provide evidence that this model can achieve comparable object disentanglement to existing models that use more explicit object-centric priors",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT) methods have recently gained significant popularity thanks to the widespread availability of large-scale pretrained models. These methods allow for quick adaptation to downstream tasks with minimal computational cost. However, popular finetuning methods such as LoRA exhibit limited robustness when it comes to hyperparameter choices or extended training regimes, preventing optimal out-of-the-box performance. In contrast, bounded approaches, such as ETHER, provide greater robustness but are limited to extremely low-rank adaptations and fixed-strength transformations, reducing their adaptation expressive power. In this work, we propose Decoupled Low-rank Adaptation (DeLoRA), a novel finetuning method that normalizes and scales learnable low-rank matrices. By bounding the distance of the transformation, DeLoRA effectively decouples the angular learning from the adaptation strength, enhancing robustness without compromising performance. Through evaluations on subject-driven image generation, natural language understanding, and instruction tuning, we show that DeLoRA matches or surpasses performance of competing PEFT methods, while exhibiting stronger robustness.

However, the focus of GML has predominantly been on developing powerful models, often overlooking a crucial initial step: constructing suitable graphs from common data formats, such as tabular data. This construction process is fundamental to applying graph-based models, yet it remains largely understudied and lacks formalization. Our research aims to address this gap by formalizing the graph construction problem and proposing an effective solution. We identify two critical challenges to achieve this goal: 1. The absence of dedicated datasets to formalize and evaluate the effectiveness of graph construction methods, and 2. Existing automatic construction methods can only be applied to some specific cases, while tedious human engineering is required to generate high-quality graphs. To tackle these challenges, we present a two-fold contribution. First, we introduce a set of datasets to formalize and evaluate graph construction methods. Second, we propose an LLM-based solution, AutoG, automatically generating high-quality graph schemas without human intervention. The experimental results demonstrate that the quality of constructed graphs is critical to downstream task performance, and AutoG can generate high-quality graphs that rival those produced by human experts.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Neural networks that map between low dimensional spaces are ubiquitous in computer graphics and scientific computing; however, in their naive implementation, they are unable to learn high frequency information. We present a comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for mitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid parametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional mappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher resolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it susceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid structure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in performance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings through the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's performance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable embedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely solely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically validated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym sets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the Stanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and multiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details are learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders of magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE. The increase in spectrum corresponds to a 15 dB (PSNR) / 0.65 (MS-SSIM) increase over baseline and a 12 dB (PSNR) / 0.33 (MS-SSIM) increase over the FFE",

However, in safety-critical applications, the risks associated with such exploration can lead to catastrophic consequences.

Heavy penalties for early constraint violations can trap agents in local optima, deterring exploration of risky yet high-reward regions of the state space. To address this, we introduce a method that explicitly learns state-conditioned safety representations. By augmenting the state features with these safety representations, our approach naturally encourages safer exploration without being excessively cautious, resulting in more efficient and safer policy learning in safety-critical scenarios.

In cognitive science and psychology, this is termed relational reasoning and a number of effects and biases have been observed in human cognition.

    "abstract": "The goal of the AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms competition is to evaluate practical speed-ups in neural network training achieved solely by improving the underlying training algorithms. In the external tuning ruleset, submissions must provide workload-agnostic hyperparameter search spaces, while in the self-tuning ruleset they must be completely hyperparameter-free. In both rulesets, submissions are compared on time-to-result across multiple deep learning workloads, training on fixed hardware. This paper presents the inaugural AlgoPerf competition's results, which drew 18 diverse submissions from 10 teams. Our investigation reveals several key findings: (1) The winning submission in the external tuning ruleset, using Distributed Shampoo, demonstrates the effectiveness of non-diagonal preconditioning over popular methods like Adam, even when compared on wall-clock runtime. (2) The winning submission in the self-tuning ruleset, based on the Schedule Free AdamW algorithm, demonstrates a new level of effectiveness for completely hyperparameter-free training algorithms. (3) The top-scoring submissions were surprisingly robust to workload changes. We also discuss the engineering challenges encountered in ensuring a fair comparison between different training algorithms. These results highlight both the significant progress so far, and the considerable room for further improvements",

    "title": "Injecting Universal Jailbreak Backdoors into LLMs in Minutes",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Jailbreak backdoor attacks on LLMs have garnered attention for their effectiveness and stealth. However, existing methods rely on the crafting of poisoned datasets and the time-consuming process of fine-tuning. In this work, we propose JailbreakEdit, a novel jailbreak backdoor injection method that exploits model editing techniques to inject a universal jailbreak backdoor into safety-aligned LLMs with minimal intervention *in minutes*. JailbreakEdit integrates a multi-node target estimation to estimate the jailbreak space, thus creating shortcuts from the backdoor to this estimated jailbreak space that induce jailbreak actions. Our attack effectively shifts the models' attention by attaching strong semantics to the backdoor, enabling it to bypass internal safety mechanisms. Experimental results show that JailbreakEdit achieves a high jailbreak success rate on jailbreak prompts while preserving generation quality, and safe performance on normal queries. Our findings underscore the effectiveness, stealthiness, and explainability of JailbreakEdit, emphasizing the need for more advanced defense mechanisms in LLMs",

    "title": "Action abstractions for amortized sampling",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As trajectories sampled by policies used by reinforcement learning (RL) and generative flow networks (GFlowNets) grow longer, credit assignment and exploration become more challenging, and the long planning horizon hinders mode discovery and generalization. The challenge is particularly pronounced in entropy-seeking RL methods, such as generative flow networks, where the agent must learn to sample from a structured distribution and discover multiple high-reward states, each of which take many steps to reach. To tackle this challenge, we propose an approach to incorporate the discovery of action abstractions, or high-level actions, into the policy optimization process. Our approach involves iteratively extracting action subsequences commonly used across many high-reward trajectories and `chunking' them into a single action that is added to the action space. In empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world environments, our approach demonstrates improved sample efficiency performance in discovering diverse high-reward objects, especially on harder exploration problems. We also observe that the abstracted high-order actions are potentially interpretable, capturing the latent structure of the reward landscape of the action space. This work provides a cognitively motivated approach to action abstraction in RL and is the first demonstration of hierarchical planning in amortized sequential sampling",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation improves various aspects of large language models (LLMs) generation, but suffers from computational overhead caused by long contexts, and the propagation of irrelevant retrieved information into generated responses. Context pruning deals with both aspects, by removing irrelevant parts of retrieved contexts before LLM generation. Existing context pruning approaches are limited, and do not present a universal model that would be both _efficient_ and _robust_ in a wide range of scenarios, e.g., when contexts contain a variable amount of relevant information or vary in length, or when evaluated on various domains. In this work, we close this gap and introduce Provence (Pruning and Reranking Of retrieVEd relevaNt ContExts), an efficient and robust context pruner for Question Answering, which dynamically detects the needed amount of pruning for a given context and can be used out-of-the-box for various domains. The three key ingredients of Provence are formulating the context pruning task as sequence labeling, unifying context pruning capabilities with context reranking, and training on diverse data. Our experimental results show that Provence enables context pruning with negligible to no drop in performance, in various domains and settings, at almost no cost in a standard RAG pipeline. We also conduct a deeper analysis alongside various ablations to provide insights into training context pruners for future work",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified one aggravating factor of LLM hallucinations as the knowledge inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning, where unfamiliar fine-tuning data mislead the LLM to fabricate plausible but wrong outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy called Prereq-Tune to address this knowledge inconsistency and reduce hallucinations. Fundamentally, Prereq-Tune disentangles the learning of skills and knowledge, so the model learns only the task skills without being impacted by the knowledge inconsistency. To achieve this, Prereq-Tune introduces an additional prerequisite learning stage to learn the necessary knowledge for SFT, allowing subsequent SFT to focus only on task skills. Prereq-Tune can also be combined with fictitious synthetic data to enhance the grounding of LLM outputs to their internal knowledge. Experiments show that Prereq-Tune outperforms existing baselines in improving LLM's factuality across short QA and long-form generation tasks. It also opens new possibilities for knowledge-controlled generation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Prereq_tune.git",

    "abstract": "Many works have developed no-regret algorithms for contextual bandits with function approximation, where the mean rewards over context-action pairs belong to a function class $\\mathcal{F}$. Although there are many approaches to this problem, algorithms based on the principle of optimism, such as optimistic least squares have gained in importance. It can be shown the regret of this algorithm scales as $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(\\sqrt{d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F}) \\log(\\mathcal{F}) T }\\right)$ where $d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F})$ is a statistical measure of the complexity of the function class $\\mathcal{F}$ known as eluder dimension. Unfortunately, even if the variance of the measurement noise of the rewards at time $t$ equals $\\sigma_t^2$ and these are close to zero, the optimistic least squares algorithm's regret scales with $\\sqrt{T}$. In this work we are the first to develop algorithms that satisfy regret bounds for contextual bandits with function approximation of the form $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\sigma \\sqrt{\\log(\\mathcal{F})d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F}) T } + d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F}) \\cdot \\log(|\\mathcal{F}|)\\right) $ when the variances are unknown and satisfy $\\sigma_t^2 = \\sigma$ for all $t$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F})\\sqrt{\\log(\\mathcal{F})\\sum_{t=1}^T \\sigma_t^2 } + d_{\\mathrm{eluder}}(\\mathcal{F}) \\cdot \\log(|\\mathcal{F}|)\\right) $ when the variances change every time-step.

    "abstract": "The reasoning abilities are one of the most enigmatic and captivating aspects of large language models (LLMs). Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways. Additionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This Reflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Large-scale deep learning models with a pretraining-finetuning paradigm have led to a surge of numerous task-specific models fine-tuned from a common pre-trained model. Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging these large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple arithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge: interference between model parameters fine-tuned on different tasks. Few recent works have focused on designing a new fine-tuning scheme that can lead to small parameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each task-specific fine-tuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model. To improve the performance of a merged model, we note that a fine-tuning scheme should aim for (1) smaller parameter interference and (2) better performance of each fine-tuned model on the corresponding task. In this work, we aim to design a new fine-tuning objective function to work towards these two goals. In the course of this process, we find such objective function to be strikingly similar to sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objective function, which aims to achieve generalization by finding flat minima. Drawing upon our observation, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained models via sharpness-aware minimization. The experimental and theoretical results showcase the effectiveness and orthogonality of our proposed approach, improving performance upon various merging and fine-tuning methods.

In this paper, we define workflows as an activity-on-vertex (AOV) graph, which allows continuous workflow refinement by LLM agents through dynamic subtask allocation adjustment based on historical performance and previous AOVs. To further enhance framework performance, we emphasize modularity in workflow design based on evaluating parallelism and dependency complexity. With this design, our proposed multi-agent framework achieves efficient concurrent execution of subtasks, effective goal achievement, and enhanced error tolerance.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multivariate time series data play a pivotal role in a wide range of real-world applications, such as finance, healthcare, and meteorology, where accurate forecasting is critical for informed decision-making and proactive interventions. However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed its rapid development in novel view synthesis, which attains high quality reconstruction and real-time rendering. At the same time, there is still a gap before implicit neural representation (INR) can become a practical compressor due to the lack of stream decoding and real-time frame reconstruction on consumer-grade hardware. It remains a question whether the fast rendering and partial parameter decoding characteristics of 3DGS are applicable to video compression. To address these challenges, we propose a Toast-like Sliding Window (TSW) orthographic projection for converting any 3D Gaussian model into a video representation model. This method efficiently represents video by leveraging temporal redundancy through a sliding window approach. Additionally, the converted model is inherently stream-decodable and offers a higher rendering frame rate compared to INR methods. Building on TSW, we introduce an end-to-end trainable video compression method, GSVC, which employs deformable Gaussian representation and optical flow guidance to capture dynamic content in videos. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively transforms a 3D Gaussian model into a practical video compressor. GSVC further achieves better rate-distortion performance than NeRV on the UVG dataset, while achieving higher frame reconstruction speed (+30%~40% fps) and stream decoding.

    "abstract": "Human perception integrates multiple modalities—such as vision, hearing, and language—into a unified understanding of the surrounding reality. While recent multimodal models have achieved significant progress by aligning pairs of modalities via contrastive learning, their solutions are unsuitable when scaling to multiple modalities. These models typically align each modality to a designated anchor without ensuring the alignment of all modalities with each other, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks requiring a joint understanding of multiple modalities. In this paper, we structurally rethink the pairwise conventional approach to multimodal learning and we present the novel Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM), which overcomes the above-mentioned limitations. GRAM learns and then aligns $n$ modalities directly in the higher-dimensional space in which modality embeddings lie by minimizing the Gramian volume of the $k$-dimensional parallelotope spanned by the modality vectors, ensuring the geometric alignment of all modalities simultaneously. GRAM can replace cosine similarity in any downstream method, holding for 2 to $n$ modalities and providing more meaningful alignment with respect to previous similarity measures. The novel GRAM-based contrastive loss function enhances the alignment of multimodal models in the higher-dimensional embedding space, leading to new state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as video-audio-text retrieval and audio-video classification",

This is difficult to study, as (i) much of the available evaluation data has already been seen by the most capable models during training, and (ii) existing benchmarks do not capture how problem proofs may be arbitrarily complex in various ways. In this paper, we present a data-generation framework for evaluating LLMs on problems with arbitrarily complex arithmetic proofs, called MathGAP. MathGAP generates problem statements and chain-of-thought reasoning traces according to specifications about their arithmetic proof structure, enabling systematic studies on easy-to-hard generalization with respect to complexity of proof trees. Using MathGAP, we find that LLMs show a significant decrease in performance as proofs get deeper and wider. This effect is more pronounced in complex, nonlinear proof structures, which are challenging even for the most capable models. The models are also sensitive to simple changes in sentence ordering.

In the online version of the problem, the learner faces a new seller and buyer at each time step, and has to post a price for each of the two parties without any knowledge of their valuations. We consider a scenario where, at each time step, before posting prices the learner observes a context vector containing information about the features of the item for sale. The valuations of both the seller and the buyer follow an unknown linear function of the context. In this setting, the learner could leverage previous transactions in an attempt to estimate private valuations. We characterize the regret regimes of different settings, taking as a baseline the best context-dependent prices in hindsight. First, in the setting in which the learner has two-bit feedback and strong budget balance constraints, we propose an algorithm with $O(\\log T)$ regret. Then, we study the same set-up with noisy valuations, providing a tight $\\widetilde O(T^{2/3})$ regret upper bound. Finally, we show that loosening budget balance constraints allows the learner to operate under more restrictive feedback. Specifically, we show how to address the one-bit, global budget balance setting through a reduction from the two-bit, strong budget balance setup. This established a fundamental trade-off between the quality of the feedback and the strictness of the budget constraints",

To this end, Causal Representation Learning (CRL) constitutes one of the most promising approaches, as it aims to identify the latent factors that causally govern biological systems, thus facilitating the prediction of the effect of unseen perturbations. Yet, current CRL methods fail in reconciling their principled latent representations with known biological processes, leading to models that are not interpretable. To address this major issue, in this work we present SENA-discrepancy-VAE, a model based on the recently proposed CRL method discrepancy-VAE, that produces representations where each latent factor can be interpreted as the (linear) combination of the activity of a (learned) set of biological processes. To this extent, we present an encoder, SENA-$\\delta$, that efficiently compute and map biological processes' activity levels to the latent causal factors. We show that SENA-discrepancy-VAE achieves predictive performances on unseen combinations of interventions that are comparable with its original, non-interpretable counterpart, while inferring causal latent factors that are biologically meaningful",

From this results, we derive how separability is influenced by hyperparameters and architectural choices—such as activation functions, depth, hidden layer width, and representation types. Notably, all non-polynomial activations, including ReLU and sigmoid, are equivalent in expressivity and reach maximum separation power. Depth improves separation power up to a threshold, after which further increases have no effect. Adding invariant features to hidden representations does not impact separation power. Finally, block decomposition of hidden representations affects separability, with minimal components forming a hierarchy in separation power that provides a straightforward method for comparing the separation power of models",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Advancing safe autonomous systems through reinforcement learning (RL) requires robust benchmarks to evaluate performance, analyze methods, and assess agent competencies. Humans primarily rely on embodied visual perception to safely navigate and interact with their surroundings, making it a valuable capability for RL agents. However, existing vision-based 3D benchmarks only consider simple navigation tasks. To address this shortcoming, we introduce **HASARD**, a suite of diverse and complex tasks to **HA**rness **SA**fe **R**L with **D**oom, requiring strategic decision-making, comprehending spatial relationships, and predicting the short-term future. HASARD features three difficulty levels and two action spaces. An empirical evaluation of popular baseline methods demonstrates the benchmark's complexity, unique challenges, and reward-cost trade-offs. Visualizing agent navigation during training with top-down heatmaps provides insight into a method's learning process. Incrementally training across difficulty levels offers an implicit learning curriculum. HASARD is the first safe RL benchmark to exclusively target egocentric vision-based learning, offering a cost-effective and insightful way to explore the potential and boundaries of current and future safe RL methods.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "In ``Large Associative Memory Problem in Neurobiology and Machine Learning,'' Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield introduced a general technique for the systematic construction of neural ordinary differential equations with non-increasing energy or Lyapunov function. We study this energy function and identify that it is vulnerable to the problem of dead neurons. Each point in the state space where the neuron dies is contained in a non-compact region with constant energy. In these flat regions, energy function alone does not completely determine all degrees of freedom and, as a consequence, can not be used to analyze stability or find steady states or basins of attraction. We perform a direct analysis of the dynamical system and show how to resolve problems caused by flat directions corresponding to dead neurons: (i) all information about the state vector at a fixed point can be extracted from the energy and Hessian matrix (of Lagrange function), (ii) it is enough to analyze stability in the range of Hessian matrix, (iii) if steady state touching flat region is stable the whole flat region is the basin of attraction. The analysis of the Hessian matrix can be complicated for realistic architectures, so we show that for a slightly altered dynamical system (with the same structure of steady states), one can derive a diverse family of Lyapunov functions that do not have flat regions corresponding to dead neurons. In addition, these energy functions allow one to use Lagrange functions with Hessian matrices that are not necessarily positive definite and even consider architectures with non-symmetric feedforward and feedback connections",

While metagenomic datasets feature enormous biological diversity, their utilization as pretraining data has been limited due to challenges in data accessibility, quality filtering and deduplication. Here, we present the Open MetaGenomic (OMG) corpus, a genomic pretraining dataset totalling 3.1T base pairs and 3.3B protein coding sequences, obtained by combining two largest metagenomic dataset repositories (JGI's IMG and EMBL's MGnify). We first document the composition of the dataset and describe the quality filtering steps taken to remove poor quality data.

Recently, self-supervised learning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without requiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for training neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these methods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key properties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and geodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the Eikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex and unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of optimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid spurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the Eikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in handling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with robot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF)",

    "abstract": "Latent space matching, which consists of matching distributions of features in latent space, is a crucial component for tasks such as adversarial attacks and defenses, domain adaptation, and generative modelling. Metrics for probability measures, such as Wasserstein and maximum mean discrepancy, are commonly used to quantify the differences between such distributions. However, these are often costly to compute, or do not appropriately take the geometric and topological features of the distributions into consideration. Persistent homology is a tool from topological data analysis which quantifies the multi-scale topological structure of point clouds, and has recently been used as a topological regularizer in learning tasks. However, computation costs preclude larger scale computations, and discontinuities in the gradient lead to unstable training behavior such as in adversarial tasks. We propose the use of principal persistence measures, based on computing the persistent homology of a large number of small subsamples, as a topological regularizer. We provide a parallelized GPU implementation of this regularizer, and prove that gradients are continuous for smooth densities. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this regularizer on shape matching, image generation, and semi-supervised learning tasks, opening the door towards a scalable regularizer for topological features",

Various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been devised to mitigate these challenges by training a small set of parameters for the task-specific updates of the model weights. Among PEFT methods, LoRA stands out for its simplicity and efficiency, inspiring the development of a series of variants. However, LoRA and its successors disregard the knowledge that is noisy or irrelevant to the targeted task, detrimentally impacting model performance and leading to suboptimality. To address this limitation, we introduce Knowledge-aware Singular-value Adaptation (KaSA), a PEFT method that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) with knowledge-aware singular values to dynamically activate knowledge based on its relevance to the task at hand. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of LLMs on tasks spanning natural language understanding (NLU), generation (NLG), instruction following, and commonsense reasoning. The experimental results demonstrate that KaSA consistently outperforms FFT and 14 popular PEFT baselines across 16 benchmarks and 4 synthetic datasets, underscoring our method's efficacy and adaptability.

The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on language model estimation has been investigated primarily through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers and, most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. In addition, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, finiteness, and sequentiality. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future theoretical and empirical research",

A prime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the video understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly trained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in real-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the informational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to assess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the best-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due to a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to identify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose alignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the ability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and appropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the video, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics designed to measure model behavior before and after alignment.

We define an algorithm $A$ for MAB to be $(\\ell,\\delta)$-list replicable if with probability at least $1-\\delta$, $A$ has at most $\\ell$ traces in independent executions even with different random bits, where a trace means sequence of arms played during an execution. For $k$-armed bandits, although the total number of traces can be $\\Omega(k^T)$ for a time horizon $T$, we present several surprising upper bounds that either independent of or logarithmic of $T$: (1) a $(2^{k},\\delta)$-list replicable algorithm with near-optimal regret, $\\widetilde{O}({\\sqrt{kT}})$, (2) a $(O(k/\\delta),\\delta)$-list replicable algorithm with regret $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{k}{\\delta}\\sqrt{kT}\\right)$, (3) a $((k+1)^{B-1}, \\delta)$-list replicable algorithm with regret $\\widetilde{O}(k^{\\frac{3}{2}}T^{{\\frac{1}{2}}+2^{-(B+1)}})$ for any integer $B>1$.

This is optimal in list complexity in the sub-linear regret regime as there is a $(k, 0)$-list replicable algorithm with $O(T^{2/3})$-regret.

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "As AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications, ensuring their interpretability is essential. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to reverse-engineer neural networks by extracting human-understandable algorithms embedded within their structures to explain their behavior. This work systematically examines a fundamental question: for a fixed behavior to explain, and under the criteria that MI sets for itself, are we guaranteed a unique explanation? Drawing an analogy with the concept of identifiability in statistics, which ensures the uniqueness of parameters inferred from data under specific modeling assumptions, we speak about the identifiability of explanations produced by MI. We identify two broad strategies to produce MI explanations: (i) \"where-then-what\", which first identifies a subset of the network (a circuit) that replicates the model's behavior before deriving its interpretation, and (ii) \"what-then-where\", which begins with candidate explanatory algorithms and searches in the activation subspaces of the neural model where the candidate algorithm may be implemented, relying on notions of causal alignment between the states of the candidate algorithm and the neural network. We systematically test the identifiability of both strategies using simple tasks (learning Boolean functions) and multi-layer perceptrons small enough to allow a complete enumeration of candidate explanations. Our experiments reveal overwhelming evidence of non-identifiability in all cases: multiple circuits can replicate model behavior, multiple interpretations can exist for a circuit, several algorithms can be causally aligned with the neural network, and a single algorithm can be causally aligned with different subspaces of the network. We discuss whether the unicity intuition is necessary. One could adopt a pragmatic stance, requiring explanations only to meet predictive and/or manipulability standards. However, if unicity is considered essential, e.g., to provide a sense of understanding, we also discuss less permissive criteria. Finally, we also refer to the inner interpretability framework that demands explanations to be validated by multiple complementary criteria.

Generaliz- ing counting inductively is central to task success on out-of-distribution (OOD) instances where testing inputs are longer than those seen in training. While there is a large body of literature reporting poor length generalization in language models, few papers have tried to distill the \"reasoning\" failure to the simplest case of count- ing failure. We aim to provide a broader picture on whether various language model architectures can a) learn to count, and b) generalize counting inductively. This work provides extensive empirical results on architectures ranging from RNNs, Transformers, State-Space Models and RWKV. We present carefully-designed task formats, auxiliary tasks and positional embeddings to avoid limitations in general- ization with OOD-position and OOD-vocabulary. We find that while traditional RNNs trivially achieve inductive counting, Transformers have to rely on positional embeddings (PEs) to count OOD. Further analyses on interpreting the learned solution reveal that different PEs encode different inductive biases that facilitate counting in different task formats. As counting is the basis for many arguments concerning the expressivity of Transformers, our finding calls for the community to reexamine the application scope of primitive functions defined in formal charac- terizations. Finally, modern RNNs also largely underperform traditional RNNs in generalizing counting inductively, hinting at the tradeoff modern RNNs struggle to balance between parallelized training and maintaining their recurrent nature",

However, real-world navigation robots often operate in persistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual observations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task setting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating continuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these real-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN (General Scene Adaptation for VLN), a novel task requiring agents to execute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously adapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task, one has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each scene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly expands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts. Furthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing techniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is motivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent signatures or preferences in their instructions, taking the use case of home robotic assistants as an example. We conducted extensive experiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various methods, revealing key factors enabling agents to adapt to specific environments.

However, like the classical OT problem, GW imposes an equal mass constraint between measures, which restricts its application in many machine learning tasks. To address this limitation, the partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem has been introduced. It relaxes the equal mass constraint, allowing the comparison of general positive Radon measures. Despite this, both GW and PGW face significant computational challenges due to their non-convex nature. To overcome these challenges, we propose the linear partial Gromov-Wasserstein (LPGW) embedding, a linearized embedding technique for the PGW problem. For $K$ different metric measure spaces, the pairwise computation of the PGW distance requires solving the PGW problem $\\mathcal{O}(K^2)$ times. In contrast, the proposed linearization technique reduces this to $\\mathcal{O}(K)$ times. Similar to the linearization technique for the classical OT problem, we prove that LPGW defines a valid metric for metric measure spaces. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of LPGW in practical applications such as shape retrieval and learning with transport-based embeddings, showing that LPGW preserves the advantages of PGW in partial matching while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

To address this, we propose a novel LLM alignment loss that establishes a stable Bidirectional Negative Feedback (BNF) during optimization. Our proposed BNF loss eliminates the need for pairwise contrastive losses and does not require any extra tunable hyper-parameters or pairwise preference data, streamlining the alignment pipeline to be as simple as supervised fine-tuning. We conduct extensive experiments across two challenging QA benchmarks and four reasoning benchmarks. The experimental results show that BNF achieves comparable performance to the best methods on QA benchmarks, while its performance decrease on the four reasoning benchmarks is significantly lower compared to the best methods, thus striking a better balance between value alignment and reasoning ability. In addition, we further validate the performance of BNF on non-pairwise datasets, and conduct in-depth analysis of log-likelihood and logit shifts across different preference optimization methods. We will release all the source code, checkpoints, and datasets on GitHub",

    "abstract": "Obtaining the desired effect of drugs is highly dependent on their molecular geometries. Thus, the current prevailing paradigm focuses on 3D point-cloud atom representations, utilizing graph neural network (GNN) parametrizations, with rotational symmetries baked in via E(3) invariant layers. We prove that such models must necessarily disregard chirality, a geometric property of the molecules that cannot be superimposed on their mirror image by rotation and translation. Chirality plays a key role in determining drug safety and potency. To address this glaring issue, we introduce a novel field-based representation, proposing reference rotations that replace rotational symmetry constraints. The proposed model captures all molecular geometries including chirality, while still achieving highly competitive performance with E(3)-based methods across standard benchmarking metrics",

    "title": "One Model Transfer to All: On Robust Jailbreak Prompts Generation against LLMs",
    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes, rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts",

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) is the leading non-invasive technique for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, with widespread adoption in both clinical settings and consumer wearable devices. While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models. PaPaGei can serve as both a feature extractor and an encoder for multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring.

    "abstract": "Parametric differential equations of the form $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = f(u, x, t, p)$ are fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) efficiently approximate differential equation solutions, they struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity calculations $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial p}$, and concept drift. We address these challenges by introducing a novel sensitivity loss regularizer, demonstrated through Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO). Our approach maintains high accuracy for solution paths and outperforms both standard FNO and FNO with Physics-Informed Neural Network regularization. SC-FNO exhibits superior performance in parameter inversion tasks, accommodates more complex parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), reduces training data requirements, and decreases training time while maintaining accuracy. These improvements apply across various differential equations and neural operators, enhancing their reliability without significant computational overhead (30%–130% extra training time per epoch).

    "volume": "poster",
    "abstract": "Multi-modal models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated strong performance in aligning visual and textual representations, excelling in tasks like image retrieval and zero-shot classification. Despite this success, the mechanisms by which these models utilize training data, particularly the role of memorization, remain unclear. In uni-modal models, both supervised and self-supervised, memorization has been shown to be essential for generalization. However, it is not well understood how these findings would apply to CLIP, which incorporates elements from both supervised learning via captions that provide a supervisory signal similar to labels, and from self-supervised learning via the contrastive objective. To bridge this gap in understanding, we propose a formal definition of memorization in CLIP (CLIPMem) and use it to quantify memorization in CLIP models. Our results indicate that CLIP's memorization behavior falls between the supervised and self-supervised paradigms, with \"mis-captioned\" samples exhibiting highest levels of memorization. Additionally, we find that the text encoder contributes more to memorization than the image encoder, suggesting that mitigation strategies should focus on the text domain. Building on these insights, we propose multiple strategies to reduce memorization while at the same time improving utility---something that had not been shown before for traditional learning paradigms where reducing memorization typically results in utility decrease",
