    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Labeling data via rules-of-thumb and minimal label supervision is central to Weak Supervision, a paradigm subsuming subareas of machine learning such as crowdsourced learning and semi-supervised ensemble learning. By using this labeled data to train modern machine learning methods, the cost of acquiring large amounts of hand labeled data can be ameliorated. Approaches to combining the rules-of-thumb falls into two camps, reflecting different ideologies of statistical estimation. The most common approach, exemplified by the Dawid-Skene model, is based on probabilistic modeling. The other, developed in the work of Balsubramani-Freund and others, is adversarial and game-theoretic. We provide a variety of statistical results for the adversarial approach under log-loss: we characterize the form of the solution, relate it to logistic regression, demonstrate consistency, and give rates of convergence. On the other hand, we find that probabilistic approaches for the same model class can fail to be consistent. Experimental results are provided to corroborate the theoretical results",

    "abstract": "Data assimilation (DA) methods use priors arising from differential equations to robustly interpolate and extrapolate data. Popular techniques such as ensemble methods that handle high-dimensional, nonlinear PDE priors focus mostly on state estimation, however can have difficulty learning the parameters accurately. On the other hand, machine learning based approaches can naturally learn the state and parameters, but their applicability can be limited, or produce uncertainties that are hard to interpret. Inspired by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) method in spatial statistics, we propose an alternative approach to DA based on iteratively linearising the dynamical model. This produces a Gaussian Markov random field at each iteration, enabling one to use INLA to infer the state and parameters. Our approach can be used for arbitrary nonlinear systems, while retaining interpretability, and is furthermore demonstrated to outperform existing methods on the DA task. By providing a more nuanced approach to handling nonlinear PDE priors, our methodology offers improved accuracy and robustness in predictions, especially where data sparsity is prevalent",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the impressive capability of large language models (LLMs), knowing when to trust their generations remains an open challenge. The recent literature on uncertainty quantification of natural language generation (NLG) utilizes a conventional natural language inference (NLI) classifier to measure the semantic dispersion of LLMs responses. These studies employ logits of NLI classifier for semantic clustering to estimate uncertainty. However, logits represent the probability of the predicted class and barely contain feature information for potential clustering. Alternatively, CLIP (Contrastive Language{–}Image Pre-training) performs impressively in extracting image-text pair features and measuring their similarity. To extend its usability, we propose Contrastive Semantic Similarity, the CLIP-based feature extraction module to obtain similarity features for measuring uncertainty for text pairs. We apply this method to selective NLG, which detects and rejects unreliable generations for better trustworthiness of LLMs. We conduct extensive experiments with three LLMs on several benchmark question-answering datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Results show that our proposed method performs better in estimating reliable responses of LLMs than comparable baselines",

    "abstract": "Off-policy learning (OPL) often involves minimizing a risk estimator based on importance weighting to correct bias from the logging policy used to collect data. However, this method can produce an estimator with a high variance. A common solution is to regularize the importance weights and learn the policy by minimizing an estimator with penalties derived from generalization bounds specific to the estimator. This approach, known as pessimism, has gained recent attention but lacks a unified framework for analysis. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive PAC-Bayesian framework to examine pessimism with regularized importance weighting. We derive a tractable PAC-Bayesian generalization bound that universally applies to common importance weight regularizations, enabling their comparison within a single framework.

    "abstract": "Distribution shift detection is paramount in safety-critical tasks that rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The detection task entails deriving a confidence score to assert whether a new input sample aligns with the training data distribution of the DNN model. While DNN predictive uncertainty offers an intuitive confidence measure, exploring uncertainty-based distribution shift detection with simple sample-based techniques has been relatively overlooked in recent years due to computational overhead and lower performance than plain post-hoc methods. This paper proposes using simple sample-based techniques for estimating uncertainty and employing the entropy density from intermediate representations to detect distribution shifts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using standard benchmark datasets for out-of-distribution detection and across different common perception tasks with convolutional neural network architectures. Our scope extends beyond classification, encompassing image-level distribution shift detection for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Our results show that our method's performance is comparable to existing State-of-the-Art methods while being computationally faster and lighter than other Bayesian approaches, affirming its practical utility",

Much of the existing work in FL focuses on efficiently learning a model for a single task. In this paper, we study simultaneous training of multiple FL models using a common set of clients. The few existing simultaneous training methods employ synchronous aggregation of client updates, which can cause significant delays because large models and/or slow clients can bottleneck the aggregation. On the other hand, a naive asynchronous aggregation is adversely affected by stale client updates. We propose FedAST, a buffered asynchronous federated simultaneous training algorithm that overcomes bottlenecks from slow models and adaptively allocates client resources across heterogeneous tasks. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for FedAST for smooth non-convex objective functions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing simultaneous FL approaches, achieving up to 46.0% reduction in time to train multiple tasks to completion",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the Mechanism Design aspects of the $m$-Capacitated Facility Location Problem where the total facility capacity is lower than the number of agents. Following \\cite{aziz2020capacity}, the Social Welfare of the facility location is determined through a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) game where agents compete after the facility positions are established. When the number of facilities is $m>1$, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the FCFS game is not unique, thus the utility of the agents and the notion of truthfulness are not well-defined. To address these issues, we consider absolutely truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms able to prevent agents from misreporting regardless of the strategies played during the FCFS game. We pair this more stringent truthfulness requirement with the notion of Equilibrium Stable (ES) mechanism, i.e. mechanisms whose Social Welfare does not depend on the NE of the FCFS game. We show that the class of percentile mechanisms is absolutely truthful and characterize under which conditions they are ES. We then show that the approximation ratio of each ES percentile mechanism is bounded and determine its value. Notably, when all the facilities have the same capacity and the number of agents is large enough, it is possible to achieve an approximation ratio smaller than $1+\\frac{1}{2m-1}$. We enhance our findings by empirically evaluating the mechanisms' performances when agents' true positions follows a distribution",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) instances is crucial for the reliable deployment of machine learning models in real-world scenarios. OOD inputs are commonly expected to cause a more uncertain prediction in the primary task; however, there are OOD cases for which the model returns a highly confident prediction. This phenomenon, denoted as \"overconfidence\", presents a challenge to OOD detection. Specifically, theoretical evidence indicates that overconfidence is an intrinsic property of certain neural network architectures, leading to poor OOD detection. In this work, we address this issue by measuring extreme activation values in the penultimate layer of neural networks and then leverage this proxy of overconfidence to improve on several OOD detection baselines. We test our method on a wide array of experiments spanning synthetic data and real-world data, tabular and image datasets, multiple architectures such as ResNet and Transformer, different training loss functions, and include the scenarios examined in previous theoretical work. Compared to the baselines, our method often grants substantial improvements, with double-digit increases in OOD detection AUC, and it does not damage performance in any scenario",

We first propose two efficient frameworks for adversarial MDPs, spanning full-information and bandit settings. Within each framework, we consider both Joint DP (JDP), where a central agent is trusted to protect the sensitive data, and Local DP (LDP), where the information is protected directly on the user side. Then, we design novel privacy mechanisms to privatize the stochastic transition and adversarial losses. By instantiating such privacy mechanisms to satisfy JDP and LDP requirements, we obtain near-optimal regret guarantees for both frameworks.

    "abstract": "The goal of Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is recovering a posterior distribution over reward functions using a set of demonstrations from an expert optimizing for a reward unknown to the learner. The resulting posterior over rewards can then be used to synthesize an apprentice policy that performs well on the same or a similar task. A key challenge in Bayesian IRL is bridging the computational gap between the hypothesis space of possible rewards and the likelihood, often defined in terms of Q values: vanilla Bayesian IRL needs to solve the costly forward planning problem – going from rewards to the Q values – at every step of the algorithm, which may need to be done thousands of times. We propose to solve this by a simple change: instead of focusing on primarily sampling in the space of rewards, we can focus on primarily working in the space of Q-values, since the computation required to go from Q-values to reward is radically cheaper. Furthermore, this reversion of the computation makes it easy to compute the gradient allowing efficient sampling using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.

We further consider the problem of tuning hyperparameters in pruning the decision tree for classical pruning algorithms including min-cost complexity pruning. We also study the interpretability of the learned decision trees and introduce a data-driven approach for optimizing the explainability versus accuracy trade-off using decision trees.

It is well established that in general such questions cannot be answered definitively from observational data.

In practice, this paradigm is still too rigid for many practical applications as it is generally not possible to confidently delineate the true causal diagram. In this paper, we consider the derivation of bounds on causal effects given only observational data. We propose to take as input a less informative structure known as a Partial Ancestral Graph, which represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams and is learnable from data. In this more \"data-driven\" setting, we provide a systematic algorithm to derive bounds on causal effects that exploit the invariant properties of the equivalence class, and that can be computed analytically.

The primary challenge in such an extension lies in managing the exponentially increasing noise associated with LDP as the size of the subgraph grows. Our solution involves an algorithm for publishing the count of walks originating from each node in the graph, which subsequently enables us to publish the Katz centrality of all nodes. This algorithm incorporates multiple communication rounds and employs a clipping technique. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves has a relatively small bias and variance, showing significant improvements over both the randomized response method and non-clipping algorithms.

Recent work, however, indicates that importance sampling scales poorly — in order to accurately approximate the true posterior, the required number of importance samples grows is exponential in the number of latent variables [Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018]. Massively parallel importance sampling works around this issue by drawing $K$ samples for each of the $n$ latent variables and reasoning about all $K^n$ combinations of latent samples. In principle, we can reason efficiently over $K^n$ combinations of samples by exploiting conditional independencies in the generative model. However, in practice this requires complex algorithms that traverse backwards through the graphical model, and we need separate backward traversals for each computation (posterior expectations, marginals and samples). Our contribution is to exploit the source term trick from physics to entirely avoid the need to hand-write backward traversals. Instead, we demonstrate how to simply and easily compute all the required quantities — posterior expectations, marginals and samples — by differentiating through a slightly modified marginal likelihood estimator",

    "title": "Revisiting Kernel Attention with Correlated Gaussian Process Representation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transformers have increasingly become the de facto method to model sequential data with state-of-the-art performance. Due to its widespread use, being able to estimate and calibrate its modeling uncertainty is important to understand and design robust transformer models. To achieve this, previous works have used Gaussian processes (GPs) to perform uncertainty calibration for the attention units of transformers and attained notable successes. However, such approaches have to confine the transformers to the space of symmetric attention to ensure the necessary symmetric requirement of their GP's kernel specification, which reduces the representation capacity of the model. To mitigate this restriction, we propose the Correlated Gaussian Process Transformer (CGPT), a new class of transformers whose self-attention units are modeled as cross-covariance between two correlated GPs (CGPs). This allows asymmetries in attention and can enhance the representation capacity of GP-based transformers. We also derive a sparse approximation for CGP to make it scale better. Our empirical studies show that both CGP-based and sparse CGP-based transformers achieve better performance than state-of-the-art GP-based transformers on a variety of benchmark tasks",

    "abstract": "Black-box variational inference (BBVI) is a general-purpose approximate inference approach that converts inference to a stochastic optimization problem. However, the difficulty of solving the BBVI optimization problem reliably and robustly using stochastic gradient methods has limited its applicability. We present a novel optimization approach for BBVI using the sample average approximation (SAA). SAA converts stochastic problems to deterministic ones by optimizing over a fixed random sample, which enables optimization tools such as quasi-Newton methods and line search that bypass the difficulties faced by stochastic gradient methods. We design an approach called \"SAA for VI\" that solves a sequence of SAA problems with increasing sample sizes to reliably and robustly solve BBVI problems without problem-specific tuning. We focus on quasi-Newton methods, which are well suited to problems with up to hundreds of latent variables. Our experiments show that SAA for VI simplifies the VI problem and achieves faster performance than existing methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Differential privacy mechanisms such as the Gaussian or Laplace mechanism have been widely used in data analytics for preserving individual privacy. However, they are mostly designed for continuous outputs and are unsuitable for scenarios where discrete values are necessary. Although various quantization mechanisms were proposed recently to generate discrete outputs under differential privacy, the outcomes are either biased or have an inferior accuracy-privacy trade-off. In this paper, we propose a family of quantization mechanisms that is unbiased and differentially private. It has a high degree of freedom and we show that some existing mechanisms can be considered as special cases of ours. To find the optimal mechanism, we formulate a linear optimization that can be solved efficiently using linear programming tools. Experiments show that our proposed mechanism can attain a better privacy-accuracy trade-off compared to baselines",

    "title": "Fair Active Learning in Low-Data Regimes",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In critical machine learning applications, ensuring fairness is essential to avoid perpetuating social inequities. In this work, we address the challenges of reducing bias and improving accuracy in data-scarce environments, where the cost of collecting labeled data prohibits the use of large, labeled datasets. In such settings, active learning promises to maximize marginal accuracy gains of small amounts of labeled data. However, existing applications of active learning for fairness fail to deliver on this, typically requiring large labeled datasets, or failing to ensure the desired fairness tolerance is met on the population distribution. To address such limitations, we introduce an innovative active learning framework that combines an exploration procedure inspired by posterior sampling with a fair classification subroutine. We demonstrate that this framework performs effectively in very data-scarce regimes, maximizing accuracy while satisfying fairness constraints with high probability. We evaluate our proposed approach using well-established real-world benchmark datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing fair models, and improvement over existing methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Structural Entropy (SE) measures the structural information contained in a graph. Minimizing or maximizing SE helps to reveal or obscure the intrinsic structural patterns underlying graphs in an interpretable manner, finding applications in various tasks driven by networked data. However, SE ignores the heterogeneity inherent in the graph relations, which is ubiquitous in modern networks. In this work, we extend SE to consider heterogeneous relations and propose the first metric for multi-relational graph structural information, namely, Multi-relational Structural Entropy (MrSE). To this end, we first cast SE through the novel lens of the stationary distribution from random surfing, which readily extends to multi-relational networks by considering the choices of both nodes and relation types simultaneously at each step. The resulting MrSE is then optimized by a new greedy algorithm to reveal the essential structures within a multi-relational network. Experimental results highlight that the proposed MrSE offers a more insightful interpretation of the structure of multi-relational graphs compared to SE. Additionally, it enhances the performance of two tasks that involve real-world multi-relational graphs, including node clustering and social event detection",

    "title": "How to Fix a Broken Confidence Estimator: Evaluating Post-hoc Methods for Selective Classification with Deep Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of selective classification for deep neural networks, where a model is allowed to abstain from low-confidence predictions to avoid potential errors. We focus on so-called post-hoc methods, which replace the confidence estimator of a given classifier without modifying or retraining it, thus being practically appealing. Considering neural networks with softmax outputs, our goal is to identify the best confidence estimator that can be computed directly from the unnormalized logits. This problem is motivated by the intriguing observation in recent work that many classifiers appear to have a \"broken\" confidence estimator, in the sense that their selective classification performance is much worse than what could be expected by their corresponding accuracies. We perform an extensive experimental study of many existing and proposed confidence estimators applied to 84 pretrained ImageNet classifiers available from popular repositories. Our results show that a simple $p$-norm normalization of the logits, followed by taking the maximum logit as the confidence estimator, can lead to considerable gains in selective classification performance, completely fixing the pathological behavior observed in many classifiers. As a consequence, the selective classification performance of any classifier becomes almost entirely determined by its corresponding accuracy. Moreover, these results are shown to be consistent under distribution shift",

    "title": "QuantProb: Generalizing Probabilities along with Predictions for a Pre-trained Classifier",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Quantification of Uncertainty in predictions is a challenging problem. In the classification settings, although deep learning based models generalize well, class probabilities often lack reliability. Calibration errors are used to quantify uncertainty, and several methods exist to minimize calibration error. We argue that between the choice of having a minimum calibration error on original distribution which increases across distortions or having a (possibly slightly higher) calibration error which is constant across distortions, we prefer the latter We hypothesize that the reason for unreliability of deep networks is - The way neural networks are currently trained, the probabilities do not generalize across small distortions. We observe that quantile based approaches can potentially solve this problem. We propose an innovative approach to decouple the construction of quantile representations from the loss function allowing us to compute quantile based probabilities without disturbing the original network. We achieve this by establishing a novel duality property between quantiles and probabilities, and an ability to obtain quantile probabilities from any pre-trained classifier. While post-hoc calibration techniques successfully minimize calibration errors, they do not preserve robustness to distortions. We show that, Quantile probabilities (QuantProb), obtained from Quantile representations, preserve the calibration errors across distortions, since quantile probabilities generalize better than the naive Softmax probabilities",

    "title": "Generalization and Learnability in Multiple Instance Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multiple instance regression (MIR) was introduced by Ray and Page (2001) as an analogue of multiple instance learning (MIL) in which we are given bags of feature-vectors (instances) and for each bag there is a bag-label which matches the label of one (unknown) primary instance from that bag. The goal is to compute a hypothesis regressor consistent with the underlying instance-labels. A natural approach is to find the best primary instance assignment and regressor optimizing the mse loss on the bags though no formal generalization guarantees were known. Our work is the first to prove generalization error bounds for MIR when the bags are drawn i.i.d. at random. Essentially, with high probability any MIR regressor with low error on sampled bags also has low error on the underlying instance-label distribution. We next study the complexity of linear regression on MIR bags, shown to be NP-hard in general by Ray and Page (2001), who however left open the possibility of arbitrarily good approximations. Significantly strengthening previous work, we prove a strong inapproximability bound: even if there exists zero bag-loss MIR linear regressor on a collection of $2$-sized bags with labels in $[-1,1]$, it is NP-hard to find an MIR linear regressor with bag-loss $< C$ for some absolute constant $C > 0$. Our work also proposes a model training method for MIR based on a novel weighted assignment loss, geared towards handling overlapping bags which have not received much attention previously. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets showing that our method outperforms the baseline MIR methods",
