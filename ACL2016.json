We normalize the model ofﬂine in advance, which is efﬁcient due to a recurrence relationship between the normalizing factors. To tune interpolation weights, we apply Newton's method to this convex problem and show that the derivatives can be computed efﬁciently in a batch process. These ﬁnd-ings are combined in new open-source interpolation tool, which is distributed with KenLM.

We propose different methods through which word embeddings can be leveraged in a state-of-the-art supervised WSD system architecture, and perform a deep analysis of how different parameters affect performance.

Averaging the embeddings of words in a sentence has proven to be a surprisingly successful and efficient way of obtaining sentence embeddings. However, word embeddings trained with the methods currently available are not optimized for the task of sentence representation, and, thus, likely to be suboptimal. Siamese CBOW handles this problem by training word embeddings directly for the purpose of being averaged. The underlying neural network learns word embeddings by predicting, from a sentence representation, its surrounding sentences. We show the robustness of the Siamese CBOW model by evaluating it on 20 datasets stemming from a wide variety of sources",

We operationalize this principle for semantic parsing, the task of mapping utterances to logical forms. We develop a simple, efficient method that reasons over the infinite set of all consistent models by only checking two of the models.

    "abstract": "Nearly all previous work on neural machine translation (NMT) has used quite restricted vocabularies, perhaps with a subsequent method to patch in unknown words. This paper presents a novel word-character solution to achieving open vocabulary NMT. We build hybrid systems that translate mostly at the word level and consult the character components for rare words. Our character-level recurrent neural networks compute source word representations and recover unknown target words when needed. The twofold advantage of such a hybrid approach is that it is much faster and easier to train than character-based ones; at the same time, it never produces unknown words as in the case of word-based models. On the WMT'15 English to Czech translation task, this hybrid approach offers an addition boost of +2.1-11.4 BLEU points over models that already handle unknown words. Our best system achieves a new state-of-the-art result with 20.7 BLEU score. We demonstrate that our character models can successfully learn to not only generate well-formed words for Czech, a highly-inflected language with a very complex vocabulary, but also build correct representations for English source words",

In this paper, we introduce a novel neutral network architecture that benefits from both word- and character-level representations automatically, by using combination of bidirectional LSTM, CNN and CRF. Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data pre-processing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks --- Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER).

    "title": "Off-topic Response Detection for Spontaneous Spoken English Assessment",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "© 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics. Automatic spoken language assessment systems are becoming increasingly important to meet the demand for English second language learning. This is a challenging task due to the high error rates of, even state-of-the-art, non-native speech recognition. Consequently current systems primarily assess fluency and pronunciation. However, content assessment is essential for full automation. As a first stage it is important to judge whether the speaker responds on topic to test questions designed to elicit spontaneous speech. Standard approaches to off-topic response detection assess similarity between the response and question based on bag-of-words representations. An alternative framework based on Recurrent Neural Network Language Models (RNNLM) is proposed in this paper. The RNNLM is adapted to the topic of each test question. It learns to associate example responses to questions with points in a topic space constructed using these example responses. Classification is done by ranking the topic-conditional posterior probabilities of a response. The RNNLMs associate a broad range of responses with each topic, incorporate sequence information and scale better with additional training data, unlike standard methods. On experiments conducted on data from the Business Language Testing Service (BULATS) this approach outperforms standard approaches",

We present a simple and effective approach that deals with this problem in two phases. First, we build a classifier that identifies spans of the input text that can be translated into a single compound word in the target language. Then, for each identified span, we generate a pool of possible compounds which are added to the translation model as \"synthetic\" phrase translations. Experiments reveal that (i) we can effectively predict what spans can be compounded; (ii) our compound generation model produces good compounds; and (iii) modest improvements are possible in end-to-end English‐German and English‐Finnish translation tasks. We additionally introduce KomposEval, a new multi-reference dataset of English phrases and their translations into German compounds",

Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem, and its importance for NLP applications such as review summarization, dialog systems and sentiment analysis is well recognized. Sarcasm can often be traced to incongruity that becomes apparent as the full sentence unfolds. This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way readers eyes move through the text. We observe the difference in the behaviour of the eye, while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences. Motivated by this observation, we augment traditional linguistic and stylistic features for sarcasm detection with the cognitive features obtained from readers eye movement data. We perform statistical classification using the enhanced feature set so obtained. The augmented cognitive features improve sarcasm detection by 3.7% (in terms of Fscore), over the performance of the best reported system",

We evaluate the resulting system on three datasets of increasing size and complexity, the largest of which has a vocabulary of about 10K words, a grammar of about 32K lexicalized trees and a world with about 11K entities and 23K relations between them. Our results show that the system has a median generation time of 8.5s and finds the best sentence on average within 25s.

In addition, when identifying and classifying arguments, previous works consider each candidate argument separately while ignoring the relationship between arguments. This paper proposes a Regularization-Based Pattern Balancing Method (RBPB). Inspired by the progress in representation learning, we use trigger embedding, sentence-level embedding and pattern features together as our features for trigger classification so that the effect of patterns and other useful features can be balanced. In addition, RBPB uses a regularization method to take advantage of the relationship between arguments. Experiments show that we achieve results better than current state-of-art equivalents",

    "title": "Knowledge Base Completion via Coupled Path Ranking",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Knowledge bases (KBs) are often greatly incomplete, necessitating a demand for KB completion. The path ranking algorithm (PRA) is one of the most promising approaches to this task. Previous work on PRA usually follows a single-task learning paradigm, building a prediction model for each relation independently with its own training data. It ignores meaningful associations among certain relations, and might not get enough training data for less frequent relations. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework for PRA, referred to as coupled PRA (CPRA). It first devises an agglomerative clustering strategy to automatically discover relations that are highly correlated to each other, and then employs a multi-task learning strategy to effectively couple the prediction of such relations. As such, CPRA takes into account relation association and enables implicit data sharing among them. We empirically evaluate CPRA on benchmark data created from Freebase. Experimental results show that CPRA can effectively identify coherent clusters in which relations are highly correlated. By further coupling such relations, CPRA significantly outperforms PRA, in terms of both predictive accuracy and model interpretability",

We introduce a late fusion approach to a recurrent language model based on long shortterm memory units (LSTM), which helps the LSTM unit keep intra-sentence dependencies and inter-sentence dependencies separate from each other. Through the evaluation on four corpora (IMDB, BBC, Penn TreeBank, and Fil9), we demonstrate that the proposed model improves perplexity significantly. In the experiments, we evaluate the proposed approach while varying the number of context sentences and observe that the proposed late fusion is superior to the usual way of incorporating additional inputs to the LSTM. By analyzing the trained larger-context language model, we discover that content words, including nouns, adjectives and verbs, benefit most from an increasing number of context sentences. This analysis suggests that larger-context language model improves the unconditional language model by capturing the theme of a document better and more easily",

However, the significance of privacy policies greatly exceeds the attention paid to them: these documents are binding legal agreements between website operators and their users, and their opaqueness is a challenge not only to Internet users but also to policy regulators. One proposed alternative to the status quo is to automate or semi-automate the extraction of salient details from privacy policy text, using a combination of crowdsourcing, natural language processing, and machine learning. However, there has been a relative dearth of datasets appropriate for identifying data practices in privacy policies. To remedy this problem, we introduce a corpus of 115 privacy policies (267K words) with manual annotations for 23K fine-grained data practices. We describe the process of using skilled annotators and a purpose-built annotation tool to produce the data. We provide findings based on a census of the annotations and show results toward automating the annotation procedure. Finally, we describe challenges and opportunities for the research community to use this corpus to advance research in both privacy and language technologies",

In order to use sequence prediction, we need to sequentialize these logical forms. We compare three sequentializations: a direct linearization of the logical form, a linearization of the associated canonical realization, and a sequence consisting of derivation steps relative to the underlying grammar. We also show how grammatical constraints on the derivation sequence can easily be integrated inside the RNN-based sequential predictor. Our experiments show important improvements over previous results for the same dataset, and also demonstrate the advantage of incorporating the grammatical constraints",

In contrast to existing maximum entropy based rule selection (MERS) models, which use discrete representations of words as features, the CSRS model is learned by a feed-forward neural network and uses real-valued vector representations of words, allowing for better generalization. In addition, we propose a method to train the rule selection models only on minimal rules, which are more frequent and have richer training data compared to non-minimal rules. We tested our model on different translation tasks and the CSRS model outperformed a baseline without rule selection and the previous MERS model by up to 2.2 and 1.1 points of BLEU score respectively",

We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change",

LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text",

The task is to predict textual values from the structured knowledge base Wikidata by reading the text of the corresponding Wikipedia articles. The task contains a rich variety of challenging classification and extraction sub-tasks, making it well-suited for end-to-end models such as deep neural networks (DNNs). We compare various state-of-the-art DNNbased architectures for document classification, information extraction, and question answering. We find that models supporting a rich answer space, such as word or character sequences, perform best.

A similar phenomenon is observable in human language communication. For example, humans tend to repeat entity names or even long phrases in conversation. The challenge with regard to copying in Seq2Seq is that new machinery is needed to decide when to perform the operation. In this paper, we incorporate copying into neural network-based Seq2Seq learning and propose a new model called CopyNet with encoder-decoder structure. CopyNet can nicely integrate the regular way of word generation in the decoder with the new copying mechanism which can choose sub-sequences in the input sequence and put them at proper places in the output sequence. Our empirical study on both synthetic data sets and real world data sets demonstrates the efficacy of CopyNet. For example, CopyNet can outperform regular RNN-based model with remarkable margins on text summarization tasks",

However, several applications encounter scenarios where models need to transfer/adapt across domains when the label sets vary both in terms of count of labels as well as their connotations. This paper presents first-of-its-kind transfer learning algorithm for cross-domain classification with multiple source domains and disparate label sets. It starts with identifying transferable knowledge from across multiple domains that can be useful for learning the target domain task. This knowledge in the form of selective labeled instances from different domains is congregated to form an auxiliary training set which is used for learning the target domain task.

For instance, each count noun in Czech has 12 forms (where English uses only singular and plural). Even in large corpora, we are unlikely to observe all inflections of a given lemma. This reduces the vocabulary coverage of methods that induce continuous representations for words from distributional corpus information. We solve this problem by exploiting existing morphological resources that can enumerate a word's component morphemes. We present a latentvariable Gaussian graphical model that allows us to extrapolate continuous representations for words not observed in the training corpus, as well as smoothing the representations provided for the observed words. The latent variables represent embeddings of morphemes, which combine to create embeddings of words. Over several languages and training sizes, our model improves the embeddings for words, when evaluated on an analogy task, skip-gram predictive accuracy, and word similarity",

This is based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 1.1 and 1.3 BLEU, respectively",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "This paper describes the first robust approach to automatically labeling clauses with their situation entity type (Smith, 2003), capturing aspectual phenomena at the clause level which are relevant for interpreting both semantics at the clause level and discourse structure. Previous work on this task used a small data set from a limited domain, and relied mainly on words as features, an approach which is impractical in larger settings. We provide a new corpus of texts from 13 genres (40,000 clauses) annotated with situation entity types. We show that our sequence labeling approach using distributional information in the form of Brown clusters, as well as syntactic-semantic features targeted to the task, is robust across genres, reaching accuracies of up to 76%",

While individual details vary, there are characteristic patterns that are specific to each of these scenarios. For example, a wedding typically consists of a sequence of events such as walking down the aisle, exchanging vows, and dancing. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to learning event knowledge from a large collection of photo albums. We formulate the task as constrained optimization to induce the prototypical temporal structure of an event, integrating both visual and textual cues. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that it is possible to learn multimodal knowledge of event structure from noisy web content",

    "abstract": "Automatically generating a natural language description of an image is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. This task involves both computer vision and natural language processing and is called \"image caption generation.\" Research on image caption generation has typically focused on taking in an image and generating a caption in English as existing image caption corpora are mostly in English. The lack of corpora in languages other than English is an issue, especially for morphologically rich languages such as Japanese. There is thus a need for corpora sufficiently large for image captioning in other languages. We have developed a Japanese version of the MS COCO caption dataset and a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that takes in an image and uses this Japanese version of the dataset to generate a caption in Japanese. As the Japanese portion of the corpus is small, our model was designed to transfer the knowledge representation obtained from the English portion into the Japanese portion. Experiments showed that the resulting bilingual comparable corpus has better performance than a monolingual corpus, indicating that image understanding using a resource-rich language benefits a resource-poor language",

    "abstract": "There has been an explosion of work in the vision & language community during the past few years from image captioning to video transcription, and answering questions about images. These tasks have focused on literal descriptions of the image. To move beyond the literal, we choose to explore how questions about an image are often directed at commonsense inference and the abstract events evoked by objects in the image. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Visual Question Generation (VQG), where the system is tasked with asking a natural and engaging question when shown an image. We provide three datasets which cover a variety of images from object-centric to event-centric, with considerably more abstract training data than provided to state-of-the-art captioning systems thus far. We train and test several generative and retrieval models to tackle the task of VQG. Evaluation results show that while such models ask reasonable questions for a variety of images, there is still a wide gap with human performance which motivates further work on connecting images with commonsense knowledge and pragmatics. Our proposed task offers a new challenge to the community which we hope furthers interest in exploring deeper connections between vision & language",

We first conducted a crowdsourcing experiment and identified eighteen categories of physical causality for action verbs. For a subset of these categories, we then defined a set of detectors that detect the corresponding change from visual perception of the physical environment. We further incorporated physical causality modeling and state detection in grounded language understanding.

These sentence \"corruptions\" serve as unit tests for precisely measuring the strengths and weaknesses of a given metric.

We propose a semi-supervised approach for training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the target language, but also of the source language.

    "abstract": "We present a discriminative model for single-document summarization that integrally combines compression and anaphoricity constraints. Our model selects textual units to include in the summary based on a rich set of sparse features whose weights are learned on a large corpus. We allow for the deletion of content within a sentence when that deletion is licensed by compression rules; in our framework, these are implemented as dependencies between subsentential units of text. Anaphoricity constraints then improve cross-sentence coherence by guaranteeing that, for each pronoun included in the summary, the pronoun's antecedent is included as well or the pronoun is rewritten as a full mention. When trained end-to-end, our final system outperforms prior work on both ROUGE as well as on human judgments of linguistic quality",

Recently, pruning algorithms for these models have shown to cut a large portion of the graph edges, with minimal damage to the resulting parse trees. Solving the inference problem in run time complexity determined solely by the number of edges (m) is hence of obvious importance.   We propose such an inference algorithm for first-order models, which encodes the problem as a minimum spanning tree (MST) problem in an undirected graph. This allows us to utilize state-of-the-art undirected MST algorithms whose run time is O(m) at expectation and with a very high probability. A directed parse tree is then inferred from the undirected MST and is subsequently improved with respect to the directed parsing model through local greedy updates, both steps running in O(n) time. In experiments with 18 languages, a variant of the first-order MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005b) that employs our algorithm performs very similarly to the original parser that runs an O(n^2) directed MST inference",

Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of all informative sentences and effectively reduce the influence of wrong labelled instances.

These so called TLINKs capture the relation between pairs of event mentions and time expressions. One problem is that the number of possible TLINKs grows quadratic with the number of event mentions, therefore most annotation studies concentrate on links for mentions in the same or in adjacent sentences. However, as our annotation study shows, this restriction results for 58% of the event mentions in a less precise information when the event took place. This paper proposes a new annotation scheme to anchor events in time. Not only is the annotation effort much lower as it scales linear with the number of events, it also gives a more precise anchoring when the events have happened as the complete document can be taken into account. Using this scheme, we annotated a subset of the TimeBank Corpus and compare our results to other annotation schemes. Additionally, we present some baseline experiments to automatically anchor events in time. Our annotation scheme, the automated system and the annotated corpus are publicly available.1",

In particular, the machine translation method learns from parallel data without requiring further linguistic input and is better at correcting complex mistakes. The classification approach possesses other desirable characteristics, such as the ability to easily generalize beyond what was seen in training, the ability to train without human-annotated data, and the flexibility to adjust knowledge sources for individual error types. Based on this analysis, we develop an algorithmic approach that combines the strengths of both methods.

    "abstract": "The canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions has attracted considerable attention among linguists and has been a topic of many studies. However, most of these studies require either manual analyses or measurements of human characteristics such as brain activities or reading times for each example. Thus, while these analyses are reliable for the examples they focus on, they cannot be generalized to other examples. On the other hand, the trend of actual usage can be collected automatically from a large corpus. Thus, in this paper, we assume that there is a relationship between the canonical word order and the proportion of each word order in a large corpus and present a corpusbased analysis of canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions",

In this paper, we introduce LIEL, a Language Independent Entity Linking system, which provides an EL framework which, once trained on one language, works remarkably well on a number of different languages without change. LIEL makes a joint global prediction over the entire document, employing a discriminative reranking framework with many domain and language-independent feature functions. Experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, show that the proposed system, once trained on one language, English, outperforms several state-of-the-art systems in English (by 4 points) and the trained model also works very well on Spanish (14 points better than a competitor system), demonstrating the viability of the approach",

    "abstract": "Anaphor resolution is an important task in NLP with many applications. Despite much research effort, it remains an open problem. The difficulty of the problem varies substantially across different sub-problems. One sub-problem, in particular, has been largely untouched by prior work despite occurring frequently throughout corpora: the anaphor that has multiple antecedents, which here we call multi-antecedent anaphors or manaphors. Current coreference resolvers restrict anaphors to at most a single antecedent. As we show in this paper, relaxing this constraint poses serious problems in coreference chain-building, where each chain is intended to refer to a single entity. This work provides a formalization of the new task with preliminary insights into multi-antecedent noun-phrase anaphors, and offers a method for resolving such cases that outperforms a number of baseline methods by a significant margin. Our system uses local agglomerative clustering on candidate antecedents and an existing coreference system to score clusters to determine which cluster of mentions is antecedent for a given anaphor. When we augment an existing coreference system with our proposed method, we observe a substantial increase in performance (0.6 absolute CoNLL F1) on an annotated",

Automatic couplet generation by computer is viewed as a difficult problem and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we formulate the task as a natural language generation problem using neural network structures. Given the issued antecedent clause, the system generates the subsequent clause via sequential language modeling. To satisfy special characteristics of couplets, we incorporate the attention mechanism and polishing schema into the encoding-decoding process. The couplet is generated incrementally and iteratively.

The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance.

Two lines of research have recently challenged this assumption, but they produce differing characterizations of non-arbitrariness in language. Behavioral and corpus studies have confirmed the validity of localized form-meaning patterns manifested in limited subsets of the lexicon. Meanwhile, global (lexicon-wide) statistical analyses instead find diffuse form-meaning systematicity across the lexicon as a whole. We bridge the gap with an approach that can detect both local and global formmeaning systematicity in language. In the kernel regression formulation we introduce, form-meaning relationships can be used to predict words' distributional semantic vectors from their forms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric learning algorithm that can learn weighted edit distances that minimize kernel regression error. Our results suggest that the English lexicon exhibits far more global form-meaning systematicity than previously discovered, and that much of this systematicity is focused in localized formmeaning patterns",

In this study, we use cooccurrence statistics and machine learning to demonstrate that the functions of morphological cases experience a slow, irreversible drift along history, even in a language as conservative as is Icelandic. Crucially, we then move on to demonstrate ‐using the notion of Granger-causality‐ that there are explicit causal connections between the changes in the functions of the different cases, which are consistent with documented processes in the history of Icelandic.

In practice neither of these apply for most real world applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder.

    "title": "Scalable Semi-Supervised Query Classification Using Matrix Sketching",
    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "The enormous scale of unlabeled text available today necessitates scalable schemes for representation learning in natural language processing. For instance, in this paper we are interested in classifying the intent of a user query. While our labeled data is quite limited, we have access to virtually an unlimited amount of unlabeled queries, which could be used to induce useful representations: for instance by principal component analysis (PCA). However, it is prohibitive to even store the data in memory due to its sheer size, let alone apply conventional batch algorithms. In this work, we apply the recently proposed matrix sketching algorithm to entirely obviate the problem with scalability (Liberty, 2013). This algorithm approximates the data within a specified memory bound while preserving the covariance structure necessary for PCA. Using matrix sketching, we significantly improve the user intent classification accuracy by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled queries",

In this work, we consider embeddings for social media users and demonstrate that these can be used to identify users who behave similarly or to predict attributes of users. In order to capture information from all aspects of a user's online life, we take a multiview approach, applying a weighted variant of Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (GCCA) to a collection of over 100,000 Twitter users. We demonstrate the utility of these multiview embeddings on three downstream tasks: user engagement, friend selection, and demographic attribute prediction",

This model achieves state-of-the-art results among greedy dependency parsers for English.

We apply our two models to corpora across three different languages. We find that semantic change is linear in two senses. Firstly, today's embedding vectors (= meaning) of words can be derived as linear combinations of embedding vectors of their neighbors in previous time periods. Secondly, self-similarity of words decays linearly in time. We consider both findings as new laws/hypotheses of semantic change",

Applying this initialization to the TransE model results in significant new state-of-the-art performances on the WordNet dataset, decreasing the mean rank from the previous best of 212 to 51. It also results in faster convergence of the entity representations. We find that there is a trade-off between improving the mean rank and the hits@10 with this approach.

For each sentence or batch, we only predict the target words in its sentence-level or batch-level vocabulary. Thus, we reduce both the computing time and the memory usage. Our method simply takes into account the translation options of each word or phrase in the source sentence, and picks a very small target vocabulary for each sentence based on a word-to-word translation model or a bilingual phrase library learned from a traditional machine translation model.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "We present an open web platform for developing, compiling, and running rulebased speech to sign language translation applications. Speech recognition is performed using the Nuance Recognizer 10.2 toolkit, and signed output, including both manual and non-manual components, is rendered using the JASigning avatar system. The platform is designed to make the component technologies readily accessible to sign language experts who are not necessarily computer scientists. Translation grammars are written in a version of Synchronous Context-Free Grammar adapted to the peculiarities of sign language. All processing is carried out on a remote server, with content uploaded and accessed through a web interface. Initial experiences show that simple translation grammars can be implemented on a time-scale of a few hours to a few days and produce signed output readily comprehensible to Deaf informants. Overall, the platform drastically lowers the barrier to entry for researchers interested in building applications that generate high-quality signed language",

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "In word alignment certain source words are only needed for fluency reasons and do not have a translation on the target side. Most word alignment models assume a target NULL word from which they generate these untranslatable source words. Hypothesising a target NULL word is not without problems, however. For example, because this NULL word has a position, it interferes with the distribution over alignment jumps. We present a word alignment model that accounts for untranslatable source words by generating them from preceding source words. It thereby removes the need for a target NULL word and only models alignments between word pairs that are actually observed in the data. Translation experiments on English paired with Czech, German, French and Japanese show that the model outperforms its traditional IBM counterparts in terms of BLEU score",

We show that better lexicons can be learned by using them to predict the tweet sentiment labels.

Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods proposed in previous studies",

Temporal stylistic patterns not only provide novel psychological insight into user behavior, but are useful for future research and applications in social media",

We analyze the online activity of a set of Twitter users in order to determine how well machine learning algorithms can detect a person's outlook on life by reading their tweets. A sample of tweets from each user is manually annotated in order to establish ground truth labels, and classifiers are trained to distinguish between optimistic and pessimistic users.

However, fake positive reviews can boost a business, and so a small industry producing fake reviews has developed. The two sides are facing an arms race that involves more and more natural language processing (NLP). So far, NLP has been used mostly for detection, and works well on human-generated reviews. But what happens if NLP techniques are used to generate fake reviews as well? We investigate the question in an adversarial setup, by assessing the detectability of different fake-review generation strategies. We use generative models to produce reviews based on meta-information, and evaluate their effectiveness against deceptiondetection models and human judges. We find that meta-information helps detection, but that NLP-generated reviews conditioned on such information are also much harder to detect than conventional ones",

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Uncovering thematic structures of SNS and blog posts is a crucial yet challenging task, because of the severe data sparsity induced by the short length of texts and diverse use of vocabulary. This hinders effective topic inference of traditional LDA because it infers topics based on document-level co-occurrence of words. To robustly infer topics in such contexts, we propose a latent concept topic model (LCTM). Unlike LDA, LCTM reveals topics via co-occurrence of latent concepts, which we introduce as latent variables to capture conceptual similarity of words. More specifically, LCTM models each topic as a distribution over the latent concepts, where each latent concept is a localized Gaussian distribution over the word embedding space. Since the number of unique concepts in a corpus is often much smaller than the number of unique words, LCTM is less susceptible to the data sparsity. Experiments on the 20Newsgroups show the effectiveness of LCTM in dealing with short texts as well as the capability of the model in handling held-out documents with a high degree of OOV words",

Our results suggest that the universal DEPS (UDEPS) are useful for detecting functional similarity (e.g., verb similarity, solving syntactic analogies) among languages, but their advantage over BOW is not as prominent as previously reported on English.

Thus, it is interesting to explore if for the sake of synthesis there may be other ways to generate claims.

This paper presents a pilot approach for partial cognate detection in which networks are used to represent similarities between word parts and cognate morphemes are identified with help of state-of-theart algorithms for network partitioning.

    "volume": "student",
    "abstract": "Adverse drug events (ADEs) are medical complications co-occurring with a period of drug usage. Identification of ADEs is a primary way of evaluating available quality of care. As more social media users begin discussing their drug experiences online, public data becomes available for researchers to expand existing electronic ADE reporting systems, though non-standard language inhibits ease of analysis. In this study, portions of a new corpus of approximately 160,000 tweets were used to create a lexicon-driven ADE detection system using semi-supervised, pattern-based bootstrapping. This method was able to identify misspellings, slang terms, and other non-standard language features of social media data to drive a competitive ADE detection system",

Our study aims to generate natural language descriptions for human brain activation phenomena caused by visual stimulus by employing deep learning methods, which have gained interest as an effective approach to automatically describe natural language expressions for various type of multi-modal information, such as images. We employed an image-captioning system based on a deep learning framework as the basis for our method by learning the relationship between the brain activity data and the features of an intermediate expression of the deep neural network owing to lack of training brain data. We conducted three experiments and were able to generate natural language sentences which enabled us to quantitatively interpret brain activity",

    "volume": "student",
    "abstract": "Works on Twitter community detection have yielded new ways to extract valuable insights from social media. Through this technique, Twitter users can be grouped into different types of communities such as those who have the same interests, those who interact a lot, or those who have similar sentiments about certain topics. Computationally, information is represented as a graph, and community detection is the problem of partitioning the graph such that each community is more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. It has been shown that incorporating sentiment analysis can improve community detection when looking for sentiment-based communities. However, such works only perform sentiment analysis in isolation without considering the tweet's various contextual information. Examples of these contextual information are social network structure, and conversational, author, and topic contexts. Disregarding these information poses a problem because at times, context is needed to clearly infer the sentiment of a tweet. Thus, this research aims to improve detection of sentiment-based communities on Twitter by performing contextual sentiment analysis",

    "volume": "student",
    "abstract": "This paper evaluates the challenges involved in shallow parsing of Dravidian languages which are highly agglutinative and morphologically rich. Text processing tasks in these languages are not trivial because multiple words concatenate to form a single string with morpho-phonemic changes at the point of concatenation. This phenomenon known as Sandhi, in turn complicates the individual word identification. Shallow parsing is the task of identification of correlated group of words given a raw sentence. The current work is an attempt to study the effect of Sandhi in building shallow parsers for Dravidian languages by evaluating its effect on Malayalam, one of the main languages from Dravidian family. We provide an in-depth analysis of effect ofSandhi in developing a robust shallow parser pipeline with experimental results emphasizing on how sensitive the individual components of shallow parser are, towards the accuracy of a sandhi splitter. Our work can serve as a guiding light for building robust text processing systems in Dravidian languages",

We evaluate whether we can combine comments to form larger documents to improve the quality of clusters.

Then we formulate a parsing strategy as a two-stage process where (i) coordinated and subordinated clauses of the sentence are parsed separately with respect to the sentence clause chart and (ii) their dependency trees become subtrees of the final tree of the sentence. The object language is Czech and the parser used is a maximum spanning tree parser trained on the Prague Dependency Treebank.

The majority of prior research has modeled sarcasm detection as classification, with two important limitations: 1. Balanced datasets, when sarcasm is actually rather rare. 2. Using Twitter users' self-declarations in the form of hashtags to label data, when sarcasm can take many forms. To address these issues, we create an unbalanced corpus of manually annotated Twitter conversations. We compare human and machine ability to recognize sarcasm on this data under varying amounts of context. Our results indicate that both class imbalance and labelling method affect performance, and should both be considered when designing automatic sarcasm detection systems. We conclude that for progress to be made in real-world sarcasm detection, we will require a new class labelling scheme that is able to access the 'common ground' held between conversational parties",

    "volume": "demo",
    "abstract": "META is developed to unite machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing in one easy-to-use toolkit. Its focus on indexing allows it to perform well on large datasets, supporting online classification and other out-of-core algorithms. META's liberal open source license encourages contributions, and its extensive online documentation, forum, and tutorials make this process straightforward. We run experiments and show META's performance is competitive with or better than existing software. 1 A Unified Framework As NLP techniques become more and more mature, we have great opportunities to use them to develop and support many applications, such as search engines, classifiers, and integrative applications that involve multiple components. It's possible to develop each application from scratch, but it's much more efficient to have a general toolkit that supports multiple application types. Existing tools tend to specialize on one particular area, and as such there is a wide variety of tools one must sample when performing different data science tasks. For text-mining tasks, this is even more apparent; it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to find tools that support both traditional information retrieval tasks (like tokenization, indexing, and search) alongside traditional machine learning tasks (like document classification, regression, and topic modeling). Table 1 compares META's many features across various dimensions. Note that only META satisfies all the areas while other toolkits focus on a particular area. In the case where the desired functionality is scattered, data science students, researchers, and practitioners must find the appropriate software packages for their needs and compile and configure each appropriate tool. Then, there is the problem of data formatting—it is unlikely that the tools all have standardized upon a single input format, so a certain amount of \"data munging\" is required. All of this detracts from the actual task at hand, which has a marked impact on productivity. The goal of the META project is to address these issues. In particular, we provide a unifying framework for existing machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, allowing researchers to quickly run controlled experiments. We have modularized the feature generation, instance representation, data storage formats, and algorithm implementations; this allows users to make seamless transitions along any of these dimensions with minimal effort. Finally, META is dual-licensed under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source Licence and the MIT License to reach the broadest audience possible. Due to space constraints, in this paper, we only delve into META's natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and machine learning (ML) components in section 3. However, we briefly outline all of its components here: Feature generation. META has a collection of tokenizers, filters, and analyzers that convert raw text into a feature representation. Basic features are n-gram words, but other analyzers make use of different parts of the toolkit, such as POS tag ngrams and parse tree features. An arbitrary number of feature representations may be combined; for example, a document could be represented as unigram words, bigram POS tags, and parse tree rewrite rules. Users can easily add their own feature types as well, such as sentence length distribution in a document. Search. The META search engine can store",

    "title": "NLP Approaches to Computational Argumentation",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Argumentation and debating represent primary intellectual activities of the human mind. People in all societies argue and debate, not only to convince others of their own opinions but also in order to explore the differences between multiple perspectives and conceptualizations, and to learn from this exploration. The process of reaching a resolution on controversial topics typically does not follow a simple sequence of purely logical steps. Rather it involves a wide variety of complex and interwoven actions. Presumably, pros and cons are identified, considered, and weighed, via cognitive processes that often involve persuasion and emotions, which are inherently harder to formalize from a computational perspective.This wide range of conceptual capabilities and activities, have only in part been studied in fields like CL and NLP, and typically within relatively small sub-communities that overlap the ACL audience. The new field of Computational Argumentation has very recently seen significant expansion within the CL and NLP community as new techniques and datasets start to become available, allowing for the first time investigation of the computational aspects of human argumentation in a holistic manner.The main goal of this tutorial would be to introduce this rapidly evolving field to the CL community. Specifically, we will aim to review recent advances in the field and to outline the challenging research questions - that are most relevant to the ACL audience - that naturally arise when trying to model human argumentation.We will further emphasize the practical value of this line of study, by considering real-world CL and NLP applications that are expected to emerge from this research, and to impact various industries, including legal, finance, healthcare, media, and education, to name just a few examples.The first part of the tutorial will provide introduction to the basics of argumentation and rhetoric. Next, we will cover fundamental analysis tasks in Computational Argumentation, including argumentation mining, revealing argument relations, assessing arguments quality, stance classification, polarity analysis, and more. After the coffee break, we will first review existing resources and recently introduced benchmark data. In the following part we will cover basic synthesis tasks in Computational Argumentation, including the relation to NLG and dialogue systems, and the evolving area of Debate Technologies, defined as technologies developed directly to enhance, support, and engage with human debating. Finally, we will present relevant demos, review potential applications, and discuss the future of this emerging field",

    "title": "Semantic Representations of Word Senses and Concepts",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Representing the semantics of linguistic items in a machine ­interpretable form has been a major goal of Natural Language Processing since its earliest days. Among the range of different linguistic items, words have attracted the most research attention. However, word representations have an important limitation: they conflate different meanings of a word into a single vector. Representations of word senses have the potential to overcome this inherent limitation. Indeed, the representation of individual word senses and concepts has recently gained in popularity with several experimental results showing that a considerable performance improvement can be achieved across different NLP applications upon moving from word level to the deeper sense and concept levels. Another interesting point regarding the representation of concepts and word senses is that these models can be seamlessly applied to other linguistic items, such as words, phrases, sentences, etc.This tutorial will first provide a brief overview of the recent literature concerning word representation (both count based and neural network based). It will then describe the advantages of moving from the word level to the deeper level of word senses and concepts, providing an extensive review of state ­of ­the ­art systems. Approaches covered will not only include those which draw upon knowledge resources such as WordNet, Wikipedia, BabelNet or FreeBase as reference, but also the so ­called multi ­prototype approaches which learn sense distinctions by using different clustering techniques. Our tutorial will discuss the advantages and potential limitations of all approaches, showing their most successful applications to date. We will conclude by presenting current open problems and lines of future work",

    "title": "Neural Machine Translation",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a simple new architecture for getting machines to learn to translate. Despite being relatively new (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), NMT has already shown promising results, achieving state-of-the-art performances for various language pairs (Luong et al, 2015a; Jean et al, 2015; Luong et al, 2015b; Sennrich et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016). While many of these NMT papers were presented to the ACL community, research and practice of NMT are only at their beginning stage. This tutorial would be a great opportunity for the whole community of machine translation and natural language processing to learn more about a very promising new approach to MT. This tutorial has four parts.In the first part, we start with an overview of MT approaches, including: (a) traditional methods that have been dominant over the past twenty years and (b) recent hybrid models with the use of neural network components. From these, we motivate why an end-to-end approach like neural machine translation is needed. The second part introduces a basic instance of NMT. We start out with a discussion of recurrent neural networks, including the back-propagation-through-time algorithm and stochastic gradient descent optimizers, as these are the foundation on which NMT builds. We then describe in detail the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture of NMT (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), the maximum likelihood training approach, and a simple beam-search decoder to produce translations.The third part of our tutorial describes techniques to build state-of-the-art NMT. We start with approaches to extend the vocabulary coverage of NMT (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015; Chitnis and DeNero, 2015). We then introduce the idea of jointly learning both translations and alignments through an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015); other variants of attention (Luong et al., 2015b; Tu et al., 2016) are discussed too. We describe a recent trend in NMT, that is to translate at the sub-word level (Chung et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016), so that language variations can be effectively handled. We then give tips on training and testing NMT systems such as batching and ensembling. In the final part of the tutorial, we briefly describe promising approaches, such as (a) how to combine multiple tasks to help translation (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2016; Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016) and (b) how to utilize monolingual corpora (Sennrich et al., 2016). Lastly, we conclude with challenges remained to be solved for future NMT.PS: we would also like to acknowledge the very first paper by Forcada and Ñeco (1997) on sequence-to-sequence models for translation!",

    "title": "Game Theory and Natural Language: Origin, Evolution and Processing",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "The development of game theory in the early 1940's by John von Neumann was a reaction against the then dominant view that problems in economic theory can be formulated using standard methods from optimization theory. Indeed, most real-world economic problems involve conflicting interactions among decision-making agents that cannot be adequately captured by a single (global) objective function. The main idea behind game theory is to shift the emphasis from optimality criteria to equilibrium conditions. Game theory provides a framework to model complex scenarios, with applications in economics and social science but also in different fields of information technology. With the recent development of algorithmic game theory, it has been used to solve problems in computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning and natural language processing.Game-theoretic frameworks have been used in different ways to study language origin and evolution. Furthermore, the so-called game metaphor has been used by philosophers and linguists to explain how language evolved and how it works. Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, famously introduced the concept of a language game to explain the conventional nature of language, and put forward the idea of the spontaneous formation of a common language that gradually emerges from the interactions among the speakers within a population.This concept opens the way to the interpretation of language as a complex adaptive system composed of linguistic units and their interactions, which gives rise to the emergence of structural properties. It is the core part of many computational models of language that are based on classical game theory and evolutionary game theory. With the former it is possible to model how speakers form a signaling system in which the ambiguity of the symbols is minimized; with the latter it is possible to model how speakers coordinate their linguistic choices according to the satisfaction that they have about the outcome of a communication act, converging to a common language. In the same vein, many other attempts have been proposed to explain how other characteristics of language follow similar dynamics.Game theory, and in particular evolutionary game theory, thanks to their ability to model interactive situations and to integrate information from multiple sources, have also been used to solve specific problems in natural language processing and information retrieval, such as language generation, word sense disambiguation and document and text clustering.The goal of this tutorial is to offer an introduction to the basic concepts of game theory and to show its main applications in the study of language, from different perspectives. We shall assume no pre-existing knowledge of game theory by the audience, thereby making the tutorial self-contained and understandable by a non-expert",

    "title": "Understanding Short Texts",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Billions of short texts are produced every day, in the form of search queries, ad keywords, tags, tweets, messenger conversations, social network posts, etc. Unlike documents, short texts have some unique characteristics which make them difficult to handle. First, short texts, especially search queries, do not always observe the syntax of a written language. This means traditional NLP techniques, such as syntactic parsing, do not always apply to short texts. Second, short texts contain limited context. The majority of search queries contain less than 5 words, and tweets can have no more than 140 characters. Because of the above reasons, short texts give rise to a significant amount of ambiguity, which makes them extremely difficult to handle. On the other hand, many applications, including search engines, ads, automatic question answering, online advertising, recommendation systems, etc., rely on short text understanding. In all these applications, the necessary first step is to transform an input text into a machine-interpretable representation, namely to \"understand\" the short text. A growing number of approaches leverage external knowledge to address the issue of inadequate contextual information that accompanies the short texts. These approaches can be classified into two categories: Explicit Representation Model (ERM) and Implicit Representation Model (IRM). In this tutorial, we will present a comprehensive overview of short text understanding based on explicit semantics (knowledge graph representation, acquisition, and reasoning) and implicit semantics (embedding and deep learning). Specifically, we will go over various techniques in knowledge acquisition, representation, and inferencing has been proposed for text understanding, and we will describe massive structured and semi-structured data that have been made available in the recent decade that directly or indirectly encode human knowledge, turning the knowledge representation problems into a computational grand challenge with feasible solutions insight",

    "title": "MetaNet: Repository, Identification System, and Applications",

    "abstract": "The ubiquity of metaphor in language (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) has served as impetus for cognitive linguistic approaches to the study of language, mind, and the study of mind (e.g. Thibodeau & Boroditsky 2011). While native speakers use metaphor naturally and easily, the treatment and interpretation of metaphor in computational systems remains challenging because such systems have not succeeded in developing ways to recognize the semantic elements that define metaphor. This tutorial demonstrates MetaNet's frame-based semantic analyses, and their informing of MetaNet's automatic metaphor identification system. Participants will gain a complete understanding of the theoretical basis and the practical workings of MetaNet, and acquire relevant information about the Frame Semantics basis of that knowledge base and the way that FrameNet handles the widespread phenomenon of metaphor in language. The tutorial is geared to researchers and practitioners of language technology, not necessarily experts in metaphor analysis or knowledgeable about either FrameNet or MetaNet, but who are interested in natural language processing tasks that involve automatic metaphor processing, or could benefit from exposure to tools and resources that support frame-based deep semantic, analyses of language, including metaphor as a widespread phenomenon in human language",

    "title": "Multimodal Learning and Reasoning",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing has broadened in scope to tackle more and more challenging language understanding and reasoning tasks. The core NLP tasks remain predominantly unimodal, focusing on linguistic input, despite the fact that we, humans, acquire and use language while communicating in perceptually rich environments. Moving towards human-level AI will require the integration and modeling of multiple modalities beyond language. With this tutorial, our aim is to introduce researchers to the areas of NLP that have dealt with multimodal signals. The key advantage of using multimodal signals in NLP tasks is the complementarity of the data in different modalities. For example, we are less likely to nd descriptions of yellow bananas or wooden chairs in text corpora, but these visual attributes can be readily extracted directly from images. Multimodal signals, such as visual, auditory or olfactory data, have proven useful for models of word similarity and relatedness, automatic image and video description, and even predicting the associated smells of words. Finally, multimodality offers a practical opportunity to study and apply multitask learning, a general machine learning paradigm that improves generalization performance of a task by using training signals of other related tasks.All material associated to the tutorial will be available at http://multimodalnlp.github.io/",
