    "title": "Temporal Anchoring of Events for the TimeBank Corpus",
    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Today's extraction of temporal information for events heavily depends on annotated temporal links. These so called TLINKs capture the relation between pairs of event mentions and time expressions. One problem is that the number of possible TLINKs grows quadratic with the number of event mentions, therefore most annotation studies concentrate on links for mentions in the same or in adjacent sentences. However, as our annotation study shows, this restriction results for 58% of the event mentions in a less precise information when the event took place. This paper proposes a new annotation scheme to anchor events in time. Not only is the annotation effort much lower as it scales linear with the number of events, it also gives a more precise anchoring when the events have happened as the complete document can be taken into account. Using this scheme, we annotated a subset of the TimeBank Corpus and compare our results to other annotation schemes. Additionally, we present some baseline experiments to automatically anchor events in time. Our annotation scheme, the automated system and the annotated corpus are publicly available.1",

Based on the comparative study of the two learning frameworks and through error analysis of the output of the state-of-the-art systems, we identify key strengths and weaknesses of each of these approaches and demonstrate their complementarity. In particular, the machine translation method learns from parallel data without requiring further linguistic input and is better at correcting complex mistakes. The classification approach possesses other desirable characteristics, such as the ability to easily generalize beyond what was seen in training, the ability to train without human-annotated data, and the flexibility to adjust knowledge sources for individual error types. Based on this analysis, we develop an algorithmic approach that combines the strengths of both methods. We present several systems based on resources used in previous work with a relative improvement of over 20% (and 7.4 F score points) over the previous state-of-the-art",

Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering. Further the proposed models obtained improved performance on the classification task of disease names",

On the other hand, the trend of actual usage can be collected automatically from a large corpus. Thus, in this paper, we assume that there is a relationship between the canonical word order and the proportion of each word order in a large corpus and present a corpusbased analysis of canonical word order of Japanese double object constructions",

In this paper, we introduce LIEL, a Language Independent Entity Linking system, which provides an EL framework which, once trained on one language, works remarkably well on a number of different languages without change. LIEL makes a joint global prediction over the entire document, employing a discriminative reranking framework with many domain and language-independent feature functions. Experiments on numerous benchmark datasets, show that the proposed system, once trained on one language, English, outperforms several state-of-the-art systems in English (by 4 points) and the trained model also works very well on Spanish (14 points better than a competitor system), demonstrating the viability of the approach",

    "volume": "long",
    "abstract": "Anaphor resolution is an important task in NLP with many applications. Despite much research effort, it remains an open problem. The difficulty of the problem varies substantially across different sub-problems. One sub-problem, in particular, has been largely untouched by prior work despite occurring frequently throughout corpora: the anaphor that has multiple antecedents, which here we call multi-antecedent anaphors or manaphors. Current coreference resolvers restrict anaphors to at most a single antecedent. As we show in this paper, relaxing this constraint poses serious problems in coreference chain-building, where each chain is intended to refer to a single entity. This work provides a formalization of the new task with preliminary insights into multi-antecedent noun-phrase anaphors, and offers a method for resolving such cases that outperforms a number of baseline methods by a significant margin. Our system uses local agglomerative clustering on candidate antecedents and an existing coreference system to score clusters to determine which cluster of mentions is antecedent for a given anaphor. When we augment an existing coreference system with our proposed method, we observe a substantial increase in performance (0.6 absolute CoNLL F1) on an annotated",

    "abstract": "Labeling topics learned by topic models is a challenging problem. Previous studies have used words, phrases and images to label topics. In this paper, we propose to use text summaries for topic labeling. Several sentences are extracted from the most related documents to form the summary for each topic. In order to obtain summaries with both high relevance, coverage and discrimination for all the topics, we propose an algorithm based on submodular optimization. Both automatic and manual analysis have been conducted on two real document collections, and we find 1) the summaries extracted by our proposed algorithm are superior over the summaries extracted by existing popular summarization methods; 2) the use of summaries as labels has obvious advantages over the use of words and phrases",

This paper proposes a novel generative model (TransG) to address the issue of multiple relation semantics that a relation may have multiple meanings revealed by the entity pairs associated with the corresponding triples. The new model can discover latent semantics for a relation and leverage a mixture of relationspecific component vectors to embed a fact triple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative model for knowledge graph embedding, and at the first time, the issue of multiple relation semantics is formally discussed.

Automatic couplet generation by computer is viewed as a difficult problem and has not been fully explored. In this paper, we formulate the task as a natural language generation problem using neural network structures. Given the issued antecedent clause, the system generates the subsequent clause via sequential language modeling. To satisfy special characteristics of couplets, we incorporate the attention mechanism and polishing schema into the encoding-decoding process. The couplet is generated incrementally and iteratively.

The computer initially knows nothing about language and therefore must learn it from scratch through interaction, while the human adapts to the computer's capabilities. We created a game in a blocks world and collected interactions from 100 people playing it. First, we analyze the humans' strategies, showing that using compositionality and avoiding synonyms correlates positively with task performance. Second, we compare computer strategies, showing how to quickly learn a semantic parsing model from scratch, and that modeling pragmatics further accelerates learning for successful players",

    "abstract": "Arbitrariness of the sign—the notion that the forms of words are unrelated to their meanings—is an underlying assumption of many linguistic theories. Two lines of research have recently challenged this assumption, but they produce differing characterizations of non-arbitrariness in language. Behavioral and corpus studies have confirmed the validity of localized form-meaning patterns manifested in limited subsets of the lexicon. Meanwhile, global (lexicon-wide) statistical analyses instead find diffuse form-meaning systematicity across the lexicon as a whole. We bridge the gap with an approach that can detect both local and global formmeaning systematicity in language. In the kernel regression formulation we introduce, form-meaning relationships can be used to predict words' distributional semantic vectors from their forms. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric learning algorithm that can learn weighted edit distances that minimize kernel regression error. Our results suggest that the English lexicon exhibits far more global form-meaning systematicity than previously discovered, and that much of this systematicity is focused in localized formmeaning patterns",

In this study, we use cooccurrence statistics and machine learning to demonstrate that the functions of morphological cases experience a slow, irreversible drift along history, even in a language as conservative as is Icelandic. Crucially, we then move on to demonstrate ‐using the notion of Granger-causality‐ that there are explicit causal connections between the changes in the functions of the different cases, which are consistent with documented processes in the history of Icelandic.

In practice neither of these apply for most real world applications. Here we propose an on-line learning framework whereby the dialogue policy is jointly trained alongside the reward model via active learning with a Gaussian process model. This Gaussian process operates on a continuous space dialogue representation generated in an unsupervised fashion using a recurrent neural network encoder-decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to significantly reduce data annotation costs and mitigate noisy user feedback in dialogue policy learning",

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "We consider two graph models of semantic change. The first is a time-series model that relates embedding vectors from one time period to embedding vectors of previous time periods. In the second, we construct one graph for each word: nodes in this graph correspond to time points and edge weights to the similarity of the word's meaning across two time points. We apply our two models to corpora across three different languages. We find that semantic change is linear in two senses. Firstly, today's embedding vectors (= meaning) of words can be derived as linear combinations of embedding vectors of their neighbors in previous time periods. Secondly, self-similarity of words decays linearly in time. We consider both findings as new laws/hypotheses of semantic change",

We present empirical results that show the quality of the projected models as well as their effect on the down-stream speech recognition objective.

We propose a simple approach that leverages the descriptions of entities or phrases available in lexical resources, in conjunction with distributional semantics, in order to derive a better initialization for training relational models. Applying this initialization to the TransE model results in significant new state-of-the-art performances on the WordNet dataset, decreasing the mean rank from the previous best of 212 to 51. It also results in faster convergence of the entity representations. We find that there is a trade-off between improving the mean rank and the hits@10 with this approach. This illustrates that much remains to be understood regarding performance improvements in relational models",

In this paper, we alleviate this issue by introducing a sentence-level or batch-level vocabulary, which is only a very small sub-set of the full output vocabulary. For each sentence or batch, we only predict the target words in its sentence-level or batch-level vocabulary. Thus, we reduce both the computing time and the memory usage. Our method simply takes into account the translation options of each word or phrase in the source sentence, and picks a very small target vocabulary for each sentence based on a word-to-word translation model or a bilingual phrase library learned from a traditional machine translation model. Experimental results on the large-scale English-to-French task show that our method achieves better translation performance by 1 BLEU point over the large vocabulary neural machine translation system of Jean et al.

New state-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn representations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant improvements in NER for Chinese social media.

We present a word alignment model that accounts for untranslatable source words by generating them from preceding source words. It thereby removes the need for a target NULL word and only models alignments between word pairs that are actually observed in the data.

    "abstract": "Relation classification is an important semantic processing task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). State-ofthe-art systems still rely on lexical resources such as WordNet or NLP systems like dependency parser and named entity recognizers (NER) to get high-level features. Another challenge is that important information can appear at any position in the sentence. To tackle these problems, we propose Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks(AttBLSTM) to capture the most important semantic information in a sentence. The experimental results on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task show that our method outperforms most of the existing methods, with only word vectors",

    "abstract": "We describe an efficient neural network method to automatically learn sentiment lexicons without relying on any manual resources. The method takes inspiration from the NRC method, which gives the best results in SemEval13 by leveraging emoticons in large tweets, using the PMI between words and tweet sentiments to define the sentiment attributes of words. We show that better lexicons can be learned by using them to predict the tweet sentiment labels. By using a very simple neural network, our method is fast and can take advantage of the same data volume as the NRC method. Experiments show that our lexicons give significantly better accuracies on multiple languages compared to the current best methods",

    "abstract": "Dimensional sentiment analysis aims to recognize continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions such as the valencearousal (VA) space. Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods proposed in previous studies",

But what happens if NLP techniques are used to generate fake reviews as well? We investigate the question in an adversarial setup, by assessing the detectability of different fake-review generation strategies. We use generative models to produce reviews based on meta-information, and evaluate their effectiveness against deceptiondetection models and human judges.

    "abstract": "Neural Machine Translation (MT) has reached state-of-the-art results. However, one of the main challenges that neural MT still faces is dealing with very large vocabularies and morphologically rich languages. In this paper, we propose a neural MT system using character-based embeddings in combination with convolutional and highway layers to replace the standard lookup-based word representations. The resulting unlimited-vocabulary and affix-aware source word embeddings are tested in a state-of-the-art neural MT based on an attention-based bidirectional recurrent neural network. The proposed MT scheme provides improved results even when the source language is not morphologically rich. Improvements up to 3 BLEU points are obtained in the German-English WMT task",

    "title": "A Latent Concept Topic Model for Robust Topic Inference Using Word Embeddings",
    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Uncovering thematic structures of SNS and blog posts is a crucial yet challenging task, because of the severe data sparsity induced by the short length of texts and diverse use of vocabulary. This hinders effective topic inference of traditional LDA because it infers topics based on document-level co-occurrence of words. To robustly infer topics in such contexts, we propose a latent concept topic model (LCTM). Unlike LDA, LCTM reveals topics via co-occurrence of latent concepts, which we introduce as latent variables to capture conceptual similarity of words. More specifically, LCTM models each topic as a distribution over the latent concepts, where each latent concept is a localized Gaussian distribution over the word embedding space. Since the number of unique concepts in a corpus is often much smaller than the number of unique words, LCTM is less susceptible to the data sparsity. Experiments on the 20Newsgroups show the effectiveness of LCTM in dealing with short texts as well as the capability of the model in handling held-out documents with a high degree of OOV words",

We also present a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The model obtains state-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically complex languages.

This calculus extends analogy computations like \"king−man+woman = queen\". For the tasks of Antonym Classification and POS Tagging our method outperforms the state of the art.

    "volume": "short",
    "abstract": "Recent comparative studies have demonstrated the usefulness of dependencybased contexts (DEPS) for learning distributed word representations for similarity tasks. In English, DEPS tend to perform better than the more common, less informed bag-of-words contexts (BOW). In this paper, we present the first crosslinguistic comparison of different context types for three different languages. DEPS are extracted from \"universal parses\" without any language-specific optimization. Our results suggest that the universal DEPS (UDEPS) are useful for detecting functional similarity (e.g., verb similarity, solving syntactic analogies) among languages, but their advantage over BOW is not as prominent as previously reported on English. We also show that simple \"post-parsing\" filtering of useful UDEPS contexts leads to consistent improvements across languages",

Much attention has been given to the former, but considerably less to the latter. A key component in synthesizing arguments is the synthesis of claims. One way to do so is by employing argumentation mining to detect claims within an appropriate corpus. In general, this appears to be a hard problem. Thus, it is interesting to explore if for the sake of synthesis there may be other ways to generate claims. Here we explore such a method: we extract the predicate of simple, manuallydetected, claims, and attempt to generate novel claims from them. Surprisingly, this simple method yields fairly good results",

In this paper, we investigate the greedy discriminative parser described in (Legrand and Collobert, 2015), which relies on word embeddings, in the context of MRL.

In this work, we bring these two ideas together and show that given raw text, a dictionary, and eye-tracking data obtained from naive participants reading text, we can train a weakly supervised PoS tagger using a second-order HMM with maximum entropy emissions.

Recently developed methods work well on language families with moderate time depths, but they are not capable of identifying cognate morphemes in words which are only partially related. Partial cognacy, however, is a frequently recurring phenomenon, especially in language families with productive derivational morphology. This paper presents a pilot approach for partial cognate detection in which networks are used to represent similarities between word parts and cognate morphemes are identified with help of state-of-theart algorithms for network partitioning. The approach is tested on a newly created benchmark dataset with data from three sub-branches of Sino-Tibetan and yields very promising results, outperforming all algorithms which are not sensible to partial cognacy",

It has been shown that incorporating sentiment analysis can improve community detection when looking for sentiment-based communities. However, such works only perform sentiment analysis in isolation without considering the tweet's various contextual information. Examples of these contextual information are social network structure, and conversational, author, and topic contexts. Disregarding these information poses a problem because at times, context is needed to clearly infer the sentiment of a tweet.

The current work is an attempt to study the effect of Sandhi in building shallow parsers for Dravidian languages by evaluating its effect on Malayalam, one of the main languages from Dravidian family. We provide an in-depth analysis of effect ofSandhi in developing a robust shallow parser pipeline with experimental results emphasizing on how sensitive the individual components of shallow parser are, towards the accuracy of a sandhi splitter.

Then we formulate a parsing strategy as a two-stage process where (i) coordinated and subordinated clauses of the sentence are parsed separately with respect to the sentence clause chart and (ii) their dependency trees become subtrees of the final tree of the sentence. The object language is Czech and the parser used is a maximum spanning tree parser trained on the Prague Dependency Treebank.

Although the method has been designed for the dependency parsing of Czech, it is useful for other parsing techniques and languages",

    "volume": "student",
    "abstract": "Sarcasm can radically alter or invert a phrase's meaning. Sarcasm detection can therefore help improve natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The majority of prior research has modeled sarcasm detection as classification, with two important limitations: 1. Balanced datasets, when sarcasm is actually rather rare. 2. Using Twitter users' self-declarations in the form of hashtags to label data, when sarcasm can take many forms. To address these issues, we create an unbalanced corpus of manually annotated Twitter conversations. We compare human and machine ability to recognize sarcasm on this data under varying amounts of context. Our results indicate that both class imbalance and labelling method affect performance, and should both be considered when designing automatic sarcasm detection systems. We conclude that for progress to be made in real-world sarcasm detection, we will require a new class labelling scheme that is able to access the 'common ground' held between conversational parties",

    "volume": "demo",
    "abstract": "META is developed to unite machine learning, information retrieval, and natural language processing in one easy-to-use toolkit. Its focus on indexing allows it to perform well on large datasets, supporting online classification and other out-of-core algorithms. META's liberal open source license encourages contributions, and its extensive online documentation, forum, and tutorials make this process straightforward. We run experiments and show META's performance is competitive with or better than existing software. 1 A Unified Framework As NLP techniques become more and more mature, we have great opportunities to use them to develop and support many applications, such as search engines, classifiers, and integrative applications that involve multiple components. It's possible to develop each application from scratch, but it's much more efficient to have a general toolkit that supports multiple application types. Existing tools tend to specialize on one particular area, and as such there is a wide variety of tools one must sample when performing different data science tasks. For text-mining tasks, this is even more apparent; it is extremely difficult (if not impossible) to find tools that support both traditional information retrieval tasks (like tokenization, indexing, and search) alongside traditional machine learning tasks (like document classification, regression, and topic modeling). Table 1 compares META's many features across various dimensions. Note that only META satisfies all the areas while other toolkits focus on a particular area. In the case where the desired functionality is scattered, data science students, researchers, and practitioners must find the appropriate software packages for their needs and compile and configure each appropriate tool. Then, there is the problem of data formatting—it is unlikely that the tools all have standardized upon a single input format, so a certain amount of \"data munging\" is required. All of this detracts from the actual task at hand, which has a marked impact on productivity. The goal of the META project is to address these issues. In particular, we provide a unifying framework for existing machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, allowing researchers to quickly run controlled experiments. We have modularized the feature generation, instance representation, data storage formats, and algorithm implementations; this allows users to make seamless transitions along any of these dimensions with minimal effort. Finally, META is dual-licensed under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source Licence and the MIT License to reach the broadest audience possible. Due to space constraints, in this paper, we only delve into META's natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and machine learning (ML) components in section 3. However, we briefly outline all of its components here: Feature generation. META has a collection of tokenizers, filters, and analyzers that convert raw text into a feature representation. Basic features are n-gram words, but other analyzers make use of different parts of the toolkit, such as POS tag ngrams and parse tree features. An arbitrary number of feature representations may be combined; for example, a document could be represented as unigram words, bigram POS tags, and parse tree rewrite rules. Users can easily add their own feature types as well, such as sentence length distribution in a document. Search. The META search engine can store",

    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Argumentation and debating represent primary intellectual activities of the human mind. People in all societies argue and debate, not only to convince others of their own opinions but also in order to explore the differences between multiple perspectives and conceptualizations, and to learn from this exploration. The process of reaching a resolution on controversial topics typically does not follow a simple sequence of purely logical steps. Rather it involves a wide variety of complex and interwoven actions. Presumably, pros and cons are identified, considered, and weighed, via cognitive processes that often involve persuasion and emotions, which are inherently harder to formalize from a computational perspective.This wide range of conceptual capabilities and activities, have only in part been studied in fields like CL and NLP, and typically within relatively small sub-communities that overlap the ACL audience. The new field of Computational Argumentation has very recently seen significant expansion within the CL and NLP community as new techniques and datasets start to become available, allowing for the first time investigation of the computational aspects of human argumentation in a holistic manner.The main goal of this tutorial would be to introduce this rapidly evolving field to the CL community. Specifically, we will aim to review recent advances in the field and to outline the challenging research questions - that are most relevant to the ACL audience - that naturally arise when trying to model human argumentation.We will further emphasize the practical value of this line of study, by considering real-world CL and NLP applications that are expected to emerge from this research, and to impact various industries, including legal, finance, healthcare, media, and education, to name just a few examples.The first part of the tutorial will provide introduction to the basics of argumentation and rhetoric. Next, we will cover fundamental analysis tasks in Computational Argumentation, including argumentation mining, revealing argument relations, assessing arguments quality, stance classification, polarity analysis, and more. After the coffee break, we will first review existing resources and recently introduced benchmark data. In the following part we will cover basic synthesis tasks in Computational Argumentation, including the relation to NLG and dialogue systems, and the evolving area of Debate Technologies, defined as technologies developed directly to enhance, support, and engage with human debating. Finally, we will present relevant demos, review potential applications, and discuss the future of this emerging field",

    "title": "Semantic Representations of Word Senses and Concepts",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Representing the semantics of linguistic items in a machine ­interpretable form has been a major goal of Natural Language Processing since its earliest days. Among the range of different linguistic items, words have attracted the most research attention. However, word representations have an important limitation: they conflate different meanings of a word into a single vector. Representations of word senses have the potential to overcome this inherent limitation. Indeed, the representation of individual word senses and concepts has recently gained in popularity with several experimental results showing that a considerable performance improvement can be achieved across different NLP applications upon moving from word level to the deeper sense and concept levels. Another interesting point regarding the representation of concepts and word senses is that these models can be seamlessly applied to other linguistic items, such as words, phrases, sentences, etc.This tutorial will first provide a brief overview of the recent literature concerning word representation (both count based and neural network based). It will then describe the advantages of moving from the word level to the deeper level of word senses and concepts, providing an extensive review of state ­of ­the ­art systems. Approaches covered will not only include those which draw upon knowledge resources such as WordNet, Wikipedia, BabelNet or FreeBase as reference, but also the so ­called multi ­prototype approaches which learn sense distinctions by using different clustering techniques. Our tutorial will discuss the advantages and potential limitations of all approaches, showing their most successful applications to date. We will conclude by presenting current open problems and lines of future work",

This tutorial would be a great opportunity for the whole community of machine translation and natural language processing to learn more about a very promising new approach to MT. This tutorial has four parts.In the first part, we start with an overview of MT approaches, including: (a) traditional methods that have been dominant over the past twenty years and (b) recent hybrid models with the use of neural network components. From these, we motivate why an end-to-end approach like neural machine translation is needed. The second part introduces a basic instance of NMT. We start out with a discussion of recurrent neural networks, including the back-propagation-through-time algorithm and stochastic gradient descent optimizers, as these are the foundation on which NMT builds. We then describe in detail the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture of NMT (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), the maximum likelihood training approach, and a simple beam-search decoder to produce translations.The third part of our tutorial describes techniques to build state-of-the-art NMT. We start with approaches to extend the vocabulary coverage of NMT (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015; Chitnis and DeNero, 2015). We then introduce the idea of jointly learning both translations and alignments through an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015); other variants of attention (Luong et al., 2015b; Tu et al., 2016) are discussed too. We describe a recent trend in NMT, that is to translate at the sub-word level (Chung et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016), so that language variations can be effectively handled. We then give tips on training and testing NMT systems such as batching and ensembling. In the final part of the tutorial, we briefly describe promising approaches, such as (a) how to combine multiple tasks to help translation (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2016; Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016) and (b) how to utilize monolingual corpora (Sennrich et al., 2016). Lastly, we conclude with challenges remained to be solved for future NMT.PS: we would also like to acknowledge the very first paper by Forcada and Ñeco (1997) on sequence-to-sequence models for translation!",

    "title": "Game Theory and Natural Language: Origin, Evolution and Processing",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "The development of game theory in the early 1940's by John von Neumann was a reaction against the then dominant view that problems in economic theory can be formulated using standard methods from optimization theory. Indeed, most real-world economic problems involve conflicting interactions among decision-making agents that cannot be adequately captured by a single (global) objective function. The main idea behind game theory is to shift the emphasis from optimality criteria to equilibrium conditions. Game theory provides a framework to model complex scenarios, with applications in economics and social science but also in different fields of information technology. With the recent development of algorithmic game theory, it has been used to solve problems in computer vision, pattern recognition, machine learning and natural language processing.Game-theoretic frameworks have been used in different ways to study language origin and evolution. Furthermore, the so-called game metaphor has been used by philosophers and linguists to explain how language evolved and how it works. Ludwig Wittgenstein, for example, famously introduced the concept of a language game to explain the conventional nature of language, and put forward the idea of the spontaneous formation of a common language that gradually emerges from the interactions among the speakers within a population.This concept opens the way to the interpretation of language as a complex adaptive system composed of linguistic units and their interactions, which gives rise to the emergence of structural properties. It is the core part of many computational models of language that are based on classical game theory and evolutionary game theory. With the former it is possible to model how speakers form a signaling system in which the ambiguity of the symbols is minimized; with the latter it is possible to model how speakers coordinate their linguistic choices according to the satisfaction that they have about the outcome of a communication act, converging to a common language. In the same vein, many other attempts have been proposed to explain how other characteristics of language follow similar dynamics.Game theory, and in particular evolutionary game theory, thanks to their ability to model interactive situations and to integrate information from multiple sources, have also been used to solve specific problems in natural language processing and information retrieval, such as language generation, word sense disambiguation and document and text clustering.The goal of this tutorial is to offer an introduction to the basic concepts of game theory and to show its main applications in the study of language, from different perspectives. We shall assume no pre-existing knowledge of game theory by the audience, thereby making the tutorial self-contained and understandable by a non-expert",

    "title": "Understanding Short Texts",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Billions of short texts are produced every day, in the form of search queries, ad keywords, tags, tweets, messenger conversations, social network posts, etc. Unlike documents, short texts have some unique characteristics which make them difficult to handle. First, short texts, especially search queries, do not always observe the syntax of a written language. This means traditional NLP techniques, such as syntactic parsing, do not always apply to short texts. Second, short texts contain limited context. The majority of search queries contain less than 5 words, and tweets can have no more than 140 characters. Because of the above reasons, short texts give rise to a significant amount of ambiguity, which makes them extremely difficult to handle. On the other hand, many applications, including search engines, ads, automatic question answering, online advertising, recommendation systems, etc., rely on short text understanding. In all these applications, the necessary first step is to transform an input text into a machine-interpretable representation, namely to \"understand\" the short text. A growing number of approaches leverage external knowledge to address the issue of inadequate contextual information that accompanies the short texts. These approaches can be classified into two categories: Explicit Representation Model (ERM) and Implicit Representation Model (IRM). In this tutorial, we will present a comprehensive overview of short text understanding based on explicit semantics (knowledge graph representation, acquisition, and reasoning) and implicit semantics (embedding and deep learning). Specifically, we will go over various techniques in knowledge acquisition, representation, and inferencing has been proposed for text understanding, and we will describe massive structured and semi-structured data that have been made available in the recent decade that directly or indirectly encode human knowledge, turning the knowledge representation problems into a computational grand challenge with feasible solutions insight",

    "title": "MetaNet: Repository, Identification System, and Applications",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "The ubiquity of metaphor in language (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) has served as impetus for cognitive linguistic approaches to the study of language, mind, and the study of mind (e.g. Thibodeau & Boroditsky 2011). While native speakers use metaphor naturally and easily, the treatment and interpretation of metaphor in computational systems remains challenging because such systems have not succeeded in developing ways to recognize the semantic elements that define metaphor. This tutorial demonstrates MetaNet's frame-based semantic analyses, and their informing of MetaNet's automatic metaphor identification system. Participants will gain a complete understanding of the theoretical basis and the practical workings of MetaNet, and acquire relevant information about the Frame Semantics basis of that knowledge base and the way that FrameNet handles the widespread phenomenon of metaphor in language. The tutorial is geared to researchers and practitioners of language technology, not necessarily experts in metaphor analysis or knowledgeable about either FrameNet or MetaNet, but who are interested in natural language processing tasks that involve automatic metaphor processing, or could benefit from exposure to tools and resources that support frame-based deep semantic, analyses of language, including metaphor as a widespread phenomenon in human language",

    "title": "Multimodal Learning and Reasoning",
    "volume": "tutorial",
    "abstract": "Natural Language Processing has broadened in scope to tackle more and more challenging language understanding and reasoning tasks. The core NLP tasks remain predominantly unimodal, focusing on linguistic input, despite the fact that we, humans, acquire and use language while communicating in perceptually rich environments. Moving towards human-level AI will require the integration and modeling of multiple modalities beyond language. With this tutorial, our aim is to introduce researchers to the areas of NLP that have dealt with multimodal signals. The key advantage of using multimodal signals in NLP tasks is the complementarity of the data in different modalities. For example, we are less likely to nd descriptions of yellow bananas or wooden chairs in text corpora, but these visual attributes can be readily extracted directly from images. Multimodal signals, such as visual, auditory or olfactory data, have proven useful for models of word similarity and relatedness, automatic image and video description, and even predicting the associated smells of words. Finally, multimodality offers a practical opportunity to study and apply multitask learning, a general machine learning paradigm that improves generalization performance of a task by using training signals of other related tasks.All material associated to the tutorial will be available at http://multimodalnlp.github.io/",
