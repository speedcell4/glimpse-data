    "abstract": "Sampling subgraphs for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is receiving much attention from the GNN community. While a variety of methods have been proposed, each method samples the graph according to its own heuristic. However, there has been little work in mixing these heuristics in an end-to-end trainable manner. In this work, we design a generative framework for graph sampling. Our method, SubMix, parameterizes subgraph sampling as a convex combination of heuristics. We show that a continuous relaxation of the discrete sampling process allows us to efficiently obtain analytical gradients for training the sampling parameters. Our experimental results illustrate the usefulness of learning graph sampling in three scenarios: (1) robust training of GNNs by automatically learning to discard noisy edge sources; (2) improving model performance by trainable and online edge subset selection; and (3) by integrating our framework into decoupled GNN models improves their performance on standard benchmarks",

    "title": "Guided Deep Kernel Learning",
    "abstract": "Combining Gaussian processes with the expressive power of deep neural networks is commonly done nowadays through deep kernel learning (DKL). Unfortunately, due to the kernel optimization process, this often results in losing their Bayesian benefits. In this study, we present a novel approach for learning deep kernels by utilizing infinite-width neural networks. We propose to use the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) model as a guide to the DKL model in the optimization process. Our approach harnesses the reliable uncertainty estimation of the NNGPs to adapt the DKL target confidence when it encounters novel data points. As a result, we get the best of both worlds, we leverage the Bayesian behavior of the NNGP, namely its robustness to overfitting, and accurate uncertainty estimation, while maintaining the generalization abilities, scalability, and flexibility of deep kernels. Empirically, we show on multiple benchmark datasets of varying sizes and dimensionality, that our method is robust to overfitting, has good predictive performance, and provides reliable uncertainty estimations",

    "title": "Bounding the optimal value function in compositional reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "In the field of reinforcement learning (RL), agents are often tasked with solving a variety of problems differing only in their reward functions. In order to quickly obtain solutions to unseen problems with new reward functions, a popular approach involves functional composition of previously solved tasks. However, previous work using such functional composition has primarily focused on specific instances of composition functions, whose limiting assumptions allow for exact zero-shot composition. Our work unifies these examples and provides a more general framework for compositionality in both standard and entropy-regularized RL. We find that, for a broad class of functions, the optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related to the known primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the primitive tasks. We also show that the regret of using a zero-shot policy can be bounded for this class of functions. The derived bounds can be used to develop clipping approaches for reducing uncertainty during training, allowing agents to quickly adapt to new tasks",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) are widely used for density estimation and dimensionality reduction, but infer latent representations via amortized inference algorithms, which require that all data dimensions are observed. VAEs thus lack a key strength of probabilistic graphical models: the ability to infer posteriors for test queries with arbitrary structure. We demonstrate that many prior methods for imputation with VAEs are costly and ineffective, and achieve superior performance via query-adaptive variational inference (QAVI) algorithms based directly on the generative decoder.  By analytically marginalizing arbitrary sets of missing features, and optimizing expressive posteriors including mixtures and density flows, our non-amortized QAVI algorithms achieve excellent performance while avoiding expensive model retraining. On standard image and tabular datasets, our approach substantially outperforms prior methods in the plausibility and diversity of imputations.  We also show that QAVI effectively generalizes to recent hierarchical VAE models for high-dimensional images",

We provide a theoretical analysis of the training and validation loss under FLASH, and their tradeoff with the training cost measured as the data wasted in training sub-optimal algorithms.

Nevertheless, we establish generalization upper bounds on the counterfactual loss and ITE error of the target task, demonstrating the feasibility of ITE knowledge transfer. Subsequently, we introduce a framework with a new Causal Inference Task Affinity (CITA) measure for ITE knowledge transfer. Specifically, we use CITA to find the closest source task to the target task and utilize it for ITE knowledge transfer.

    "abstract": "Accurate outlier detection is not only a necessary preprocessing step, but can itself give important insights into the data. However, especially, for non-linear regression the detection of outliers is non-trivial, and actually ambiguous. We propose a new method that identifies outliers by finding a subset of data points T such that the marginal likelihood of all remaining data points S is maximized. Though the idea is more general, it is particular appealing for Gaussian processes regression, where the marginal likelihood has an analytic solution. While maximizing the marginal likelihood for hyper-parameter optimization is a well established non-convex optimization problem, optimizing the set of data points S is not. Indeed, even a greedy approximation is computationally challenging due to the high cost of evaluating the marginal likelihood. As a remedy, we propose an efficient projected gradient descent method with provable convergence guarantees. Moreover, we also establish the breakdown point when jointly optimizing hyper-parameters and S. For various datasets and types of outliers, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can improve outlier detection and robustness when compared with several popular alternatives like the student-t likelihood",

    "title": "Two Sides of Miscalibration: Identifying Over and Under-Confidence Prediction for Network Calibration",
    "abstract": "Proper confidence calibration of deep neural networks is essential for reliable predictions in safety-critical tasks. Miscalibration can lead to model over-confidence and/or under-confidence; i.e., the model’s confidence in its prediction can be greater or less than the model’s accuracy. Recent studies have highlighted the over-confidence issue by introducing calibration techniques and demonstrated success on various tasks. However, miscalibration through under-confidence has not yet to receive much attention. In this paper, we address the necessity of paying attention to the under-confidence issue. We first introduce a novel metric, a miscalibration score, to identify the overall and class-wise calibration status, including being over or under-confident. Our proposed metric reveals the pitfalls of existing calibration techniques, where they often overly calibrate the model and worsen under-confident predictions. Then we utilize the class-wise miscalibration score as a proxy to design a calibration technique that can tackle both over and under-confidence. We report extensive experiments that show our proposed methods substantially outperforming existing calibration techniques. We also validate our proposed calibration technique on an automatic failure detection task with a risk-coverage curve, reporting that our methods improve failure detection as well as trustworthiness of the model.

Overwhelming empirical evidence suggests that pruned models retain very high accuracy even with a tiny fraction of parameters. However, relatively little work has gone into characterising the small pruned networks obtained, beyond a measure of their accuracy. In this paper, we use the sparse double descent approach to identify univocally and characterise pruned models associated with classification tasks. We observe empirically that, for a given task, iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) tends to converge to networks of comparable sizes even when starting from full networks with sizes ranging over orders of magnitude. We analyse the best pruned models in a controlled experimental setup and show that their number of parameters reflects task difficulty and that they are much better than full networks at capturing the true conditional probability distribution of the labels. On real data, we similarly observe that pruned models are less prone to overconfident predictions. Our results suggest that pruned models obtained via IMP not only have advantageous computational properties but also provide a better representation of uncertainty in learning",

For deterministic dynamics, the optimal policy can be derived using Bayesian inference in the control-as-inference framework; however, for stochastic dynamics, the direct use of this approach leads to risk-taking optimistic policies. To address this issue, current approaches in entropy-regularized RL involve a constrained optimization procedure which fixes system dynamics to the original dynamics, however this approach is not consistent with the unconstrained Bayesian inference framework. In this work we resolve this inconsistency by developing an exact mapping from the constrained optimization problem in entropy-regularized RL to a different optimization problem which can be solved using the unconstrained Bayesian inference approach. We show that the optimal policies are the same for both problems, thus our results lead to the exact solution for the optimal policy in entropy-regularized RL with stochastic dynamics through Bayesian inference",

Then, it combines them through a weighted majority vote, based on their quality on the entire learning set. In this paper, we propose a supervised binary classification framework that propagates the local knowledge acquired during the boosting iterations to the prediction function. Based on this general framework, we introduce SamBA, an interpretable greedy ensemble method designed for fat datasets, with a large number of dimensions and a small number of samples. SamBA learns local classifiers and combines them, using a similarity function, to optimize its efficiency in data extraction. We provide a theoretical analysis of SamBA, yielding convergence and generalization guarantees.

However, preference-based models assume that individuals: (1) give their preferences only between pairs of objects; (2) are always able to pick the best preferred object. In many situations, they may be instead choosing out of a set with more than two elements and, because of lack of information and/or incomparability (objects with contradictory characteristics), they may not be able to select a single most preferred object. To address these situations, we need a choice model which allows an individual to express a set-valued choice. Choice functions provide such a mathematical framework. We propose a Gaussian Process model to learn choice functions from choice data. The model assumes a multiple utility representation of a choice function based on the concept of Pareto rationalization, and derives a strategy to learn both the number and the values of these latent multiple utilities.

Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise sample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm selection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive. We exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated by a Compound Poisson process and arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.

The amortization network must be redesigned manually and trained again in case a different kernel is employed, which leads to a large overhead in design time and training time. We propose amortizing kernel parameter inference over a complete kernel-structure-family rather than a fixed kernel structure. We do that via defining an amortization network over pairs of datasets and kernel structures. This enables fast kernel inference for each element in the kernel family without retraining the amortization network. As a by-product, our amortization network is able to do fast ensembling over kernel structures.

When the response or selection mechanism is ignorable (i.e., independent of the response variable given the features) one can use off-the-shelf regression methods; in the nonignorable case one typically has to adjust for bias. We observe that privileged information (i.e. information that is only available during training) might render a nonignorable selection mechanism ignorable, and we refer to this scenario as Privilegedly Missing at Random (PMAR). We propose a novel imputation-based regression method, named repeated regression, that is suitable for PMAR. We also consider an importance weighted regression method, and a doubly robust combination of the two. The proposed methods are easy to implement with most popular out-of-the-box regression algorithms. We empirically assess the performance of the proposed methods with extensive simulated experiments and on a synthetically augmented real-world dataset.

However, due to cognitive limitations, abductive explanations are often too large to be interpretable. In those cases, we need to reduce the size of abductive explanations, while still determining the predicted label with high probability. In this paper, we show that finding such probabilistic explanations is NP-hard, even for decision trees. In order to circumvent this issue, we investigate the approximability of probabilistic explanations through the lens of supermodularity. We examine both greedy descent and greedy ascent approaches for supermodular minimization, whose approximation guarantees depend on the curvature of the “unnormalized” error function that evaluates the precision of the explanation.

    "title": "Learning in online MDPs: is there a price for handling the communicating case?",
    "abstract": "It is a remarkable fact that the same $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret rate can be achieved in both the Experts Problem and the Adversarial Multi-Armed Bandit problem albeit with a worse dependence on number of actions in the latter case. In contrast, it has been shown that handling online MDPs with communicating structure and bandit information incurs $\\Omega(T^{2/3})$ regret even in the case of deterministic transitions. Is this the price we pay for handling communicating structure or is it because we also have bandit feedback? In this paper we show that with full information, online MDPs can still be learned at an $O(\\sqrt{T})$ rate even in the presence of communicating structure. We first show this by proposing an efficient follow the perturbed leader (FPL) algorithm for the deterministic transition case. We then extend our scope to consider stochastic transitions where we first give an inefficient $O(\\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm (with a mild additional condition on the dynamics). Then we show how to achieve $O\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{T}{\\alpha}}\\right)$ regret rate using an oracle-efficient algorithm but with the additional restriction that the starting state distribution has mass at least $\\alpha$ on each state",

To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series of works have provided theoretical justification for over-parameterized linear regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if benign overfitting can occur in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e., examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples, on subGaussian mixture data. In detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under Lp adversarial perturbations. Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks, despite overfitting the noisy training data.

    "title": "An effective negotiating agent framework based on deep offline reinforcement learning",
    "abstract": "Learning is crucial for automated negotiation, and recent years have witnessed a remarkable achievement in application of reinforcement learning (RL) for various negotiation tasks. Conventional RL methods focus generally on learning from active interactions with opposing negotiators. However, collecting online data is expensive in many realistic negotiation scenarios. While previous studies partially mitigate this problem through the use of opponent simulators (i.e., agents following known strategies), in reality it is usually hard to fully capture an opponent’s negotiation strategy. Moreover, a further challenge lies in an agent’s capability of adapting to dynamic variations of an opponent’s preferences or strategies, which may happen from time to time for different reasons in subsequent negotiations. In response to these challenges, this article proposes a novel Deep Offline Reinforcement learning Negotiating Agent framework that allows to learn an effective strategy using previously collected negotiation datasets without requiring interaction with an opponent. This is in contrast to existing RL-based negotiation approaches that all rely on active interaction with opponents. Furthermore, the strategy fine-tuning mechanism is included to adjust the learned strategy in response to the preferences or strategy changes of the opponent. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated based on a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines under different settings. Experimental results show that the framework allows to learn effective strategies exclusively with offline datasets, and is also capable of effectively adapting to changes of an opponent’s preferences or strategy",

    "abstract": "Physical adversarial attacks can mislead detectors in real-world scenarios and have attracted increasing attention. However, most existing works manipulate the detector’s final outputs as attack targets while ignoring the inherent characteristics of objects. This can result in attacks being trapped in model-specific local optima and reduced transferability. To address this issue, we propose a Multi-layer Feature-aware Attack (MFA) that considers the importance of multi-layer features and disrupts critical object-aware features that dominate decision-making across different models. Specifically, we leverage the location and category information of detector outputs to assign attribution scores to different feature layers. Then, we weight each feature according to their attribution results and design a pixel-level loss function in the opposite optimized direction of object detection to generate adversarial camouflages. We conduct extensive experiments in both digital and physical worlds on ten outstanding detection models and demonstrate the superior performance of MFA in terms of attacking capability and transferability.

We study sequential decision-making problems formulated as cooperative Markov games with reach-avoid objectives. We apply a differential privacy mechanism to privatize agents’ communicated symbolic state trajectories, and analyze tradeoffs between the strength of privacy and the team’s performance. For a given level of privacy, this tradeoff is shown to depend critically upon the total correlation among agents’ state-action processes. We synthesize policies that are robust to privacy by reducing the value of the total correlation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the team’s performance under these policies decreases by only 6 percent when comparing private versus non-private implementations of communication. By contrast, the team’s performance decreases by 88 percent when using baseline policies that ignore total correlation and only optimize team performance",

If the outcome directly affects its own missingness status, i.e., it is “self-censoring”, this may lead to severely biased causal effect estimates. Miao et al. (2015) proposed the shadow variable method to correct for bias due to self-censoring; however, verifying the required model assumptions can be difficult. Here, we propose a test based on a randomized incentive variable offered to encourage reporting of the outcome that can be used to verify identification assumptions that are sufficient to correct for both self-censoring and confounding bias. Concretely, the test confirms whether a given set of pre-treatment covariates is sufficient to block all backdoor paths between the treatment and outcome as well as all paths between the treatment and missingness indicator after conditioning on the outcome. We show that under these conditions, the causal effect is identified by using the treatment as a shadow variable, and it leads to an intuitive inverse probability weighting estimator that uses a product of the treatment and response weights. We evaluate the efficacy of our test and downstream estimator via simulations",

    "title": "Detection of Short-Term Temporal Dependencies in Hawkes Processes with Heterogeneous Background Dynamics",
    "abstract": "Many kinds of simultaneously-observed event sequences exhibit mutually exciting or inhibiting patterns. Reliable detection of such temporal dependencies is crucial for scientific investigation. A common model is the Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP), whose impact function naturally encodes a causal structure in Granger causality. However, the vast majority of existing methods use a transformed  standard MHP intensity with a constant baseline, which may be inconsistent with real-world data. On the other hand, modeling irregular and unknown background dynamics directly is a challenge, as one struggles to distinguish the effect of mutual interaction from that of fluctuations in background dynamics. In this paper, we address the short-term temporal dependency detection issue. We show that maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for cross-impact from MHP has an error that can not be eliminated, but may be reduced by an order of magnitude using a heterogeneous intensity not for the target HP but for the interacting HP. Then we propose a robust and computationally-efficient modification of MLE that does not rely on the prior estimation of the heterogeneous intensity and is thus applicable in a data-limited regime (e.g., few-shot, unrepeated observations). Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones by notable margins, with highlighted novel applications in neuroscience",

    "abstract": "Randomized experiments (REs) are the cornerstone for treatment effect evaluation. However, due to practical considerations, REs may encounter difficulty recruiting sufficient patients. External controls (ECs) can supplement REs to boost estimation efficiency. Yet, there may be incomparability between ECs and concurrent controls (CCs), resulting in misleading treatment effect evaluation. We introduce a novel bias function to measure the difference in the outcome mean functions between ECs and CCs. We show that the ANCOVA model augmented by the bias function for ECs renders a consistent estimator of the average treatment effect, regardless of whether or not the ANCOVA model is correct.  To accommodate possibly different structures of the ANCOVA model and the bias function, we propose a double penalty integration estimator (DPIE) with different penalization terms for the two functions. With an appropriate choice of penalty parameters, our DPIE ensures consistency, oracle property, and asymptotic normality even in the presence of model misspecification. DPIE is at least as efficient as the estimator derived from REs alone, validated through theoretical and experimental results",

    "title": "Adaptivity Complexity for Causal Graph Discovery",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery from interventional data is an important problem, where the task is to design an interventional strategy that learns the hidden ground truth causal graph $G(V,E)$ on $|V| = n$ nodes while minimizing the number of performed interventions. Most prior interventional strategies broadly fall into two categories: non-adaptive and adaptive. Non-adaptive strategies decide on a single fixed set of interventions to be performed while adaptive strategies can decide on which nodes to intervene on sequentially based on past interventions. While adaptive algorithms may use exponentially fewer interventions than their non-adaptive counterparts, there are practical concerns that constrain the amount of adaptivity allowed. Motivated by this trade-off, we study the problem of $r$-adaptivity, where the algorithm designer recovers the causal graph under a total of $r$ sequential rounds whilst trying to minimize the total number of interventions. For this problem, we provide a $r$-adaptive algorithm that achieves $O(\\min\\{r,\\log n\\} \\cdot n^{1/\\min\\{r,\\log n\\}})$ approximation with respect to the verification number, a well-known lower bound for adaptive algorithms. Furthermore, for every $r$, we show that our approximation is tight. Our definition of $r$-adaptivity interpolates nicely between the non-adaptive ($r=1$) and fully adaptive ($r=n$) settings where our approximation simplifies to $O(n)$ and $O(\\log n)$ respectively, matching the best-known approximation guarantees for both extremes. Our results also extend naturally to the bounded size interventions",

The aggregation stage can be posed as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, with the additional structure that the arms are grouped into categories (disjoint sets of items) and the ranking of arms within each category is known. We propose algorithms for selecting top K items in this setting under two learning objectives, namely minimizing regret over rounds and identifying the top K items within a fixed number of rounds. For each of the objectives, we provide sharp regret/error analysis using carefully defined notion of “gap” that exploits our problem structure. The resulting regret/error bounds strictly improve over prior work in combinatorial bandits literature. We also provide supporting evidence from simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic problems",

Parity probabilities can be extracted from a forecasted distribution for the output, but we show that such a strategy leads to theoretical unpredictability and poor practical performance. We then observe that although the original task was regression, parity calibration can be expressed as binary calibration. Drawing on this connection, we use an online binary calibration method to achieve parity calibration.

First, we show that the EC method achieves similar calibration performance to temperature scaling (TS) across different neural network architectures and data sets, all while requiring similar validation samples and computational resources. However, we argue that EC provides a principled method grounded on a Bayesian optimality principle known as the Nishimori identity. Next, we provide an asymptotic characterization of both TS and EC in a synthetic setting and show that their performance crucially depends on the target function. In particular, we discuss examples where EC significantly outperforms TS",

    "title": "Improvable Gap Balancing for Multi-Task Learning",
    "abstract": "In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient balancing has recently attracted more research interest than loss balancing since it often leads to better performance. However, loss balancing is much more efficient than gradient balancing, and thus it is still worth further exploration in MTL. Note that prior studies typically ignore that there exist varying improvable gaps across multiple tasks, where the improvable gap per task is defined as the distance between the current training progress and desired final training progress. Therefore, after loss balancing, the performance imbalance still arises in many cases. In this paper, following the loss balancing framework, we propose two novel improvable gap balancing (IGB) algorithms for MTL: one takes a simple heuristic, and the other (for the first time) deploys deep reinforcement learning for MTL. Particularly, instead of directly balancing the losses in MTL, both algorithms choose to dynamically assign task weights for improvable gap balancing. Moreover, we combine IGB and gradient balancing to show the complementarity between the two types of algorithms. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IGB algorithms lead to the best results in MTL via loss balancing and achieve further improvements when combined with gradient balancing.

Exiting state-of-the-art models rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e crystal graph structure, where they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information etc, which influence different crystal properties.  In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure and learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple multi-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe that fusing the textual representation with crystal graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own vanilla versions.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep  probabilistic model for hierarchical forecasting that is motivated by a classical top-down strategy. It jointly learns the distribution of the root time series, and the (dirichlet) proportions according to which each parent time-series is split among its children at any point in time. The resulting forecasts are naturally coherent, and provide probabilistic predictions over all time series in the hierarchy. We experiment on several public datasets and demonstrate significant improvements of up to 26% on most datasets compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Finally, we also provide theoretical justification for the superiority of our top-down approach compared to the more traditional bottom-up modeling",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic AI (NeSy) allows neural networks to exploit symbolic background knowledge in the form of logic. It has been shown to aid learning in the limited data regime and to facilitate inference on out-of-distribution data. Probabilistic NeSy focuses on integrating neural networks with both logic and probability theory, which additionally allows learning under uncertainty. A major limitation of current probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is their restriction to finite probability distributions, i.e., discrete random variables. In contrast, deep probabilistic programming (DPP) excels in modelling and optimising continuous probability distributions. Hence, we introduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language that incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of inference and learning of both discrete and continuous probability distributions under logical constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the semantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a proven asymptotically unbiased learning algorithm, and 3) a series of experiments that illustrate the versatility of our approach",

    "abstract": "By recursively summing node features over entire neighborhoods, spatial graph convolution operators have been heralded as key to the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Yet, despite the multiplication of GNN methods across tasks and applications, the effect of this aggregation operation has yet to be analyzed. In fact, while most recent efforts in the GNN community have focused on optimizing the architecture of the neural network, fewer works have attempted to characterize  (a)  the different classes of spatial convolution operators, (b) their impact on the geometry of the embedding space, and (c) how the choice of a particular convolution should relate to properties of the data. In this paper, we propose to answer all three questions by dividing existing operators into two main classes (symmetrized vs. row-normalized spatial convolutions), and show how these correspond to different implicit biases on the data. Finally, we show that this convolution operator is in fact tunable, and explicit regimes in which certain choices of convolutions — and therefore, embedding geometries — might be more appropriate",

Our contributions include the derivation of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used for learning the model parameters, which results in an upper-bound on the log-likelihood of training data over that of standard deep ensembles.  Additionally, the proposed EM training procedure allows for learning of mixture weights, which is not commonly done in ensembles.

To capture such item relationships effectively, the recommenders need to understand why subsets of items are co-viewed or co-purchased by the customers. Graph-based models, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), provide a natural framework to combine, ingest and extract valuable insights from such high-order item relationships. However, learning GNNs effectively for I2I requires ingesting a large amount of relational data, which might not always be available, especially in new, emerging market segments. To mitigate this data bottleneck, we postulate that recommendation patterns learned from existing market segments (with private data) could be adapted to build effective warm-start models for emerging ones. To achieve this, we introduce a personalized graph adaptation model based on GNNs to summarize, assemble and adapt recommendation patterns across market segments with heterogeneous customer behaviors into effective local models",

    "abstract": "Data for pretraining machine learning models often consists of collections of heterogeneous datasets. Although training on their union is reasonable in agnostic settings, it might be suboptimal when the target domain —where the model will ultimately be used— is known in advance. In that case, one would ideally pretrain only on the dataset(s) most similar to the target one. Instead of limiting this choice to those datasets already present in the pretraining collection, here we explore extending this search to all datasets that can be synthesized as ‘combinations’ of them. We define such combinations as multi-dataset interpolations, formalized through the notion of generalized geodesics from optimal transport (OT) theory. We compute these geodesics using a recent notion of distance between labeled datasets, and derive alternative interpolation schemes based on it: using either barycentric projections or optimal transport maps, the latter computed using recent neural OT methods. These methods are scalable, efficient, and —notably— can be used to interpolate even between datasets with distinct and unrelated label sets. Through various experiments in transfer learning in computer vision, we demonstrate this is a promising new approach for targeted on-demand dataset synthesis",

It is especially pertinent to autoregressive sequence tasks, where training and inference costs are typically very high. However, existing research has predominantly focused on tasks with static data such as image classification. In this work, we investigate Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) applied to large-scale natural language sequence-to-sequence data. EDD aims to compress the superior uncertainty performance of an expensive (teacher) ensemble into a cheaper (student) single model. Importantly, the ability to separate knowledge (epistemic) and data (aleatoric) uncertainty is retained. Existing probability-space approaches to EDD, however, are difficult to scale to large vocabularies. We show, for modern transformer architectures on large-scale translation tasks, that modelling the ensemble logits, instead of softmax probabilities, leads to significantly better students. Moreover, the students surprisingly even outperform Deep Ensembles by up to $\\sim$10% AUROC on out-of-distribution detection, whilst matching them at in-distribution translation",

    "abstract": "When perceiving the world from multiple viewpoints, humans have the ability to reason about the complete objects in a compositional manner even when an object is completely occluded from certain viewpoints. Meanwhile, humans are able to imagine novel views after observing multiple viewpoints. Recent remarkable advances in multi-view object-centric learning still leaves some unresolved problems: 1) The shapes of partially or completely occluded objects can not be well reconstructed. 2) The novel viewpoint prediction depends on expensive viewpoint annotations rather than implicit rules in view representations. In this paper, we introduce a time-conditioned generative model for videos. To reconstruct the complete shape of an object accurately, we enhance the disentanglement between the latent representations of objects and views, where the latent representations of time-conditioned views are jointly inferred with a Transformer and then are input to a sequential extension of Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. In addition, Gaussian processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for video generation and novel-view prediction without viewpoint annotations. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed model can make object-centric video decomposition, reconstruct the complete shapes of occluded objects, and make novel-view predictions",

    "abstract": "Information-theoretic clustering is one of the most promising and principled approaches to finding clusters with minimal apriori assumptions. The key criterion therein is to maximize the mutual information between the data points and their cluster labels. Such an approach, however, does not explicitly promote any type of inter-cluster behavior. We instead propose to maximize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the underlying data distributions associated to clusters (referred to as cluster distributions). We show it to entail the mutual information criterion along with maximizing cross entropy between the cluster distributions. For practical efficiency, we propose to empirically estimate the objective of KL-D between clusters in its dual form leveraging deep neural nets as a dual function approximator. Remarkably, our theoretical analysis establishes that estimating the divergence measure in its dual form simplifies the problem of clustering to one of optimally finding k-1 cut points for k clusters in the 1-D dual functional space. Overall, our approach enables linear-time clustering algorithms with theoretical guarantees of near-optimality, owing to the submodularity of the objective. We show the empirical superiority of our approach w.r.t. current state-of-the-art methods on the challenging task of clustering noisy timeseries as observed in domains such as neuroscience, healthcare, financial markets, spatio-temporal environmental dynamics, etc",

The corollary to this problem is the detection in-distribution (ID) samples, which is applicable to domain adaptation scenarios for augmenting a train set with ID samples from other data sets, or to continual learning for replay from the past. For both ID or OOD detection, we propose a principled yet simple approach of (empirically) estimating KL-Divergence, in its dual form, for a given test set w.r.t. a known set of ID samples in order to quantify the contribution of each test sample individually towards the divergence measure and accordingly detect it as OOD or ID.

This task is also known as inverse reinforcement learning. Maximum likelihood estimation for such models requires dynamic programming, which is limited by the curse of dimensionality [Bellman, 1957]. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that provides a data-driven method for selecting and aggregating states, which lowers the computational and sample complexity of estimation. Our method works in two stages. First, we estimate agent Qfunctions, and leverage them alongside a clustering algorithm to select a subset of states that are most pivotal for driving changes in Q-functions. Second, with these selected \"aggregated\" states, we conduct maximum likelihood estimation using a popular nested fixed-point algorithm [Rust, 1987]. The proposed two-stage approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality by reducing the problem dimension. Theoretically, we derive finite-sample bounds on the associated estimation error, which also characterize the trade-off of computational complexity, estimation error, and sample complexity. We demonstrate the empirical performance of the algorithm in two classic dynamic discrete choice estimation applications",

In the context of density estimation, the standard nonparametric Bayesian approach is to target the posterior predictive of the Dirichlet process mixture model. In general, direct estimation of the posterior predictive is intractable and so methods typically resort to approximating the posterior distribution as an intermediate step. The recent development of quasi-Bayesian predictive copula updates, however, has made it possible to perform tractable predictive density estimation without the need for posterior approximation. Although these estimators are computationally appealing, they struggle on non-smooth data distributions. This is due to the comparatively restrictive form of the likelihood models from which the proposed copula updates were derived. To address this shortcoming, we consider a Bayesian nonparametric model with an autoregressive likelihood decomposition and a Gaussian process prior. While the predictive update of such a model is typically intractable, we derive a quasi-Bayesian update that achieves state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes",

We consider the challenge of survival prediction: learning, from such data, a predictive model that can produce an individual survival distribution for a novel instance. Many contemporary methods of survival prediction implicitly assume that the event and censoring distributions are independent conditional on the instance’s covariates - a strong assumption that is difficult to verify (as we observe only one outcome for each instance) and which can induce significant bias when it does not hold. This paper presents a parametric model of survival that extends modern non-linear survival analysis by relaxing the assumption of conditional independence.

Given a testing example and a trained classifier, CP produces a prediction set of candidate labels with a user-specified  coverage (i.e., true class label is contained with high probability). Almost all the existing work on CP assumes clean testing data and there is not much known about the robustness of CP algorithms w.r.t natural/adversarial perturbations to testing examples. This paper studies the problem of probabilistically robust conformal prediction (PRCP) which ensures robustness to most perturbations around clean input examples. PRCP generalizes the standard CP (cannot handle perturbations) and adversarially robust CP (ensures robustness w.r.t worst-case perturbations) to achieve better trade-offs between nominal performance and robustness.  We propose a novel adaptive PRCP (aPRCP) algorithm to achieve probabilistically robust coverage. The key idea behind aPRCP is to determine two parallel thresholds, one for data samples and another one for the perturbations on data (aka \"quantile-of-quantile” design). We provide theoretical analysis to show that aPRCP algorithm achieves robust coverage.

In this work, we concentrate on the specific type of these models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). First, we unveil a significant theoretical flaw in the assumption of the classical VAE model. Second, we enforce an accommodating topological property to the image of the deep neural mapping to the latent space: compactness to alleviate the flaw and obtain the means to provably bound the image within the determined limits by squeezing both inliers and outliers together. We enforce compactness using two approaches: $(i)$ Alexandroff extension and  $(ii)$ fixed Lipschitz continuity constant on the mapping of the encoder of the VAEs.

We empirically show that neural networks have a tendency to learn lower-degree frequencies. We show how this spectral bias towards simpler features can in fact hurt the neural network’s generalization on real-world datasets. To remedy this we propose a new scalable functional regularization scheme that aids the neural network to learn higher degree frequencies. Our regularizer also helps avoid erroneous identification of low-degree frequencies, which further improves generalization.

To settle this issue, we investigate stochastic graphical bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the distributions have finite moments of order $1+\\epsilon$, for some $\\epsilon\\in(0, 1]$. Firstly, we develop one UCB-type algorithm, whose expected regret is upper bounded by a sum of gap-based quantities over the clique covering of the feedback graph. The key idea is to estimate the reward means of the selected arm’s neighbors by more refined robust estimators, and to construct a graph-based upper confidence bound for selecting candidates. Secondly, we design another elimination-based strategy and improve the regret bound to a gap-based sum with size controlled by the independence number of the feedback graph. For benign graphs, the independence number could be smaller than the size of the clique covering, resulting in tighter regret bounds.

Often, multiple datasets of the same system variables are available, for instance, time series of river runoff from different catchments. The local catchment systems then share certain causal parents, such as time-dependent large-scale weather over all catchments, but differ in other catchment-specific drivers, such as the altitude of the catchment. These drivers can be called temporal and spatial contexts, respectively, and are often partially unobserved. Pooling the datasets and considering the joint causal graph among system, context, and certain auxiliary variables enables us to overcome such latent confounding of system variables. In this work, we present a non-parametric time series causal discovery method, J(oint)-PCMCI$^+$, that efficiently learns such joint causal time series graphs when both observed and latent contexts are present, including time lags. We present asymptotic consistency results and numerical experiments demonstrating the utility and limitations of the method",

    "title": "Sufficient identification conditions and semiparametric estimation under missing not at random mechanisms",
    "abstract": "Conducting valid statistical analyses is challenging in the presence of missing-not-at-random (MNAR) data, where the missingness mechanism is dependent on the missing values themselves even conditioned on the observed data. Here, we consider a MNAR model that generalizes several prior popular MNAR models in two ways: first, it is less restrictive in terms of statistical independence assumptions imposed on the underlying joint data distribution, and second, it allows for all variables in the observed sample to have missing values. This MNAR model corresponds to a so-called criss-cross structure considered in the literature on graphical models of missing data that prevents nonparametric identification of the entire missing data model. Nonetheless, part of the complete-data distribution remains nonparametrically identifiable. By exploiting this fact and considering a rich class of exponential family distributions, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of the complete-data distribution as well as the entire missingness mechanism. We then propose methods for testing the independence restrictions encoded in such models using odds ratio as our parameter of interest. We adopt two semiparametric approaches for estimating the odds ratio parameter and establish the corresponding asymptotic theories: one involves maximizing a conditional likelihood with order statistics and the other uses estimating equations. The utility of our methods is illustrated via simulation studies",

    "abstract": "Understanding the differences between machine learning (ML) models is of interest in scenarios ranging from choosing amongst a set of competing models, to updating a deployed model with new training data. In these cases, we wish to go beyond differences in overall metrics such as accuracy to identify where in the feature space do the differences occur. We formalize this problem of model differencing as one of predicting a dissimilarity function of two ML models’ outputs, subject to the representation of the differences being human-interpretable. Our solution is to learn a Joint Surrogate Tree (JST), which is composed of two conjoined decision tree surrogates for the two models. A JST provides an intuitive representation of differences and places the changes in the context of the models’ decision logic. Context is important as it helps users to map differences to an underlying mental model of an AI system. We also propose a refinement procedure to increase the precision of a JST. We demonstrate, through an empirical evaluation, that such contextual differencing is concise and can be achieved with no loss in fidelity over naive approaches",

Focusing on DAGs with bounded vertex cover number—a class studied in Korhonen and Parviainen’s seminal work (NIPS 2015)—we answer the questions in the affirmative.

However, the need for addition and multiplication of high-degree polynomials incurs a significant additional factor in the complexity of inference. Here, we give a new inference algorithm that eliminates this extra factor. Specifically, we show that it suffices to keep track of the highest degree coefficients of the computed polynomials, rendering the algorithm linear in the circuit size. In addition, we show that determinant-based circuits need not be expanded to division-free circuits, but can be handled by division-based fast algorithms. While these advances enhance the appeal of PGCs, we also discover an obstacle to learning them from data: it is NP-hard to recognize whether a given PGC encodes a PGP.

This leads to a continuous sample path that is used to describe the underlying mechanism generating the arrival distribution. These models arise in many disciplines, such as financial settings where actions in a market are determined by a hidden continuous price or in neuroscience where a latent stimulus generates spike trains. Based on the developments in Itô’s excursion theory, we propose methods for inferring and sampling from the point process derived from the latent diffusion process.

Notably, Full-IS-TD($\\lambda$) is the only existing loosely consistent method under general linear function approximation but, unfortunately, has a high variance and is scarcely practical. This notorious high variance issue motivates the introduction of ETD($\\lambda$), which tames down the variance but has a biased fixed point.

However, recent work [Chattergee and Diaconis, 2018] indicates that the number of samples required for effective importance weighting is exponential in the number of latent variables. Attaining such a large number of importance samples is intractable in all but the smallest models. Here, we develop massively parallel RWS, which circumvents this issue by drawing $K$ samples of all $n$ latent variables, and individually reasoning about all $K^n$ possible combinations of samples.

Our proposed algorithms are inspired by Optimistic Thompson Sampling (O-TS), empirically studied in Chapelle and Li [2011], May et al. [2012] for stochastic multi-armed bandits. The key idea for the original O-TS is to clip the posterior distribution in an optimistic way  to ensure that the sampled models are always better than the empirical models. Both of our proposed algorithms are easy to implement and only need one posterior sample to construct an episode-dependent model. Our first  algorithm, Optimistic Thompson Sampling for MDPs (O-TS-MDP), achieves a $\\widetilde{O} \\left(\\sqrt{AS^2H^4T} \\right)$ regret bound, where $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the action space, $H$ is the number of time-steps per episode and $T$ is the number of episodes.

In this paper, we propose a multi-view graph contrastive learning (MVGCL) approach to enhance the generalization across different distributions, which exploits a graph pattern learner in a self-supervised fashion to facilitate a neural heuristic equipped with an active search scheme. Specifically, our MVGCL first leverages graph contrastive learning to extract transferable patterns from VRP graphs to attain the generalizable multi-view (i.e. node and graph) representation. Then it adopts the learnt node embedding and graph embedding to assist the neural heuristic and the active search (during inference) for route construction, respectively.

Many algorithms however work under the assumption that the reward is the sum of linear function of observed contexts and a sub-Gaussian error.

In such reward environments, algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian error may underexplore, resulting in suboptimal regret. In this paper, we relax the reward assumption and propose a novel linear bandit algorithm which works well under heavy-tailed errors as well. The proposed algorithm utilizes Huber regression. When contexts are stochastic with positive definite covariance matrix and the $(1+\\delta)$-th moment of the error is bounded by a constant, we show that the high-probability upper bound of the regret is $O(\\sqrt{d}T^{\\frac{1}{1+\\delta}}(\\log dT)^{\\frac{\\delta}{1+\\delta}})$, where $d$ is the dimension of context variables, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\\delta\\in (0,1]$. This bound improves on the state-of-the-art regret bound of the Median of Means and Truncation algorithm by a factor of $\\sqrt{\\log T}$ and $\\sqrt{d}$ for the case where the time horizon $T$ is unknown. We also remark that when $\\delta=1$, the order is the same as the regret bound of linear bandit algorithms designed for sub-Gaussian errors. We support our theoretical findings with synthetic experiments",

    "abstract": "In the emerging paradigm of Federated Learning (FL), large amount of clients such as mobile devices are used to train possibly high-dimensional models on their respective data. Combining (dimension-wise) adaptive gradient methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad) with FL has been an active direction, which is shown to outperform traditional SGD based FL in many cases. In this paper, we focus on the problem of training federated deep neural networks, and propose a novel FL framework which further introduces layer-wise adaptivity to the local model updates to accelerate the convergence of adaptive FL methods. Our framework includes two variants based on two recent locally adaptive federated learning algorithms. Theoretically, we provide a convergence analysis of our layer-wise FL methods, coined Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB, which match the convergence rate of state-of-the-art results in adaptive FL and exhibits linear speedup in terms of the number of workers. Experimental results on various datasets and models, under both IID and non-IID local data settings, show that both Fed-LAMB and Mime-LAMB achieve faster convergence speed and better generalization performance, compared to various recent adaptive FL methods",

    "abstract": "For the stable optimization of deep neural networks, regularization methods such as dropout and batch normalization have been used in various tasks. Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed, and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests. In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply dropout after global average pooling, we prove that applying dropout before global average pooling leads to a more stable output. The proposed guidelines are validated through experiments using different datasets and models",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) has been considered an imperative component for safely deploying neural network-based applications. However, it typically comes with slow convergence and worse performance on clean samples (i.e., non-adversarial samples). In this work, we analyze the behavior of neural networks during learning with adversarial samples through the lens of response frequency. Interestingly, we observe that AT causes neural networks to converge slowly to high-frequency information, resulting in highly oscillatory predictions near each data point. To learn high-frequency content efficiently, we first prove that a universal phenomenon, the frequency principle (i.e., lower frequencies are learned first), still holds in AT. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we present a novel approach to AT, which we call phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT). In PhaseAT, the high-frequency components, which are a contributing factor to slow convergence, are adaptively shifted into the low-frequency range where faster convergence occurs. For evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, using an adaptive attack that is carefully designed for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT substantially improves convergence for high-frequency information, thereby leading to improved adversarial robustness",

We address this challenge by proposing a risk-aware curriculum generation algorithm that simultaneously creates two curricula: 1) a primary curriculum that aims to maximize the expected discounted return with respect to a distribution over target tasks, and an auxiliary curriculum that identifies and over-samples rare and risky tasks observed in the primary curriculum.

The main algorithmic novelty is in the design of SHAdaVar, which allocates budget greedily based on overestimating the unknown reward variances. We bound probabilities of misidentifying the best arms in both SHVar and SHAdaVar. Our analyses rely on novel lower bounds on the number of pulls of an arm that do not require closed-form solutions to the budget allocation problem.

    "abstract": "Text classifiers built on Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various tasks including sentiment analysis, natural language inference, and question-answering. However, the occurrence of uncertain predictions by these classifiers poses a challenge to their reliability when deployed in practical applications. Much effort has been devoted to designing various probes in order to understand what PLMs capture. But few studies have delved into factors influencing PLM-based classifiers’ predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called CUE, which aims to interpret uncertainties inherent in the predictions of PLM-based models. In particular, we first map PLM-encoded representations to a latent space via a variational auto-encoder. We then generate text representations by perturbing the latent space which causes fluctuation in predictive uncertainty. By comparing the difference in predictive uncertainty between the perturbed and the original text representations, we are able to identify the latent dimensions responsible for uncertainty and subsequently trace back to the input features that contribute to such uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets encompassing linguistic acceptability classification, emotion classification, and natural language inference show the feasibility of our proposed framework.

Precisely, our quantum-accelerated voting algorithm outputs the correct winner with high probability in $\\Theta\\left(\\frac{n}{\\text{MOV}}\\right)$ time, where $n$ is the number of votes and $\\text{MOV}$ is margin of victory, the smallest number of voters to change the winner. In contrast, any classical voting algorithm based on sampling with replacement requires $\\Omega\\left(\\frac{n^2}{\\text{MOV}^2}\\right)$ time under a large class of voting rules. Our theoretical results are supported by experiments under plurality, Borda, Copeland, and STV",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are universal approximators and are studied for their use in solving differential equations.  However, a major criticism is the lack of error bounds for obtained solutions.  This paper proposes a technique to rigorously evaluate the error bound of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) on most linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear partial differential equations (PDEs).  The error bound is based purely on equation structure and residual information and does not depend on assumptions of how well the networks are trained.  We propose algorithms that bound the error efficiently. Some proposed algorithms provide tighter bounds than others at the cost of longer run time",

    "title": "No-Regret Linear Bandits beyond Realizability",
    "abstract": "We study linear bandits when the underlying reward function is not linear. Existing work relies on a uniform misspecification parameter $\\epsilon$ that measures the sup-norm error of the best linear approximation. This results in an unavoidable linear regret whenever $\\epsilon > 0$. We describe a more natural model of misspecification which only requires the approximation error at each input $x$ to be proportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$.  It captures the intuition that, for optimization problems, near-optimal regions should matter more and we can tolerate larger approximation errors in suboptimal regions. Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB algorithm — designed for the realizable case — is automatically robust against such gap-adjusted misspecification.  It achieves a near-optimal $\\sqrt{T}$ regret for problems that the best-known regret is almost linear in time horizon $T$. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding argument that bounds the part of the regret due to misspecification by the regret itself",

We model the function using kernel-based and Gaussian process methods, while differing from previous works in our assumption that the function is monotonically increasing with respect to a safety variable. This assumption is motivated by various practical applications such as adaptive clinical trial design and robotics. Taking inspiration from the GP-UCB and SAFEOPT algorithms, we propose an algorithm, monotone safe UCB (M-SafeUCB) for this task.  We show that M-SafeUCB enjoys theoretical guarantees in terms of safety, a suitably-defined regret notion, and approximately finding the entire safe boundary. In addition, we illustrate that the monotonicity assumption yields significant benefits in terms of the guarantees obtained, as well as algorithmic simplicity and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a non-parametric model that has been used in many real-world applications that involve sensitive personal data (e.g., healthcare, finance, etc.) from multiple data owners. To fully and securely exploit the value of different data sources, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving GPR method based on secret sharing (SS), a secure multi-party computation (SMPC) technique. In contrast to existing studies that protect the data privacy of GPR via homomorphic encryption, differential privacy, or federated learning, our proposed method is more practical and can be used to preserve the data privacy of both the model inputs and outputs for various data-sharing scenarios (e.g., horizontally/vertically-partitioned data). However, it is non-trivial to directly apply SS on the conventional GPR algorithm, as it includes some operations whose accuracy and/or efficiency have not been well-enhanced in the current SMPC protocol. To address this issue, we derive a new SS-based exponentiation operation through the idea of “confusion-correction” and construct an SS-based matrix inversion algorithm based on Cholesky decomposition. More importantly, we theoretically analyze the communication cost and the security of the proposed SS-based operations. Empirical results show that our proposed method can achieve reasonable accuracy and efficiency under the premise of preserving data privacy",

    "title": "Federated learning of models pre-trained on different features with consensus graphs",
    "abstract": "Learning an effective global model on private and decentralized datasets has become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning, enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance. Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction. This paper presents solutions to these problems and demonstrates them in real-world applications on time series data such as power grids and traffic networks",

    "title": "Random Reshuffling with Variance Reduction: New Analysis and Better Rates",
    "abstract": "Virtually all state-of-the-art methods for training supervised machine learning models are variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), enhanced with a number of additional tricks, such as minibatching, momentum, and adaptive stepsizes. However, one of the most basic questions in the design of  successful SGD methods, one that is orthogonal to the aforementioned tricks, is the choice of the next training data point to be learning from. Standard variants of SGD employ a  sampling with replacement strategy, which means that the next training data point is sampled from the entire data set, often independently of all previous samples. While standard SGD is well understood theoretically,  virtually all widely used machine learning software is based on  sampling without replacement as this is often empirically superior. That is, the training data is randomly shuffled/permuted, either only once at the beginning, strategy known as random shuffling (RS), or before every epoch, strategy known as random reshuffling (RR),  and  training proceeds in the data order dictated by the shuffling.  RS and RR strategies  have for a long time remained beyond the reach of  theoretical analysis that would satisfactorily explain their success. However, very recently, Mishchenko et al. [2020] provided tight  sublinear convergence rates through a novel analysis, and showed that these strategies can improve upon standard SGD in certain regimes. Inspired by these results, we seek to further  improve the rates of shuffling-based methods. In particular, we show that it is possible to enhance them with a variance reduction mechanism, obtaining linear convergence rates.\tTo the best of our knowledge, our linear convergence rates are the best for any method based on sampling without replacement",

    "title": "The Shrinkage-Delinkage Trade-off: an Analysis of Factorized Gaussian Approximations for Variational Inference",
    "abstract": "When factorized approximations are used for variational inference (VI), they tend to underestimate the uncertainty—as measured in various ways—of the distributions they are meant to approximate. We consider two popular ways to measure the uncertainty deficit of VI: (i) the degree to which it underestimates the componentwise variance, and (ii) the degree to which it underestimates the entropy. To better understand these effects, and the relationship between them, we examine an informative setting where they can be explicitly (and elegantly) analyzed: the approximation of a Gaussian, $p$, with a dense covariance matrix, by a Gaussian, $q$, with a diagonal covariance matrix. We prove that $q$ always underestimates both the componentwise variance and the entropy of $p$, though not necessarily to the same degree. Moreover we demonstrate that the entropy of $q$ is determined by the trade-off of two competing forces: it is decreased by the shrinkage of its componentwise variances (our first measure of uncertainty) but it is increased by the factorized approximation which delinks the nodes in the graphical model of $p$. We study various manifestations of this trade-off, notably one where, as the dimension of the problem grows, the per-component entropy gap between $p$ and $q$ becomes vanishingly small even though $q$ underestimates every componentwise variance by a constant multiplicative factor. We also use the shrinkage-delinkage trade-off to bound the entropy gap in terms of the problem dimension and the condition number of the correlation matrix of $p$. Finally we present empirical results on both Gaussian and non-Gaussian targets, the former to validate our analysis and the latter to explore its limitations",

A critical assumption needed to identify these effects is that all confounding variables—causal parents of both the treatment and the outcome—are included as covariates. Unfortunately, given observational data alone, we cannot know with certainty that this criterion is satisfied. Sensitivity analyses provide principled ways to give bounds on causal estimates when confounding variables are hidden. While much attention is focused on sensitivity analyses for discrete-valued treatments, much less is paid to continuous-valued treatments. We present novel methodology to bound both average and conditional average continuous-valued treatment-effect estimates when they cannot be point identified due to hidden confounding. A semi-synthetic benchmark on multiple datasets shows our method giving tighter coverage of the true dose-response curve than a recently proposed continuous sensitivity model and baselines. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world observational case study to demonstrate the value of identifying dose-dependent causal effects",

However, it takes inverse matrix roots of ill-conditioned matrices. This requires 64-bit precision, imposing strong hardware constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel factorization, Kronecker Approximation-Domination (KrAD). Using KrAD, we update a matrix that directly approximates the inverse empirical Fisher matrix (like full matrix AdaGrad), avoiding inversion and hence 64-bit precision. We then propose KrADagrad , with similar computational costs to Shampoo and the same regret.

In this field, a suitable behavioral distribution is employed for sampling, allowing diminishing the variance of the estimator below the one achievable when sampling from the target distribution. In this paper, we analyze IS in these two guises in the context of PO. We provide a novel view of off-policy PO, showing a connection between the policy improvement and variance minimization objectives. Then, we illustrate how minimizing the off-policy variance can, in some circumstances, lead to a policy improvement, with the advantage, compared with direct off-policy learning, of implicitly enforcing a trust region.

    "abstract": "The Right to Explanation is an important regulatory principle that allows individuals to request actionable explanations for algorithmic decisions. However, several technical challenges arise when providing such actionable explanations in practice. For instance, models are periodically retrained to handle dataset shifts. This process may invalidate some of the previously prescribed explanations, thus rendering them unactionable. But, it is unclear if and when such invalidations occur, and what factors determine explanation stability i.e., if an explanation remains unchanged amidst model retraining due to dataset shifts. In this paper, we address the aforementioned gaps and provide one of the first theoretical and empirical characterizations of the factors influencing explanation stability. To this end, we conduct rigorous theoretical analysis to demonstrate that model curvature, weight decay parameters while training, and the magnitude of the dataset shift are key factors that determine the extent of explanation (in)stability. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets not only validates our theoretical results, but also demonstrates that the aforementioned factors dramatically impact the stability of explanations produced by various state-of-the-art methods",

To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Quantile Neural Processes (CQNPs), a new member of the neural processes family, which exploits the attractive properties of quantile regression in modeling the distributions irrespective of their form. By introducing an extension of quantile regression where the model learns to focus on estimating informative quantiles, we show that the sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy can be further enhanced.

However, most active learning strategies are designed to either learn a representation of the data (e.g., embedding or metric learning) or perform well on a task (e.g., classification) on the data. However, many machine learning tasks involve a combination of both representation learning and a task-specific goal. Motivated by this, we propose a novel unified query framework that can be applied to any problem in which a key component is learning a representation of the data that reflects similarity. Our approach builds on similarity or nearest neighbor (NN) queries which seek to select samples that result in improved embeddings. The queries consist of a reference and a set of objects, with an oracle selecting the object most similar (i.e., nearest) to the reference. In order to reduce the number of solicited queries, they are chosen adaptively according to an information theoretic criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on two tasks - active metric learning and active classification - using a variety of synthetic and real world datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that actively selected NN queries outperform recently developed active triplet selection methods in a deep metric learning setting. Further, we show that in classification, actively selecting class labels can be reformulated as a process of selecting the most informative NN query, allowing direct application of our method",

    "title": "Efficient Failure Pattern Identification of Predictive Algorithms",
    "abstract": "Given a (machine learning) classifier and a collection of unlabeled data, how can we efficiently identify misclassification patterns presented in this dataset? To address this problem, we propose a human-machine collaborative framework that consists of a team of human annotators and a sequential recommendation algorithm. The recommendation algorithm is conceptualized as a stochastic sampler that, in each round, queries the annotators a subset of samples for their true labels and obtains the feedback information on whether the samples are misclassified. The sampling mechanism needs to balance between discovering new patterns of misclassification (exploration) and confirming the potential patterns of classification (exploitation). We construct a determinantal point process, whose intensity balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off through the weighted update of the posterior at each round to form the generator of the stochastic sampler. The numerical results empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our framework on multiple datasets at various signal-to-noise ratios",

For sensor selection problems, for instance, this enables modeling of which type  of sensor to put at a location, not simply whether to put a sensor or not.   We propose and analyze threshold-greedy algorithms for both types of constraints.  We prove that our proposed algorithms achieve the best known approximation ratios for both constraint types, up to a user-chosen parameter that balances computational complexity and the approximation ratio, while only using a number of function evaluations that depends linearly (up to poly-logarithmic terms) on the number of elements n, the number of types k, and the inverse of the user chosen parameter.  Other algorithms that achieve the best-known deterministic approximation ratios require a number of  function evaluations that depends linearly on the budget B, while our methods do not.

    "title": "An improved variational approximate posterior for the deep Wishart process",
    "abstract": "Deep kernel processes are a recently introduced class of deep Bayesian models that have the flexibility of neural networks, but work entirely with Gram matrices. They operate by alternately sampling a Gram matrix from a distribution over positive semi-definite matrices, and applying a deterministic transformation. When the distribution is chosen to be Wishart, the model is called a deep Wishart process (DWP). This particular model is of interest because its prior is equivalent to a deep Gaussian process (DGP) prior, but at the same time it is invariant to rotational symmetries, leading to a simpler posterior distribution. Practical inference in the DWP was made possible in recent work (“A variational approximate posterior for the deep Wishart process” Ober and Aitchison, 2021a) where the authors used a generalisation of the Bartlett decomposition of the Wishart distribution as the variational approximate posterior. However, predictive performance in that paper was less impressive than one might expect, with the DWP only beating a DGP on a few of the UCI datasets used for comparison. In this paper, we show that further generalising their distribution to allow linear combinations of rows and columns in the Bartlett decomposition results in better predictive performance, while incurring negligible additional computation cost",

We relax this assumption and investigate incentives when predictions are performative, i.e., when they can influence the outcome of the prediction, such as when making public predictions about the stock market. We say a prediction is a fixed point if it accurately reflects the expert’s beliefs after that prediction has been made. We show that in this setting, reports maximizing expected score generally do not reflect an expert’s beliefs, and we give bounds on the inaccuracy of such reports. We show that, for binary predictions, if the influence of the expert’s prediction on outcomes is bounded, it is possible to define scoring rules under which optimal reports are arbitrarily close to fixed points. However, this is impossible for predictions over more than two outcomes. We also perform numerical simulations in a toy setting, showing that our bounds are tight in some situations and that prediction error is often substantial (greater than 5-10%). Lastly, we discuss alternative notions of optimality, including performative stability, and show that they incentivize reporting fixed points",

Approximate posterior samples can produce effective actions, but only if they reasonably approximate joint predictive distributions of outputs across inputs. Notably, accuracy of marginal predictive distributions does not suffice. Epistemic neural networks (ENNs) are designed to produce accurate joint predictive distributions. We compare a range of ENNs through computational experiments that assess their performance in approximating TS across bandit and reinforcement learning environments. The results indicate that ENNs serve this purpose well and illustrate how the quality of joint predictive distributions drives performance.

Current robustness certificates for graph classifiers guarantee output invariance with respect to the total number of node pair flips (edge addition or edge deletion), which amounts to an {$l_{0}$} ball centred on the adjacency matrix. Although theoretically attractive, this type of isotropic structural noise can be too restrictive in practical scenarios where some node pairs are more critical than others in determining the classifier’s output. The certificate, in this case, gives a pessimistic depiction of the robustness of the graph model. To tackle this issue, we develop a randomised smoothing method based on adding an anisotropic noise distribution to the input graph structure. We show that our process generates structural-aware certificates for our classifiers, whereby the magnitude of robustness certificates can vary across different pre-defined structures of the graph.

Given two submodular functions f and g where f is monotone, the objective of SCSKC problem is to find a  set S of size at most k  that maximizes f(S) under the constraint that g(S) < theta, for a given value of theta. The problem of DiffC focuses on finding a set S of size at most k such that h(S) = f(S)-g(S) is maximized. It is known that these problems are highly inapproximable and do not admit any constant factor multiplicative approximation algorithms unless NP is easy. Known approximation algorithms involve  data-dependent approximation factors that are not efficiently computable.  We initiate a study of the design of approximation algorithms where the approximation factors are efficiently computable. For the problem of SCSKC, we prove that the greedy algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least (1-1/e)f(OPT) - A, where A is the data-dependent additive error. For the DiffC problem, we design an algorithm that uses the SCSKC greedy algorithm as a subroutine. This algorithm produces a solution whose value is at least (1-1/e)h(OPT)-B, where B is also a data-dependent additive error.

In classification, current training schemes only target the complexity of the classifier itself, which can be misleading and ineffective. Instead, we advocate directly measuring the complexity of the decision boundary. Existing literature is limited in this area with few well-established definitions of boundary complexity. As a proof of concept, we start by analyzing ReLU neural networks, whose boundary complexity can be conveniently characterized by the number of affine pieces. With the help of tropical geometry, we develop a novel method that can explicitly count the exact number of boundary pieces, and as a by-product, the exact number of total affine pieces. Numerical experiments are conducted and distinctive properties of our boundary complexity are uncovered. First, the boundary piece count appears largely independent of other measures, e.g., total piece count, and $l_2$ norm of weights, during the training process. Second, the boundary piece count is negatively correlated with robustness, where popular robust training techniques, e.g., adversarial training or random noise injection, are found to reduce the number of boundary pieces",

    "abstract": "Visual object tracking has seen significant progress in recent years. However, the vast majority of this work focuses on tracking objects within the image plane of a single camera and ignores the uncertainty associated with predicted object locations. In this work, we focus on the geospatial object tracking problem using data from a distributed camera network. The goal is to predict an object’s track in geospatial coordinates along with uncertainty over the object’s location while respecting communication constraints that prohibit centralizing raw image data. We present a novel single-object geospatial tracking data set that includes high-accuracy ground truth object locations and video data from a network of four cameras. We present a modeling framework for addressing this task including a novel backbone model and explore how uncertainty calibration and fine-tuning through a differentiable tracker affect performance",

    "abstract": "We study algorithms for online  change-point detection (OCPD), where samples that are potentially heavy-tailed, are presented one at a time and a change in the underlying mean must be detected as early as possible. We present an algorithm based on clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), that works even if we only assume that the second moment of the data generating process is bounded. We derive guarantees on worst-case, finite-sample false-positive rate (FPR) over the family of all distributions with bounded second moment. Thus, our method is the first OCPD algorithm that guarantees finite-sample FPR, even if the data is high dimensional and  the underlying distributions are heavy-tailed. The technical contribution of our paper is to show that clipped-SGD can estimate the mean of a random vector and simultaneously provide confidence bounds at all confidence values. We combine this robust estimate with a union bound argument and construct a sequential change-point algorithm with finite-sample FPR guarantees. We show empirically that our algorithm works well in a variety of situations, whether the underlying data are heavy-tailed, light-tailed, high dimensional or discrete. No other algorithm achieves bounded FPR theoretically or empirically, over all settings we study simultaneously",

Here, an optimal intervention in A is one that maximizes the expected value for a designated reward variable in the graph, and we use the standard notion of simple regret to quantify near optimality. Considering Bernoulli random variables and for causal graphs on N vertices with constant in-degree, prior work has achieved a worst case guarantee of O(N/sqrt(T)) for simple regret. The current work utilizes the idea of covering interventions (which are not necessarily contained within A) and establishes a simple regret guarantee of O(sqrt(N/T)). Notably, and in contrast to prior work, our simple regret bound depends only on explicit parameters of the problem instance. We also go beyond prior work and achieve a simple regret guarantee for causal graphs with unobserved variables. Further, we perform experiments to show improvements over baselines in this setting",

    "abstract": "Message passing on factor graphs is a powerful framework for probabilistic inference, which finds important applications in various scientific domains. The most wide-spread message passing scheme is the sum-product algorithm (SPA) which gives exact results on trees but often fails on graphs with many small cycles. We search for an alternative message passing algorithm that works particularly well on such cyclic graphs. Therefore, we challenge the extrinsic principle of the SPA, which loses its objective on graphs with cycles. We further replace the local SPA message update rule at the factor nodes of the underlying graph with a generic mapping, which is optimized in a data-driven fashion. These modifications lead to a considerable improvement in performance while preserving the simplicity of the SPA. We evaluate our method for two classes of cyclic graphs: the 2x2 fully connected Ising grid and factor graphs for symbol detection on linear communication channels with inter-symbol interference. To enable the method for large graphs as they occur in practical applications, we develop a novel loss function that is inspired by the Bethe approximation from statistical physics and allows for training in an unsupervised fashion",

We focus on solving a sequence of bandit optimization tasks and develop LIBO, an algorithm which adapts to the environment by learning from past experience and becomes more sample-efficient in the process. We assume a kernelized structure where the kernel is unknown but shared across all tasks. LIBO sequentially meta-learns a kernel that approximates the true kernel and solves the incoming tasks with the latest kernel estimate. Our algorithm can be paired with any kernelized or linear bandit algorithm and guarantees oracle optimal performance, meaning that as more tasks are solved, the regret of LIBO on each task converges to the regret of the bandit algorithm with oracle knowledge of the true kernel. Naturally, if paired with a sublinear bandit algorithm, LIBO yields a sublinear lifelong regret. We also show that direct access to the data from each task is not necessary for attaining sublinear regret. We propose F-LIBO, which solves the lifelong problem in a federated manner",

Previous methods address this problem by leveraging an off-the-shelf detector, heuristic post-grouping process or explicit instance identification process, hindering further improvements in the inference speed which is an important factor for practical applications. From the statistical point of view, those additional processes for identifying instances are necessary to bypass learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints, which is a critical factor for another major challenge, the occlusion scenario. In this work, we propose a novel framework of single-stage instance-aware pose estimation by modeling the joint distribution of human keypoints with a mixture density model, termed as MDPose. Our MDPose estimates the distribution of human keypoints’ coordinates using a mixture density model with an instance-aware keypoint head consisting simply of 8 convolutional layers. It is trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the ground truth keypoints. Also, we propose a simple yet effective training strategy, Random Keypoint Grouping (RKG), which significantly alleviates the underflow problem leading to successful learning of relations between keypoints. On OCHuman dataset, which consists of images with highly occluded people, our MDPose achieves state-of-the-art performance by successfully learning the high-dimensional joint distribution of human keypoints. Furthermore, our MDPose shows significant improvement in inference speed with a competitive accuracy on MS COCO, a widely-used human keypoint dataset, thanks to the proposed much simpler single-stage pipeline",

We explore if this phenomenon is a fundamental property of models with ReLU activations, or if it is a weakness of current attack strategies. We first study the training dynamics of small MLPs with ReLU activations and identify redundant model parameters that do not memorise training examples. Building on this, we propose our Mnemonist method, which is able to detect redundant model parameters, and then guide current attacks to focus on informative parameters to improve the quality of reconstructions of training examples from ReLU models",

    "abstract": "Most research in deep learning has predominantly focused on the development of new models and training procedures. In contrast, the exploration of training objectives has received considerably less attention, often limited to combinations of standard losses. When dealing with complex structured outputs, the effectiveness of conventional objectives as proxies for the true objective becomes can be questionable. In this study, we propose that existing inference network-based methods for structured prediction, as observed in previous works [Tu and Gimpel, 2018, Tu et al., 2020a], indirectly learn to optimize a dynamic loss objective parameterized by the energy model. Based on this insight, we propose a method that treats the energy network as a trainable loss function and employs an implicit-gradient-based technique to learn the corresponding dynamic objective. We experiment with multiple tasks such as multi-label classification, entity recognition etc., and find significant performance improvements over baseline approaches. Our results demonstrate that implicitly learning a dynamic loss landscape proves to be an effective approach for enhancing model performance in structured prediction tasks",

    "abstract": "Computational efficiency is a major bottleneck in using classic graph-based approaches for semi-supervised learning on datasets with a large number of unlabeled examples. Known techniques to improve efficiency typically involve an approximation of the graph regularization objective, but suffer two major drawbacks - first the graph is assumed to be known or constructed with heuristic hyperparameter values, second they do not provide a principled approximation guarantee for learning over the full unlabeled dataset. Building on recent work on learning graphs for semi-supervised learning from multiple datasets for problems from the same domain, and leveraging techniques for fast approximations for solving linear systems in the graph Laplacian matrix, we propose algorithms that overcome both the above limitations.  We show a formal separation in the learning-theoretic complexity of sparse and dense graph families. We further show how to approximately learn the best graphs from the sparse families efficiently using the conjugate gradient method. Our approach can also be used to learn the graph efficiently online with sub-linear regret, under mild smoothness assumptions. Our online learning results are stated generally, and may be useful for approximate and efficient parameter tuning in other problems. We implement our approach and demonstrate significant ($\\sim$10-100x) speedups over prior work on semi-supervised learning with learned graphs on benchmark datasets",

A polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of the problem, when no background knowledge  constraints are specified, was given by Wienöbst, Bannach, and Liskiewicz (AAAI 2021), who also showed that the general case is NP-hard (in fact, #P-hard).  In this paper, we show that the problem is nevertheless tractable in an interesting class of instances, by establishing that it is “fixed-parameter tractable”: we give an algorithm that runs in time $O(k! k^2 n^4)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the MEC and $k$ is the maximum number of nodes in any maximal clique of the MEC that participate in the specified background knowledge constraints.

    "abstract": "We focus on the learning of generalized neural policies for Relational Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) expressed in RDDL. Recent work first converts the instances of a relational domain into an instance graph, and then trains a Graph Attention Network (GAT) of fixed depth with parameters shared across instances to learn a state representation, which can be decoded to get the policy [sharma et al., 22]. Unfortunately, this approach struggles to learn policies that exploit long-range dependencies – a fact we formally prove in this paper. As a remedy, we first construct a novel influence graph characterized by edges capturing one-step influence (dependence) between nodes based on the transition model. We then define influence distance between two nodes as the shortest path between them in this graph – a feature we exploit to represent long-range dependencies. We show that our architecture, referred to as Symbolic Influence Network (SymNet3.0), with its distance-based features, does not suffer from the representational issues faced by earlier approaches. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that we are competitive with existing baselines on 12 standard IPPC domains, and perform significantly better on six additional domains (including IPPC variants), designed to test a model’s capability in capturing long-range dependencies. Further analysis shows that SymNet3.0 automatically learns to focus on nodes that have key information for representing policies that capture long-range dependencies",

More specifically, RLFA satisfy two properties: (i) if $\\mathcal{A}$ is false, they correctly disprove it with probability at least $1-\\delta$, and (ii) they validate the correctness of $\\mathcal{A}$ with probability $1$, if it is true. We propose a general RLFA strategy, by  constructing new confidence sequences (CSs)  for the weighted average of $N$ unknown values,  based on samples drawn without replacement  from a (randomized) weighted sampling scheme.  Next, we develop methods to improve the quality of CSs by incorporating side information about  the unknown values. We show that when the side information is sufficiently accurate, it can directly drive the sampling. For the case where the accuracy is unknown a priori, we introduce an alternative approach using control variates. Crucially, our construction adapts to the quality of side information by strongly leveraging the side information if it is highly predictive, and learning to ignore it if it is uninformative.  Our methods also recover the state-of-the-art bounds for the special case of uniformly sampled observations with no side information, which has already found applications in election auditing. The harder weighted case with general side information solves the more challenging problem of AI-assisted financial auditing",

Moreover, we find that scalar, Markovian rewards are unable to express most of the instances in each of these three classes. We thereby contribute to a more complete understanding of what standard reward functions can and cannot express.

To solve these problems, we propose ViBid algorithm, which resolves the complexity problem of $O(N^2)$ by replacing Softmax with bidirectional normalization (BiNorm). In addition, it has a much simpler architecture than the existing transformer model with $O(N)$ complexity. Owing to our simple architecture, we were able to use larger resolutions for training, and we obtained a lighter and superior GPU throughput model with competitive performance.

Specifically, we focus on three settings that are still far from well understood:  (1) DP-SCO over a  constrained and bounded (convex) set in Euclidean space; (2) unconstrained DP-SCO in $\\ell_p^d$ space; (3) DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data over a  constrained and bounded set in $\\ell_p^d$ space.

    "title": "On the informativeness of supervision signals",
    "abstract": "Supervised learning typically focuses on learning transferable representations from training examples annotated by humans. While rich annotations (like soft labels) carry more information than sparse annotations (like hard labels), they are also more expensive to collect. For example, while hard labels only provide information about the closest class an object belongs to (e.g., “this is a dog”), soft labels provide information about the object’s relationship with multiple classes (e.g., “this is most likely a dog, but it could also be a wolf or a coyote”). We use information theory to compare how a number of commonly-used supervision signals contribute to representation-learning performance, as well as how their capacity is affected by factors such as the number of labels, classes, dimensions, and noise. Our framework provides theoretical justification for using hard labels in the big-data regime, but richer supervision signals for few-shot learning and out-of-distribution generalization. We validate these results empirically in a series of experiments with over 1 million crowdsourced image annotations and conduct a cost-benefit analysis to establish a tradeoff curve that enables users to optimize the cost of supervising representation learning on their own datasets",

Our approach, called meta learning CVs (Meta-CVs),  can be used for up to hundreds or thousands of tasks.

    "abstract": "In representative democracies, regular election cycles are supposed to prevent misbehavior by elected officials, hold them accountable, and subject them to the “will of the people.\" Pandering, or dishonest preference reporting by candidates campaigning for election, undermines this democratic idea. Much of the work on Computational Social Choice to date has investigated strategic actions in only a single election. We introduce a novel formal model of pandering and examine the resilience of two voting systems, Representative Democracy (RD) and Flexible Representative Democracy (FRD), to pandering within a single election and across multiple rounds of elections. For both voting systems, our analysis centers on the types of strategies candidates employ and how voters update their views of candidates based on how the candidates have pandered in the past. We provide theoretical results on the complexity of pandering in our setting for a single election, formulate our problem for multiple cycles as a Markov Decision Process, and use reinforcement learning to study the effects of pandering by single candidates and groups of candidates over many rounds",

Albeit the compelling empirical performance, the vanilla sparse graph ignores the geometric information of the data by performing sparse representation for each datum separately. In order to obtain a sparse graph aligned with the local geometric structure of data, we propose a novel Support Regularized Sparse Graph, abbreviated as SRSG, for data clustering. SRSG encourages local smoothness on the neighborhoods of nearby data points by a well-defined support regularization term. We propose a fast proximal gradient descent method to solve the non-convex optimization problem of SRSG with the convergence matching the Nesterov’s optimal convergence rate of first-order methods on smooth and convex objective function with Lipschitz continuous gradient. Extensive experimental results on various real data sets demonstrate the superiority of SRSG over other competing clustering methods",

    "title": "Two-stage Kernel Bayesian Optimization in High Dimensions",
    "abstract": "Bayesian optimization is a popular method for optimizing expensive black-box functions. Yet it oftentimes struggles in high dimensions, where the computation could be prohibitively heavy. While a complex kernel with many length scales is prone to overfitting and expensive to train, a simple coarse kernel with too few length scales cannot effectively capture the variations of the high dimensional function in different directions. To alleviate this problem, we introduce CobBO: a Bayesian optimization algorithm with two-stage kernels and a coordinate backoff stopping rule. It adaptively selects a promising low dimensional subspace and projects past measurements into it using a computational efficient coarse kernel. Within the subspace, the computational cost of conducting Bayesian optimization with a more flexible and accurate kernel becomes affordable and thus a sequence of consecutive observations in the same subspace are collected until a stopping rule is met. Extensive evaluations show that CobBO finds solutions comparable to or better than other state-of-the-art methods for dimensions ranging from tens to hundreds, while reducing both the trial complexity and computational costs",

Such problem commonly arises in many applications where heterogeneous data are utilized and the correspondence among them are unknown, e.g., due to data mishandling or privacy concern. We show that, in some applications, it is possible to recover $M$ via solving a nuclear norm minimization problem. Moreover, under a proper low-rank condition on $M$, we derive a non-asymptotic error bound for the recovery of $M$. We propose an algorithm, $\\text{M}^3\\text{O}$ (Matrix recovery via Min-Max Optimization) which recasts this combinatorial problem as a continuous minimax optimization problem and solves it by proximal gradient with a Max-Oracle. $\\text{M}^3\\text{O}$ can also be applied to a more general scenario where we have missing entries in $M_o$ and multiple groups of data with distinct unknown correspondence.

Our proposed tri-level optimization framework utilizes local predictors, which are trained on a small amount of data, as well as a fair and class-balanced predictor at the middle and lower levels. To effectively overcome saddle points for minority classes, our lower-level formulation incorporates sharpness-aware minimization. Meanwhile, at the upper level, the framework dynamically adjusts the loss function based on validation loss, ensuring a close alignment between the global predictor and local predictors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the framework’s ability to enhance classification and fairness generalization, potentially resulting in improvements in the generalization bound. Empirical results validate the superior performance of our tri-level framework compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    "title": "SPDF: Sparse Pre-training and Dense Fine-tuning for Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has contributed to a number of breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Instead of directly training on a downstream task, language models are first pre-trained on large datasets with cross-domain knowledge (e.g., Pile, MassiveText, etc.) and then fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., natural language generation, text summarization, etc.). Scaling the model and dataset size has helped improve the performance of LLMs, but unfortunately, this also lead to highly prohibitive computational costs. Pre-training LLMs often require orders of magnitude more FLOPs than fine-tuning and the model capacity often remains the same between the two phases. To achieve training efficiency w.r.t training FLOPs, we propose to decouple the model capacity between the two phases and introduce Sparse Pre-training and Dense Fine-tuning (SPDF). In this work, we show the benefits of using unstructured weight sparsity to train only a subset of weights during pre-training (Sparse Pre-training) and then recover the representational capacity by allowing the zeroed weights to learn (Dense Fine-tuning). We demonstrate that we can induce up to 75% sparsity into a 1.3B parameter GPT-3 XL model resulting in a 2.5x reduction in pre-training FLOPs, without a significant loss in accuracy on the downstream tasks relative to the dense baseline. By rigorously evaluating multiple downstream tasks, we also establish a relationship between sparsity, task complexity and dataset size. Our work presents a promising direction to train large GPT models at a fraction of the training FLOPs using weight sparsity, while retaining the benefits of pre-trained textual representations for downstream tasks",

However, in settings such as content moderation, accurately and reliably labeled data comes at substantial cost. If a learning algorithm has to pay for reward information, for example by asking a human for feedback, how does this change the exploration/exploitation tradeoff? We study this question in the context of bandit learning. Specifically, we investigate Bandits with Costly Reward Observations, where a cost needs to be paid in order to observe the reward of the bandit’s action. We show that the observation cost implies an $\\Omega(c^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ lower bound on the regret. Furthermore, we develop a general non-adaptive bandit algorithm which matches this lower bound, and we present several competitive adaptive learning algorithms for both k-armed and contextual bandits",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a cooperative multi-agent bandit scenario in which the rewards observed by agents are heterogeneous—one agent’s meat can be another agent’s poison. Specifically, the total reward observed by each agent is the sum of two values: an arm-specific reward, capturing the intrinsic value of the arm, and a privately-known agent-specific reward, which captures the personal preference/limitations of the agent. This heterogeneity in total reward leads to different local optimal arms for agents but creates an opportunity for \\textit{free exploration} in a cooperative setting—an agent can freely explore its local optimal arm with no regret and share this free observation with some other agents who would suffer regrets if they pull this arm since the arm is not optimal for them. We first characterize a regret lower bound that captures free exploration, i.e., arms that can be freely explored have no contribution to the regret lower bound. Then, we present a cooperative bandit algorithm that takes advantage of free exploration and achieves a near-optimal regret upper bound which tightly matches the regret lower bound up to a constant factor. Lastly, we run numerical simulations to compare our algorithm with various baselines without free exploration",

Specifically, we construct the probabilistic ensemble model by building a Gaussian distribution of the model parameters for each ensemble component using Laplacian approximation in a post-processing manner. Then a mixture of Gaussian model is established with learnable and refinable parameters in an EM-like algorithm. During ensemble training, we leverage the uncertainty estimated from previous models as guidance when training the next one such that the new model will focus more on the less explored regions by previous models.

    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation is a popular technique that has been shown to produce remarkable gains in average accuracy. However, recent work has shown that these gains are not uniform across subgroups in the data, and can often come at the cost of accuracy on rare subgroups and classes. Robust optimization is a common remedy to improve worst-class accuracy in standard learning settings, but in distillation it is unknown whether it is best to apply robust objectives when training the teacher, the student, or both. This work studies the interplay between robust objectives for the teacher and student. Empirically, we show that that jointly modifying the teacher and student objectives can lead to better worst-class student performance and even Pareto improvement in the trade-off between worst-class and overall performance. Theoretically, we show that the per-class calibration of teacher scores is key when training a robust student. Both the theory and experiments support the surprising finding that applying a robust teacher training objective does not always yield a more robust student",

However, the underlying factors driving the transferability of black-box adversarial examples still lack a thorough understanding. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate the role of the generalization behavior of the substitute classifier used for generating adversarial examples in the transferability of the attack scheme to unobserved DNN classifiers. To do this, we apply the max-min adversarial example game framework and show the importance of the generalization properties of the substitute DNN from training to test data in the success of the black-box attack scheme in application to different DNN classifiers. We prove theoretical generalization bounds on the difference between the attack transferability rates on training and test samples. Our bounds suggest that operator norm-based regularization methods could improve the transferability of the designed adversarial examples. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments showing the role of the substitute network’s generalization in generating transferable adversarial examples.

    "title": "Bidirectional Attention as a Mixture of Continuous Word Experts",
    "abstract": "Bidirectional attention - composed of the neural network architecture of self-attention with positional encodings, together with the masked language model (MLM) objective - has emerged as a key component of modern large language models (LLMs). Despite its empirical success, few studies have examined its statistical underpinnings: What statistical model is bidirectional attention implicitly fitting? What sets it apart from its non-attention predecessors? We explore these questions in this paper. The key observation is that fitting a single-layer single-head bidirectional attention, upon reparameterization, is equivalent to fitting a continuous bag of words (CBOW) model with mixture-of-experts (MoE) weights. Further, bidirectional attention with multiple heads and multiple layers is equivalent to stacked MoEs and a mixture of MoEs, respectively. This statistical viewpoint reveals the distinct use of MoE in bidirectional attention, which aligns with its practical effectiveness in handling heterogeneous data. It also suggests an immediate extension to categorical tabular data, if we view each word location in a sentence as a tabular feature. Across empirical studies, we find that this extension outperforms existing tabular extensions of transformers in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Finally, this statistical perspective of bidirectional attention enables us to theoretically characterize when linear word analogies are present in its word embeddings. These analyses show that bidirectional attention can require much stronger assumptions to exhibit linear word analogies than its non-attention predecessors",

It is still an open question if one can achieve stronger performance guarantees, i.e., the uniform probably approximate correctness (Uniform-PAC) guarantee that can imply both a sub-linear regret bound and a polynomial sample complexity for any target learning accuracy.  We study this problem by proposing algorithms for both nonlinear bandits and model-based episodic RL using the general function class with a bounded eluder dimension. The key idea of the proposed algorithms is to assign each action to different levels according to its width with respect to the confidence set. The achieved Uniform-PAC sample complexity is tight in the sense that it matches the state-of-the-art regret bounds or sample complexity guarantees when reduced to the linear case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for Uniform-PAC guarantees on bandit and RL that goes beyond linear cases",

This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of AIL in this context, where the stochastic and uncertain nature of environment transitions presents a challenge.  We examine the expert sample complexity and interaction complexity required to recover good policies.

In contrast to many existing methods that meet economic rationality constraints (e.g., non-arbitrage) by introducing auxiliary losses, our solution meets those constraints exactly by design. To achieve this, we propose to build a model for risk neutral density using normalizing flows, which results in a pricing model, instead of modelling the option pricing function directly. First, we convert the constraints for direct pricing models to the constraints for models backed by risk neutral density estimation, then we design a specific NF architecture that meets these constraints. Furthermore, we find that employing a mixture of such normalizing flows improves the performance significantly, compared to using a deeper single NF. Finally, we present a mechanism to regularise the proposed model, and this regularisation can serve as a bridge between our method and any sample-based mathematical finance method.

Here, we propose a multi-modal unsupervised feature selection framework: identifying informative variables based on coupled high-dimensional measurements.

In this paper, we show that this approach can be adapted to cases where only a generative model (a simulator) of the Dec-POMDP is available. This requires relying on a simulation-based POMDP solver to construct an agent’s FSC node by node. A related process is used to heuristically derive initial FSCs.

Finally, each agent applies its local information to anticipate the teammates’ context for decision-making accordingly.

We argue that existing SSL approaches for graphs have two limitations. First, they rely on corruption techniques such as node attribute perturbation and edge dropping to generate graph views for contrastive learning. These unnatural corruption techniques require extensive tuning efforts and provide marginal improvements. Second, the current approaches require the computation of multiple graph views, which is memory and computationally inefficient. These shortcomings of graph SSL call for a corruption-free single-view learning approach, but the strawman approach of using neighboring nodes as positive examples suffers two problems: it ignores the strength of connections between nodes implied by the graph structure on a macro level, and cannot deal with the high noise in real-world graphs. We propose Proximity Divergence Minimization (PDM), a corruption-free single-view graph SSL approach that overcomes these problems by leveraging node proximity to measure connection strength and denoise the graph structure. Through extensive experiments, we show that PDM achieves up to 4.55% absolute improvement in ROC-AUC on graph SSL tasks over state-of-the-art approaches while being more memory efficient.

In this work, we propose an exploration method that effectively encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of sequential action-computation scheme.

Assuming agents compute actions following a sequential order at each environment timestep, we provide a perspective to view MARL as tree search iterations by considering agents as nodes at different depths of the search tree. Inspired by the theoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees), we develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic Exploration (COE). COE augments each agent’s state-action value estimate with an action-conditioned optimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the global state and joint actions of preceding agents. COE is performed during training and disabled at deployment, making it compatible with any value decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution.

However, their application in real-world scenarios presents challenges due to their sensitivity to visual distractions (e.g., changes in viewpoint and light). A key factor contributing to this challenge is that the learned representations often suffer from overfitting task-irrelevant information. By comparing several representation learning methods, we find that the key to alleviating overfitting in representation learning is to choose proper prediction targets. Motivated by our comparison, we propose a novel representation learning approach—namely, reward sequence prediction (RSP)—that uses reward sequences or their transforms (e.g., discrete time Fourier transform) as prediction targets. RSP can efficiently learn robust representations as reward sequences rarely contain task-irrelevant information while providing a large number of supervised signals to accelerate representation learning. An appealing feature is that RSP makes no assumption about the type of distractions and thus can improve performance even when multiple types of distractions exist.

    "title": "AUC Maximization in Imbalanced Lifelong Learning",
    "abstract": "Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in machine learning, such as medical or fine-grained image datasets. The existing continual learning methods employ various techniques such as balanced sampling to improve classification accuracy in this setting. However, classification accuracy is not a suitable metric for imbalanced data, and hence these methods may not obtain a good classifier as measured by other metrics (e.g., Area under the ROC Curve). In this paper, we propose a solution to enable efficient imbalanced continual learning by designing an algorithm to effectively maximize one widely used metric in an imbalanced data setting: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). We find that simply replacing accuracy with AUC will cause gradient interference problem due to the imbalanced data distribution. To address this issue, we propose a new algorithm, namely DIANA, which performs a novel synthesis of model DecouplIng ANd Alignment. In particular, the algorithm updates two models simultaneously: one focuses on learning the current knowledge while the other concentrates on reviewing previously-learned knowledge, and the two models gradually align during training. The results show that the proposed DIANA achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the imbalanced datasets compared with several competitive baselines",

    "title": "Private Prediction Strikes Back! Private Kernelized Nearest Neighbors with Individual Rényi Filter",
    "abstract": "Most existing approaches of differentially private (DP) machine learning focus on private training.  Despite its many advantages, private training lacks the flexibility in adapting to incremental changes to the training dataset such as deletion requests from exercising GDPR’s right to be forgotten. We revisit a long-forgotten alternative, known as private prediction, and propose a new algorithm named Individual Kernelized Nearest Neighbor (Ind-KNN). Ind-KNN is easily updatable over dataset changes and it allows precise control of the Rényi DP at an individual user level — a user’s privacy loss is measured by the exact amount of her contribution to predictions; and a user is removed if her prescribed privacy budget runs out. Our results show that Ind-KNN consistently improves the accuracy over existing private prediction methods for a wide range of epsilon on four vision and language tasks. We also illustrate several cases under which Ind-KNN is preferable over private training with NoisySGD",

    "title": "MixupE: Understanding and improving Mixup from directional derivative perspective",
    "abstract": "Mixup is a popular data augmentation technique for training deep neural networks where additional samples are generated by linearly interpolating pairs of inputs and their labels. This technique is known to improve the generalization performance in many learning paradigms and applications. In this work, we first analyze Mixup and show that it implicitly regularizes infinitely many directional derivatives of all orders. Based on this new insight, we propose an improved version of Mixup, theoretically justified to deliver better generalization performance than the vanilla Mixup. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments across various domains such as images, tabular data, speech, and graphs. Our results show that the proposed method improves Mixup across multiple datasets using a variety of architectures, for instance, exhibiting an improvement over Mixup by 0.8% in ImageNet top-1 accuracy",

    "title": "Regularized online DR-submodular optimization",
    "abstract": "The utilization of online optimization techniques is prevalent in many fields of artificial intelligence, enabling systems to continuously learn and adjust to their surroundings. This paper outlines a regularized online optimization problem, where the regularizer is defined on the average of the actions taken. The objective is to maximize  the sum of rewards and the regularizer value while adhering to resource constraints, where the reward function is assumed to be DR-submodular. Both concave and DR-submodular regularizers are analyzed. Concave functions are useful in describing the impartiality of decisions, while DR-submodular functions can be employed to represent the overall effect of decisions on all relevant parties. We have developed two algorithms for each of the concave and DR-submodular regularizers. These algorithms are easy to implement, efficient, and produce sublinear regret in both cases. The performance of the proposed algorithms and regularizers has been verified through numerical experiments in the context of internet advertising",
