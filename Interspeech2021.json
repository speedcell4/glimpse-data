    "title": "Conversion of Airborne to Bone-Conducted Speech with Deep Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is a common experience of most speakers that the playback of one's own voice sounds strange. This can be mainly attributed to the missing bone-conducted speech signal that is not present in the playback signal. It was also shown that some phonemes have a high bone-conducted relative to air-conducted sound transmission, which means that the bone-conduction filter is phone-dependent. To achieve such a phone-dependent modeling we train different speaker dependent and speaker adaptive speech conversion systems using airborne and bone-conducted speech data from 8 speakers (5 male, 3 female), which allow for the conversion of airborne speech to bone-conducted speech. The systems are based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural networks, where the speaker adaptive versions with speaker embedding can be used without bone-conduction signals from the target speaker. Additionally we also used models that apply a global filtering. The different models are then evaluated by an objective error metric and a subjective listening experiment, which show that the LSTM based models outperform the global filters",

In this paper, we, therefore, introduce a T5G2P model, a Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) neural network model which is able to convert an input text sentence into a phoneme sequence with a high accuracy. The evaluation of our trained T5 model is carried out on English and Czech, since there are different specific properties of G2P, including homograph disambiguation, cross-word assimilation and irregular pronunciation of loanwords. The paper also contains an analysis of a homographs issue in English and offers another approach to Czech phonetic transcription using the detection of pronunciation exceptions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural vocoders are systematically evaluated on homogeneous train and test databases. This kind of evaluation is efficient to compare neural vocoders in their \"comfort zone\", yet it hardly reveals their limits towards unseen data during training. To compare their extrapolation capabilities, we introduce a methodology that aims at quantifying the robustness of neural vocoders in synthesising unseen data, by precisely controlling the ranges of seen/unseen data in the training database. By focusing in this study on the pitch (F ) parameter, our methodology involves a careful splitting of a dataset to control which F values are seen/unseen during training, followed by both global (utterance) and local (frame) evaluation of vocoders. Comparison of four types of vocoders (autoregressive, sourcefilter, flows, GAN) displays a wide range of behaviour towards unseen input pitch values, including excellent extrapolation (WaveGlow); widely-spread F errors (WaveRNN); and systematic generation of the training set median F (LPCNet, Parallel WaveGAN). In contrast, fewer differences between vocoders were observed when using homogeneous train and test sets, thus demonstrating the potential and need for such evaluation to better discriminate the neural vocoders abilities to generate out-of-training-range data",

To investigate the difference in output quality between corresponding monolingual and multilingual models, we propose a novel measure to compare this difference across the included studies and their various evaluation metrics. This measure, called the Multilingual Model Effect (MLME), is found to be affected by: acoustic model architecture, the difference ratio of target language data between corresponding multilingual and monolingual experiments, the balance ratio of target language data to total data, and the amount of target language data used. These findings can act as reference for data strategies in future experiments with multilingual TTS models for LRLs.

There is a need to better understand the long-term effects of a TBI for objective tracking of an individual's recovery, which could be used to determine intervention trajectories. This study utilizes acoustic features derived from recordings of speech tasks completed by active-duty service members and veterans (SMVs) enrolled in the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury (DVBIC)/Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence (TBICoE) 15-Year Longitudinal TBI Study. We hypothesize that the individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe TBI would demonstrate motor speech impairments through decreased coordination of the speech production subsystems as compared to individuals with no history of TBI. Speech motor coordination is measured through correlations of acoustic feature time series representing speech subsystems. Eigenspectra derived from these correlations are utilized in machine learning models to discriminate between the two groups. The fusion of correlation features derived from the recordings achieves an AUC of 0.78. This suggests that residual motor impairments from moderate to severe TBI could be detectable through objective measures of speech motor coordination",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease produces several motor symptoms, including different speech impairments that are known as hypokinetic dysarthria. Symptoms associated to dysarthria affect different dimensions of speech such as phonation, articulation, prosody, and intelligibility. Studies in the literature have mainly focused on the analysis of articulation and prosody because they seem to be the most prominent symptoms associated to dysarthria severity. However, phonation impairments also play a significant role to evaluate the global speech severity of Parkinson's patients. This paper proposes an extensive comparison of different methods to automatically evaluate the severity of specific phonation impairments in Parkinson's patients. The considered models include the computation of perturbation and glottal-based features, in addition to features extracted from a zero frequency filtered signals. We consider as well end-to-end models based on 1D CNNs, which are trained to learn features from the raw speech waveform, reconstructed glottal signals, and zero-frequency filtered signals. The results indicate that it is possible to automatically classify between speakers with low versus high phonation severity due to the presence of dysarthria and at the same time to evaluate the severity of the phonation impairments on a continuous scale, posed as a regression problem",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variant of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA-P) are two neurodegenerative diseases which share similar clinical features, particularly in early disease stages. The differential diagnosis can be thus very challenging. Dysarthria is known to be a frequent and early clinical feature of PD and MSA. It can be thus used as a vehicle to provide a vocal biomarker which could help in the differential diagnosis. In particular, distortion of consonants is known to be a frequent impairment in these diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate distinctive patterns in the distortion of voiced obstruents (plosives and fricatives). It is the first study which attempts to examine such distortions in the French language for the purpose of the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA-P (and among the very few studies if we consider all languages). We carry out a perceptual and objective analysis of voiced obstruents extracted from isolated pseudo-words initials. We first show that devoicing is a significant impairment which predominates in MSA-P. We then show that voice onset time (VOT) of voiced plosives (prevoicing duration) can be a complementary feature to improve the accuracy in discrimination between PD and MSA-P",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding (SLU) systems avoid an intermediate textual representation by mapping speech directly into intents with slot values. This approach requires considerable domain-specific training data. In low-resource scenarios this is a major concern, e.g., in the present study dealing with SLU for dysarthric speech. Pretraining part of the SLU model for automatic speech recognition targets helps but no research has shown to which extent SLU on dysarthric speech benefits from knowledge transferred from other dysarthric speech tasks. This paper investigates the efficiency of pre-training strategies for SLU tasks on dysarthric speech. The designed SLU system consists of a TDNN acoustic model for feature encoding and a capsule network for intent and slot decoding. The acoustic model is pre-trained in two stages: initialization with a corpus of normal speech and finetuning on a mixture of dysarthric and normal speech. By introducing the intelligibility score as a metric of the impairment severity, this paper quantitatively analyzes the relation between generalization and pathology severity for dysarthric speech",

The dataset consists of 21386 audio recordings from 24 healthy and 31 dysarthric speakers, whose individual degree of speech impairment was assessed by neurologists through the Therapy Outcome Measure. The corpus aims at providing a resource for the development of ASR-based assistive technologies for patients with dysarthria. In particular, it may be exploited to develop a voice-controlled contact application for commercial smartphones, aiming at improving dysarthric patients' ability to communicate with their family and caregivers. Before recording the dataset, participants were administered a survey to evaluate which commands are more likely to be employed by dysarthric individuals in a voice-controlled contact application. In addition, the dataset includes a list of non-commands (i.e., words near/inside commands or phonetically close to commands) that can be leveraged to build a more robust command recognition system. At present commercial ASR systems perform poorly on the EasyCall Corpus as we report in this paper. This result corroborates the need for dysarthric speech corpora for developing effective assistive technologies.

We recently performed a comprehensive review of those models and unified them into a general class called Dynamical Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs).

    "abstract": "Accurate phoneme detection and processing can enhance speech intelligibility in hearing aids and audio & speech codecs. As fricative phonemes have an important part of their energy concentrated in high frequency bands, frequency lowering algorithms are used in hearing aids to improve fricative intelligibility for people with high-frequency hearing loss. In traditional audio codecs, while processing speech in blocks, spectral smearing around fricative phoneme borders results in pre and post echo artifacts. Hence, detecting the fricative borders and adapting the processing accordingly could enhance the quality of speech. Until recently, phoneme detection and analysis were mostly done by extracting features specific to the class of phonemes. In this paper, we present a deep learning based fricative phoneme detection algorithm that exceeds the state-of-the-art fricative phoneme detection accuracy on the TIMIT speech corpus. Moreover, we compare our method to other approaches that employ classical signal processing for fricative detection and also evaluate it on the TIMIT files coded with AAC codec followed by bandwidth limitation. Reported results of our deep learning approach on original TIMIT files are reproducible and come with an easy to use code that could serve as a baseline for any future research on this topic",

    "abstract": "Mutual information (MI) is useful in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. Maximizing the MI between the low-level features and the learned embeddings can preserve meaningful information in the embeddings, which can contribute to performance gains. This strategy is called deep InfoMax (DIM) in representation learning. In this paper, we follow the DIM framework so that the speaker embeddings can capture more information from the frame-level features. However, a straightforward implementation of DIM may pose a dimensionality imbalance problem because the dimensionality of the frame-level features is much larger than that of the speaker embeddings. This problem can lead to unreliable MI estimation and can even cause detrimental effects on speaker verification. To overcome this problem, we propose to squeeze the frame-level features before MI estimation through some global pooling methods. We call the proposed method squeeze-DIM. Although the squeeze operation inevitably introduces some information loss, we empirically show that the squeeze-DIM can achieve performance gains on both Voxceleb1 and VOiCES-19 tasks. This suggests that the squeeze operation facilitates the MI estimation and maximization in a balanced dimensional space, which helps learn more informative speaker embeddings",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a serialized multi-layer multi-head attention for neural speaker embedding in text-independent speaker verification. In prior works, frame-level features from one layer are aggregated to form an utterance-level representation. Inspired by the Transformer network, our proposed method utilizes the hierarchical architecture of stacked self-attention mechanisms to derive refined features that are more correlated with speakers. Serialized attention mechanism contains a stack of self-attention modules to create fixed-dimensional representations of speakers. Instead of utilizing multi-head attention in parallel, the proposed serialized multi-layer multi-head attention is designed to aggregate and propagate attentive statistics from one layer to the next in a serialized manner. In addition, we employ an input-aware query for each utterance with the statistics pooling. With more layers stacked, the neural network can learn more discriminative speaker embeddings. Experiment results on VoxCeleb1 dataset and SITW dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, including x-vectors and other x-vectors + conventional attentive pooling approaches by 9.7% in EER and 8.1% in DCF10 ",

    "abstract": "The combination of the recently proposed LPCNet vocoder and a seq-to-seq acoustic model, i.e., Tacotron, has successfully achieved lightweight speech synthesis systems. However, the quality of synthesized speech is often unstable because the precision of the pitch parameters predicted by acoustic models is insufficient, especially for some tonal languages like Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end speech synthesis system, TacoLPCNet, by conditioning LPCNet on Mel spectrogram predictions. First, we extend LPCNet for the Mel spectrogram instead of using explicit pitch information and pitch-related network. Furthermore, we optimize the system by model pruning, multi-frame inference, and increasing frame length, to enable it to meet the conditions required for real-time applications. The objective and subjective evaluation results for various languages show that the proposed system is more stable for tonal languages within the proposed optimization strategies. The experimental results also verify that our model improves synthesis runtime by 3.12 times than that of the baseline on a standard CPU while maintaining naturalness",

However, such DGP models consist of a pipeline architecture of independent models, acoustic and duration models, and require a high level of expertise in text processing. The proposed model is based on Seq2Seq learning, which enables a unified training of acoustic and duration models. The encoder and decoder layers are represented by Gaussian process regressions (GPRs) and the parameters are trained as a Bayesian model. We also propose a self-attention mechanism with Gaussian processes to effectively model character-level input in the encoder. The subjective evaluation results show that the proposed Seq2Seq-SA-DGP can synthesize more natural speech than DNNs with self-attention and recurrent structures.

    "abstract": "The biggest obstacle to develop end-to-end Japanese text-to-speech (TTS) systems is to estimate phonetic and prosodic information (PPI) from Japanese texts. The following are the reasons: (1) the Kanji characters of the Japanese writing system have multiple corresponding pronunciations, (2) there is no separation mark between words, and (3) an accent nucleus must be assigned at appropriate positions. In this paper, we propose to solve the problems by neural machine translation (NMT) on the basis of encoder-decoder models, and compare NMT models of recurrent neural networks and the Transformer architecture. The proposed model handles texts on token (character) basis, although conventional systems handle them on word basis. To ensure the potential of the proposed approach, NMT models are trained using pairs of sentences and their PPIs that are generated by a conventional Japanese TTS system from 5 million sentences. Evaluation experiments were performed using PPIs that are manually annotated for 5,142 sentences. The experimental results showed that the Transformer architecture has the best performance, with 98.0% accuracy for phonetic information estimation and 95.0% accuracy for PPI estimation.

    "abstract": "Expressive neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems incorporate a style encoder to learn a latent embedding as the style information. However, this embedding process may encode redundant textual information. This phenomenon is called content leakage. Researchers have attempted to resolve this problem by adding an ASR or other auxiliary supervision loss functions. In this study, we propose an unsupervised method called the \"information sieve\" to reduce the effect of content leakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that the style encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather than on textual information contained in the reference speech by a well-designed downsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style embeddings can be downsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled by duplication. Furthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution layers to help the system learn a better latent style space. Objective metrics such as the significantly lower word error rate (WER) demonstrate the effectiveness of this model in mitigating content leakage. Listening tests indicate that the model retains its prosody transferability compared with the baseline models such as the original GST-Tacotron and ASR-guided Tacotron",

These models are usually trained with teacher forcing, where the reference back-history is used to predict the next token. This makes training efficient, but limits performance, because during inference the free-running back-history must be used. To address this problem, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq has been used in NMT. Here the output sequence is generated in multiple passes, each one conditioned on the initial input and the free-running output of the previous pass. This paper investigates, and compares, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq for TTS and NMT. For NMT the simplest form of multi-pass approaches, where the free-running first-pass output is combined with the initial input, improves performance. However, applying this scheme to TTS is challenging: the multi-pass model tends to converge to the standard single-pass model, ignoring the previous output. To tackle this issue, a guided attention loss is added, enabling the system to make more extensive use of the free-running output.

    "abstract": "Transformer models have shown promising results in neural speech synthesis due to their superior ability to model long-term dependencies compared to recurrent networks. The computation complexity of transformers increases quadratically with sequence length, making it impractical for many real-time applications. To address the complexity issue in speech synthesis domain, this paper proposes an efficient transformer-based acoustic model that is constant-speed regardless of input sequence length, making it ideal for streaming speech synthesis applications. The proposed model uses a transformer network that predicts the prosody features at phone rate and then an Emformer network to predict the frame-rate spectral features in a streaming manner. Both the transformer and Emformer in the proposed architecture use a self-attention mechanism that involves explicit long-term information, thus providing improved speech naturalness for long utterances. In our experiments, we use a WaveRNN neural vocoder that takes in the predicted spectral features and generates the final audio. The overall architecture achieves human-like speech quality both on short and long utterances while maintaining a low latency and low real-time factor. Our mean opinion score (MOS) evaluation shows that for short utterances, the proposed model achieves a MOS of 4.213 compared to ground-truth with MOS of 4.307; and for long utterances, it also produces high-quality speech with a MOS of 4.201 compared to ground-truth with MOS of 4.360",

There are many ways to speed up training with minimal performance loss, such as training with more GPUs, or with mixed precisions, optimizing training parameters, or making features more compact but more representable. Since mini-batch training is now the go-to approach for many machine learning tasks, minimizing the zero-padding to incorporate samples of different lengths into one batch, is an alternative approach to save training time. Here we propose a batching strategy based on semi-sorted samples, with dynamic batch sizes and batch randomization. By replacing the random batching with the proposed batching strategies, it saves more than 40% training time without compromising performance in training seq2seq neural text-to-speech models based on the Tacotron framework. We also compare it with two other batching strategies and show it performs similarly in terms of saving time and maintaining performance, but with a simpler concept and a smoother tuning parameter to balance between zero-padding and randomness level",

The processed stimuli were presented to normal-hearing listeners to recognize. Results showed that, consistent with the segmental contributions in understanding uncompressed speech, the vowel-only time-compressed stimuli were highly intelligible (i.e., intelligibility score >85%) at a TCR around 3, and vowel-consonant transitions carried important intelligibility information in understanding time-compressed sentences. The time-compression conditions in the present work provided higher intelligibility scores than their counterparties in understanding the PSOLA-processed time-compressed sentences with TCRs around 3.

Although effective, CLPSO is computationally expensive to the extent that it overshadows its merits in intelligibility improvement. As a solution to this, the current work aims to improve the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) of (target) speech using a Delta Function that has been generated using a different (source) language.

Recently, neural network-based methods have been applied to speech enhancement. However, many neural network-based methods require users to collect clean speech and background noise for training, which can be time-consuming. In addition, speech enhancement systems trained on particular types of background noise may not generalize well to a wide range of noise. To tackle those problems, we propose a speech enhancement framework trained on weakly labelled data. We first apply a pretrained sound event detection system to detect anchor segments that contain sound events in audio clips. Then, we randomly mix two detected anchor segments as a mixture. We build a conditional source separation network using the mixture and a conditional vector as input. The conditional vector is obtained from the audio tagging predictions on the anchor segments. In inference, we input a noisy speech signal with the one-hot encoding of \"Speech\" as a condition to the trained system to predict enhanced speech.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For speech enhancement, deep complex network based methods have shown promising performance due to their effectiveness in dealing with complex-valued spectrums. Recent speech enhancement methods focus on further optimization of network structures and hyperparameters, however, ignore inherent speech characteristics (e.g., phonetic characteristics), which are important for networks to learn and reconstruct speech information. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based phone-fortified (SSPF) method for speech enhancement. Our method explicitly imports phonetic characteristics into a deep complex convolutional network via a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) model pre-trained with self-supervised learning. This operation can greatly improve speech representation learning and speech enhancement performance. Moreover, we also apply the self-attention mechanism to our model for learning long-range dependencies of a speech sequence, which further improves the performance of speech enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that our SSPF method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality and intelligibility",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Objective measures of success, such as the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), have recently been used to optimize deep-learning based speech enhancement algorithms, in an effort to incorporate perceptual constraints into the learning process. Optimizing with these measures, however, may be sub-optimal, since the objective scores do not always strongly correlate with a listener's evaluation. This motivates the need for approaches that either are optimized with scores that are strongly correlated with human assessments or that use alternative strategies for incorporating perceptual constraints. In this work, we propose an attention-based approach that uses learned speech embedding vectors from a mean-opinion score (MOS) prediction model and a speech enhancement module to jointly enhance noisy speech. Our loss function is jointly optimized with signal approximation and MOS prediction loss terms. We train the model using real-world noisy speech data that has been captured in everyday environments. The results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms other approaches that are optimized with objective measures",

    "abstract": "There are many deterministic mathematical operations (e.g. compression, clipping, downsampling) that degrade speech quality considerably. In this paper we introduce a neural network architecture, based on a modification of the DiffWave model, that aims to restore the original speech signal. DiffWave, a recently published diffusion-based vocoder, has shown state-of-the-art synthesized speech quality and relatively shorter waveform generation times, with only a small set of parameters. We replace the mel-spectrum upsampler in DiffWave with a deep CNN upsampler, which is trained to alter the degraded speech mel-spectrum to match that of the original speech. The model is trained using the original speech waveform, but conditioned on the degraded speech mel-spectrum. Post-training, only the degraded mel-spectrum is used as input and the model generates an estimate of the original speech. Our model results in improved speech quality (original DiffWave model as baseline) on several different experiments. These include improving the quality of speech degraded by LPC-10 compression, AMR-NB compression, and signal clipping. Compared to the original DiffWave architecture, our scheme achieves better performance on several objective perceptual metrics and in subjective comparisons. Improvements over baseline are further amplified in a out-of-corpus evaluation setting",

In human communication, we can recover from them by repeating misrecognized words or phrases; however in human-machine communication this recovery mechanism is not available. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and present a system that allows a user to correct speech recognition errors in a virtual assistant by repeating misunderstood words. When a user repeats part of the phrase the system rewrites the original query to incorporate the correction. This rewrite allows the virtual assistant to understand the original query successfully. We present an end-to-end 2-step attention pointer network that can generate the the rewritten query by merging together the incorrectly understood utterance with the correction follow-up. We evaluate the model on data collected for this task and compare the proposed model to a rule-based baseline and a standard pointer network. We show that rewriting the original query is an effective way to handle repetition-based recovery and that the proposed model outperforms the rule based baseline, reducing Word Error Rate by 19% relative at 2% False Alarm Rate on annotated data",

    "abstract": "As an essential component in task-oriented dialogue systems, dialogue state tracking (DST) aims to track human-machine interactions and generate state representations for managing the dialogue. Representations of dialogue states are dependent on the domain ontology and the user's goals. In several task-oriented dialogues with a limited scope of objectives, dialogue states can be represented as a set of slot-value pairs. As the capabilities of dialogue systems expand to support increasing naturalness in communication, incorporating dialogue act processing into dialogue model design becomes essential. The lack of such consideration limits the scalability of dialogue state tracking models for dialogues having specific objectives and ontology. To address this issue, we formulate and incorporate dialogue acts, and leverage recent advances in machine reading comprehension to predict both categorical and non-categorical types of slots for multi-domain dialogue state tracking.

Existing state-of-the-art few-shot model, Prototypical Network (PN), mainly focus on computing the similarity between examples in a metric space by leveraging sentence-level instance representations. However, sentence-level representations may incorporate highly noisy signals from unrelated words which leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Semantic Transportation Prototypical Network (STPN) to alleviate this issue. Different from the original PN, our approach takes word-level representation as input and uses a new distance metric to obtain better sample matching result. And we reformulate the few-shot classification task into an instance of optimal matching, in which the key word semantic information between examples are expected to be matched and the matching cost is treated as similarity. Specifically, we design Mutual-Semantic mechanism to generate word semantic information, which could reduce the unrelated word noise and enrich key word information. Then, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is applied to find an optimal matching solution.

Under such strong constraints, single-channel speech enhancement becomes a key technology because methods with multiple-passes or batch processing, such as acoustic model adaptation, are not suitable for use. However, single-channel speech enhancement often degrades ASR performance due to speech distortion. To overcome this problem, we propose a noise robust acoustic modeling method based on the stream-wise transformer model. The proposed method accepts multi-stream features obtained by multiple single-channel speech enhancement methods as input and selectively uses an appropriate feature stream according to the noise environment by paying attention to the noteworthy stream on the basis of multi-head attention. The proposed method considers the attention for the stream direction instead of the time series direction, and it is thus capable of real-time and low-latency processing. Comparative evaluations reveal that the proposed method successfully improves the accuracy of ASR in noisy environments and reduces the number of model parameters even under strong constraints",

It is known that channel selection is an important problem of ad-hoc microphone arrays, however, this topic seems far from explored in speech recognition yet, particularly with a large-scale ad-hoc microphone array. To address this problem, we propose a algorithm for the channel selection problem of the speech recognition with large-scale ad-hoc microphone arrays. Specifically, we first replace the conventional Softmax operator in the stream attention mechanism of a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition system with Sparsemax, which conducts channel selection by forcing the channel weights of noisy channels to zero. Because Sparsemax punishes the weights of many channels to zero harshly, we propose Scaling Sparsemax which punishes the channels mildly by setting the weights of very noisy channels to zero only. Experimental results with ad-hoc microphone arrays of over 30 channels under the conformer speech recognition architecture show that the proposed Scaling Sparsemax yields a word error rate of over 30% lower than Softmax on simulation data sets, and over 20% lower on semi-real data sets, in test scenarios with both matched and mismatched channel numbers",

Finally, compared with Conformer-based E2E baseline without mask training, our model demonstrates about 5.51% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on reading speech and 12.92% on spontaneous speech, respectively. The above approach has also been verified on test-set of open-source data THUYG-20, which shows 20% relative improvements",

    "abstract": "Is pushing numbers on a single benchmark valuable in automatic speech recognition? Research results in acoustic modeling are typically evaluated based on performance on a single dataset. While the research community has coalesced around various benchmarks, we set out to understand generalization performance in acoustic modeling across datasets — in particular, if models trained on a single dataset transfer to other (possibly out-of-domain) datasets. Further, we demonstrate that when a large enough set of benchmarks is used, average word error rate (WER) performance over them provides a good proxy for performance on real-world data. Finally, we show that training a single acoustic model on the most widely-used datasets — combined — reaches competitive performance on both research and real-world benchmarks",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech recognition generally uses hand-engineered acoustic features as input and excludes the feature extraction module from its joint optimization. To extract learnable and adaptive features and mitigate information loss, we propose a new encoder that adopts globally attentive locally recurrent (GALR) networks and directly takes raw waveform as input. We observe improved ASR performance and robustness by applying GALR on different window lengths to aggregate fine-grain temporal information into multi-scale acoustic features. Experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset and two large-scale Mandarin speech corpus of 5,000 hours and 21,000 hours. With faster speed and comparable model size, our proposed multi-scale GALR waveform encoder achieved consistent character error rate reductions (CERRs) from 7.9% to 28.1% relative over strong baselines, including Conformer and TDNN-Conformer. In particular, our approach demonstrated notable robustness than the traditional handcrafted features and outperformed the baseline MFCC-based TDNN-Conformer model by a 15.2% CERR on a music-mixed real-world speech test set",

To integrate information of audio and visual modalities, a multi-branch network is proposed to learn audio and image representations, and the representations are fused by attention based on semantic similarity to shape the acoustic representations through the probability of anchor vocalization.

To resolve this challenge, in this paper, we propose using multi-channel voice activity detection (VAD) to determine the speech segments of a target speaker while also referencing the output speech from the microphones attached to the other speakers in the group. The conducted evaluation experiments using the actual speech of middle school students during group work lessons showed that our proposed method significantly improves the frame error rate (38.7%) compared to that of the conventional technology, single-channel VAD (49.5%). In our view, conventional approaches, such as distributed microphone arrays and deep learning, are somewhat dependent on the temporal stationarity of the speakers' positions.

Next, to transfer the rich information in audio-based VAD (A-VAD) model trained with a massive audio-only dataset to AV-VAD model built with relatively limited multi-modal data, a cross-modal teacher-student learning framework is then proposed based on cross entropy with regulated KL-divergence. Finally, evaluated on an in-house dataset recorded in realistic conditions using standard VAD metrics, the proposed approach yields consistent and significant improvements over other state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "We present a novel personalized voice activity detection (PVAD) learning method that does not require enrollment data during training. PVAD is a task to detect the speech segments of a specific target speaker at the frame level using enrollment speech of the target speaker. Since PVAD must learn speakers' speech variations to clarify the boundary between speakers, studies on PVAD used large-scale datasets that contain many utterances for each speaker. However, the datasets to train a PVAD model are often limited because substantial cost is needed to prepare such a dataset. In addition, we cannot utilize the datasets used to train the standard VAD because they often lack speaker labels. To solve these problems, our key idea is to use one utterance as both a kind of enrollment speech and an input to the PVAD during training, which enables PVAD training without enrollment speech. In our proposed method, called enrollment-less training, we augment one utterance so as to create variability between the input and the enrollment speech while keeping the speaker identity, which avoids the mismatch between training and inference. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the method",

This study proposes a VAD model through the tandem connection of neural network-based noise separation and a VAD model. By training the two models simultaneously, the noise separation model is expected to be trained to consider the VAD results, and thus effective noise separation can be achieved. Moreover, the improved speech/noise separation model will improve the accuracy of the VAD model. In this research, we deal with real-live speeches from baseball games, which have a very poor signal-to-noise ratio.

With the growing number of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically incorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability of IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy However, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands which hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these limitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL, that incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of audio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the latency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease the storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile devices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to 78–92% and the storage requirements by 2–4 times without sacrificing its performance. FastICARL enables complete on-device IL, ensuring user privacy as the user data does not need to leave the device",

Recent attempts employ self-supervised training methods, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), where the next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks at the audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a segmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework that can model the signal structure at a higher level e.g. at the phoneme level. In this framework, a convolutional neural network learns frame-level representation from the raw waveform via noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). A differentiable boundary detector finds variable-length segments, which are then used to optimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn segment representations. The differentiable boundary detector allows us to train frame-level and segment-level encoders jointly. Typically, phoneme and word segmentation are treated as separate tasks. We unify them and experimentally show that our single model outperforms existing phoneme and word segmentation methods on TIMIT and Buckeye datasets. We analyze the impact of boundary threshold and when is the right time to include the segmental loss in the learning process",

PA thus belongs, like most dialects of Arabic, to true voicing languages, i.e., languages with a contrast between voicing lead and short lag VOT We furthermore tested whether the phoneme /b/, without voiceless counterpart /p/ in PA, has similar VOT values to /d, d /, which have voiceless counterparts /t, t /. Similarly, we compared /k/, without counterpart /g/ in the PA dialect we investigated, to /t, t /. For /b/ we found very similar VOT values to /d, d /, while for /k/ we found a difference to /t, t /, attributable to a general tendency of velars to have longer VOT than denti-alveolars.

In the present paper, DeepFormants is integrated into semi-automatic speaker recognition systems using long-term formant distributions and compared against systems using traditional linear predictive coding. The readiness of the tool is assessed on overall speaker recognition performance, measured using equal error rates (EER) and the log LR cost functions (C ). In high-quality conditions, DeepFormants outperforms the best performing LPC systems. Much poorer overall performance is found in channel mismatch conditions for DeepFormants, suggesting it is not adaptable to conditions it was not originally trained on. However, this is also true of LPC methods, raising questions over the validity of using formant analysis at all in such cases. A major benefit of DeepFormants over LPC is that the analyst does not need to specify settings. We discuss the implications of this with regard to results for individual speakers",

In a second series of tests the duration of formant input in the compared files was reduced from 10 seconds to 5 and then to 2.5. All tests were performed both without and with the use of MAP adaptation. Results were evaluated in terms of overall performance characteristics EER and Cllr and in terms of score distributions visualized as Tippett plots. The main goal of the study was to compare the use and non-use of MAP and to look at the practical forensic implications of the difference. Results show that in terms of overall performance characteristics there is little difference between the selection and de-selection of MAP. Tippett plot patterns however reveal strong differences. Application of MAP allows for more symmetric same- and different-speaker distributions and shows more robustness against duration reductions, both of which are forensically important",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study considers issues of language- and speaker-specificity in long-term formant distributions (LTFDs) from phonetic and forensic perspectives and examines their potential value in cases of cross-language forensic voice comparison. Acoustic analysis of 60 male English–French bilinguals revealed systematic differences in LTFDs between the two languages, with higher LTF2–4 in French than in English. Cross-linguistic differences in the shapes of LTFDs were also found. These differences are argued to reflect not only vowel inventories of each language but also language-specific phonetic settings. At the same time, a high degree of within-speaker consistency was found across languages. Likelihood ratio based testing was carried out to examine the effect of language mismatch on the utility of LTFDs as speaker discriminants. Results showed that while the performance of LTFDs was worse in cross-language comparisons than in same-language comparisons, they were still capable of providing speaker-specific information. These findings demonstrate that, in spite of deteriorated performance, LTFDs are still potentially useful speaker discriminants in cases of language mismatch. These findings thus call for further empirical investigation into the use of linguistic-phonetic features in cross-language comparisons",

This project aims to describe the status of /n/ and /l/ in bilingual Cantonese and English speech to better understand individual differences at the interface of crosslinguistic influence and sound change. We examine bilingual speech using the SpiCE corpus, composed of speech from 34 early Cantonese-English bilinguals. Acoustic measures were collected on pre-vocalic nasal and lateral onsets in both languages. If bilinguals maintain separate representations for corresponding segments across languages, smaller differences between /n/ and /l/ are predicted in Cantonese compared to English. Measures of mid-frequency spectral tilt suggest that the /n/ and /l/ contrast is robustly maintained in English, but not Cantonese. The spacing of F2-F1 suggests small differences between Cantonese /n/ and /l/, and robust differences in English. While cross-language categories appear independent, substantial individual differences exist in the data. These data contribute to the understanding of the /n/ and /l/ merger in Cantonese and other Chinese languages, in addition to providing empirical and theoretical insights into crosslinguistic influence in early bilinguals",

A calibrated decision-level fusion system provides the final classification of coughs recordings as either COVID-19 positive or negative.

Distinct patterns were found in the embeddings of phonetic classes that have their place of articulation deep inside the vocal tract. We observed profound differences in classification results for development and test splits, similar to the baseline method We concluded that, based on our phonetic findings, it was safe to assume that our classifier was able to reliably detect a pathological condition located in the respiratory tract.

Deep speaker embeddings are normally trained discriminatively, predicting speaker identity labels on the training data. We hypothesise that additionally predicting speaker-related auxiliary variables — such as age and nationality — may yield representations that are better able to generalise to unseen speakers. We propose a framework for making use of auxiliary label information, even when it is only available for speech corpora mismatched to the target application. On a test set of US Supreme Court recordings, we show that by leveraging two additional forms of speaker attribute information derived respectively from the matched training data, and VoxCeleb corpus, we improve the performance of our deep speaker embeddings for both verification and diarization tasks, achieving a relative improvement of 26.2% in DER and 6.7% in EER compared to baselines using speaker labels only.

Parametric real-valued filters in the first convolutional layer are learned to transform the waveform into time-frequency representations. However, these methods only focus on the magnitude spectrum and the poor interpretability of the learned filters limits the performance. In this paper, we propose a complex speaker embedding extractor, named ICSpk, with higher interpretability and fewer parameters. Specifically, at first, to quantify the speaker-related frequency response of waveform, we modify the original short-term Fourier transform filters into a family of complex exponential filters, named interpretable complex (IC) filters. Each IC filter is confined by a complex exponential filter parameterized by frequency. Then, a deep complex-valued speaker embedding extractor is designed to operate on the complex-valued output of IC filters. The proposed ICSpk is evaluated on VoxCeleb and CNCeleb databases. Experimental results demonstrate the IC filters-based system exhibits a significant improvement over the complex spectrogram based systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces an interface that enables the real-time gestural control of intonation in phrases produced by a vocal synthesizer. The melody and timing of a target phrase can be modified by tracing melodic contours on the touch-screen of a mobile tablet. Envisioning this interface as a means for non-native speakers to practice the intonation of a foreign language, we present a pilot study where native and non-native speakers imitated the pronunciation of French phrases using their voice and the interface, with a visual guide and without. Comparison of resulting F0 curves against the reference contour and a preliminary perceptual assessment of synthesized utterances suggest that for both non-native and native speakers, imitation with the help of a visual guide is comparable in accuracy to vocal imitation, and that timing control was a source of difficulty",

    "abstract": "The current study explores whether perception of coarticulatory vowel nasalization differs by speaker age (adult vs. child) and type of voice (naturally produced vs. synthetic speech). Listeners completed a 4IAX discrimination task between pairs containing acoustically identical (both nasal or oral) vowels and acoustically distinct (one oral, one nasal) vowels. Vowels occurred in either the same consonant contexts or different contexts across pairs. Listeners completed the experiment with either naturally produced speech or text-to-speech (TTS). For same-context trials, listeners were better at discriminating between oral and nasal vowels for child speech in the synthetic voices but adult speech in the natural voices. Meanwhile, in different-context trials, listeners were less able to discriminate, indicating more perceptual compensation for synthetic voices. There was no difference in different-context discrimination across talker ages, indicating that listeners did not compensate differently if the speaker was a child or adult. Findings are relevant for models of compensation, computer personification theories, and speaker-indexical perception accounts",

    "abstract": "Decoding the speech signal that a person is listening to from the human brain via electroencephalography (EEG) can help us understand how our auditory system works. Linear models have been used to reconstruct the EEG from speech or vice versa. Recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based architectures have outperformed linear models in modeling the relation between EEG and speech. Before attempting to use these models in real-world applications such as hearing tests or (second) language comprehension assessment we need to know what level of speech information is being utilized by these models. In this study, we aim to analyze the performance of an LSTM-based model using different levels of speech features. The task of the model is to determine which of two given speech segments is matched with the recorded EEG. We used low- and high-level speech features including: envelope, mel spectrogram, voice activity, phoneme identity, and word embedding. Our results suggest that the model exploits information about silences, intensity, and broad phonetic classes from the EEG. Furthermore, the mel spectrogram, which contains all this information, yields the highest accuracy (84%) among all the features",

    "abstract": "We discuss the role of entropy of the set of unfolding word candidates in the context of DIANA, a computational model of human auditory speech comprehension. DIANA consists of three major interacting components: Activation, Decision and Execution. The Activation component computes activations of word candidates that change over time as a function of the unfolding audio input. The resulting set of word candidate activations can be associated with an entropy that is related to difficulty of the decision when one of these candidates must be selected at time T. The paper presents the close relation between entropy measures and the between-word competition during the unfolding of the auditory stimuli, and at the end of the stimuli if no decision could be made before stimulus offset. We present a way for computing the entropy that takes into account linguistic-phonetic constraints that play a role in speech comprehension and in lexical decision experiments. Using the BALDEY data set and linear mixed effects regression models for RT, we show that entropy measures explain differences between RTs of words with different morphological structure",

In this analysis, RTs are considered a by-product of an (unobservable) cumulative incidence function that results in a decision when it exceeds a certain threshold We show that Survival Analysis can be effectively used to narrow the gap between data-oriented models and process-oriented models for RT data from lexical decision experiments.

In a large body of literature, RTs are measured from the onset of the stimulus to the start of the response (often a button press or an oral response). The rationale behind this choice is that information about the stimulus becomes available to the listener starting at onset. Alternatively, the RT from offset is less dependent on stimulus duration and is assumed to focus on those cognitive processes that play a role late(r) in the word and after word offset, when all information is available The paper presents RT-onset and RT-offset-based linear mixed effects models for three different lexical decision-based data sets and explains the significant differences between these models, showing to what extent both definitions of reaction time reveal different roles for predictors and how early and later contributions to the overall RT can be differentiated",

Different from other popular data augmentation methods such as SpecAugment and mixup that only work on the input space, SpecAugment++ is applied to both the input space and the hidden space of the deep neural networks to enhance the input and the intermediate feature representations. For an intermediate hidden state, the augmentation techniques consist of masking blocks of frequency channels and masking blocks of time frames, which improve generalization by enabling a model to attend not only to the most discriminative parts of the feature, but also the entire parts. Apart from using zeros for masking, we also examine two approaches for masking based on the use of other samples within the mini-batch, which helps introduce noises to the networks to make them more discriminative for classification. The experimental results on the DCASE 2018 Task1 dataset and DCASE 2019 Task1 dataset show that our proposed method can obtain 3.6% and 4.7% accuracy gains over a strong baseline without augmentation (i.e. CP-ResNet) respectively, and outperforms other previous data augmentation methods",

Existing methods simply treat the synthetic data as strongly-labeled data in semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Benefiting from the strong labels of synthetic data, superior SED performance can be achieved. However, a distribution mismatch between synthetic and real data raises an evident challenge for domain adaptation (DA). In MMT-DA, convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) learned from different datasets (i.e :real+synthetic, and ) are exploited for DA. Specifically, mean teacher method using CRNN is employed for utilizing the unlabeled real data. To compensate the domain diversity, an additional domain classifier with gradient reverse layer(GRL) is used for training a mean teacher for The student CRNNs are mutually taught using the soft predictions of unlabeled data obtained from different teachers. Furthermore, a strip pooling based attention module is exploited to model the inter-dependencies between channels and time-frequency dimensions to exploit the structure information.

The current state-of-the-art approaches to SED employ a shared attention mechanism achieved through a stack of MHSA blocks to detect multiple sound events. Consequently, in a multi-label SED task, a common attention mechanism would be responsible for generating relevant feature representations for each of the events to be detected. In this paper, we show through empirical evaluation that having more MHSA blocks dedicated specifically for individual events, rather than having a stack of shared MHSA blocks, improves the overall detection performance. Interestingly, this improvement in performance comes about because the event-specific attention blocks help in resolving confusions in the case of co-occurring events. The proposed \"Event-specific Attention Network\" (ESA-Net) can be trained in an end-to-end manner. On the DCASE 2020 Task 4 data set, we show that with ESA-Net, the best single model achieves an event-based F1 score of 52.1% on the public validation data set improving over the existing state of the art result",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit good performance in low-complexity classification with fixed-length acoustic scenes. However, previous studies have not considered variable-length acoustic scenes in which performance degradation is prevalent. In this regard, we investigate two novel architectures — convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer) and differentiable neural computer (DNC). Both the models show desirable performance for variable-length data but require a large amount of data. In other words, small amounts of data, such as those from acoustic scenes, lead to overfitting in these models. In this paper, we propose a shallow convolution-augmented Transformer with a differentiable neural computer (shallow Conformer-DNC) for the low-complexity classification of variable-length acoustic scenes. The shallow Conformer-DNC is enabled to converge with small amounts of data. Short-term and long-term contexts of variable-length acoustic scenes are trained by using the shallow Conformer and shallow DNC, respectively. The experiments were conducted for variable-length conditions using the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset. As a result, a peak accuracy of 61.25% was confirmed for shallow Conformer-DNC with a model parameter of 34 K. It is comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNNs",

    "abstract": "Video captioning is an essential technology to understand scenes and describe events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality, but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual Transformer is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two Transformers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames from the beginning",

    "abstract": "For patients suffering with high-frequency hearing loss and preserving low-frequency hearing, combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) may significantly improve their speech perception compared with cochlear implants (CIs). In combined EAS, a hearing aid provides low-frequency information via acoustic (A) stimulation and a CI evokes high-frequency sound sensation via electrical (E) stimulation. The present work investigated the EAS advantage when only a small number (i.e., 1 or 2) of channels were provided for electrical stimulation in a CI, and the effect of carrier bandwidth on understanding Mandarin sentences in a simulation of combined EAS experiment. The A-portion was extracted via low-pass filtering processing and the E-portion was generated with a vocoder model preserving multi-channel temporal envelope waveforms, whereas a noise-vocoder and a tone-vocoder were used to simulate the effect of carrier bandwidth. The synthesized stimuli were presented to normal-hearing listeners to recognize. Experimental results showed that while low-pass filtered Mandarin speech was not very intelligible, adding one or two E channels could significantly improve the intelligibility score to above 86.0%. Under the condition with one E channel, using a large carrier bandwidth in noise-vocoder processing provided a better intelligibility performance than using a narrow carrier bandwidth in tone-vocoder processing",

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) signals have been extensively used to capture facial muscle movements while speaking since they are one of the most closely related bio-signals generated during speech production. In this work, we focus on speech acoustics to EMG prediction. We present a comparative study of ten different EMG signal-based features including Time Domain (TD) features existing in the literature to examine their effectiveness in speech acoustics to EMG inverse (AEI) mapping. We propose a novel feature based on the Hilbert envelope of the filtered EMG signal. The raw EMG signal is reconstructed from these features as well. For the AEI mapping, we use a bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network in a session-dependent manner. To estimate the raw EMG signal from the EMG features, we use a CNN-BLSTM model comprising of a convolution neural network (CNN) followed by BLSTM layers. AEI mapping performance using the BLSTM network reveals that the Hilbert envelope based feature is predicted from speech with the highest accuracy, among all the features. Therefore, it could be the most representative feature of the underlying muscle activation during speech production. The proposed Hilbert envelope feature, when used together with the existing TD features, improves the raw EMG signal reconstruction performance compared to using the TD features alone",

A robotic simulation is being developed to facilitate Speech Language Pathologists to demonstrate the movement of jaw, tongue and teeth during production of speech sounds, as a part of a larger study. Profiling of jaw movement is an important aspect of articulatory simulation. The present study attempts to develop a simple and efficient technique for deriving the jaw parameters and using them to simulate jaw movements through inverse kinematics Three Kannada speaking male participants in the age range of 26 to 33 years were instructed to produce selected speech sounds. The image of the final position of the jaw during production of each speech sound was recorded through CT scan and video camera. Angle of ramus and angle of body of mandible were simulated through inverse kinematics using RoboAnalyzer software. The variables for inverse kinematics were derived through kinematic analysis. The Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters required for kinematic analysis were obtained from still image. Angles simulated were compared with the angles obtained from CT scan images. No significant difference was observed",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system for deaf people or hearing impaired people, in which a speaker uses it to aid a lipreader in phonetic level by clarifying potentially ambiguous mouth movements with hand shape and positions. Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS recognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS data annotations especially for hand shape modality. In this work, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn the feature representation of image without using labels. Secondly, a small amount of manually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we present a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further learn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to enlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we build a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation results on both French and British English datasets show that our model achieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements of 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art",

For this to be realised, the acceptability of remote speech collection to the user must be established, in addition to feasibility from an analytical perspective. To understand the acceptance, facilitators, and barriers of smartphone-based speech recording, we invited 384 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) from the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse — Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) research programme in Spain and the UK to complete a survey on their experiences recording their speech. In this analysis, we demonstrate that study participants were more comfortable completing a scripted speech task than a free speech task. For both speech tasks, we found depression severity and country to be significant predictors of comfort. Not seeing smartphone notifications of the scheduled speech tasks, low mood and forgetfulness were the most commonly reported obstacles to providing speech recordings",

The usefulness of ultrasound for biofeedback speech therapy is limited because speakers must mentally track and compare differences between their tongue movement and available models. It is desirable to automate this interpretive task using a single parameter representing deviation from known accurate tongue movements. In this study, displacements recorded automatically by ultrasound image tracking were transformed into a single biofeedback parameter (time-dependent difference between blade and dorsum displacements). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate this parameter as a predictor of production accuracy over a range of different vowel contexts with initial and final /r/ in American English. Areas under ROC curves were 0.8 or above, indicating that this simple parameter may provide useful real-time biofeedback on /r/ accuracy within a range of rhotic contexts",

We train our systems on imaging data from modal speech, and evaluate on matched test sets of two speaking modes: silent and modal speech. We observe that silent speech recognition from imaging data underperforms compared to modal speech recognition, likely due to a speaking-mode mismatch between training and testing. We improve silent speech recognition performance using techniques that address the domain mismatch, such as fMLLR and unsupervised model adaptation. We also analyse the properties of silent and modal speech in terms of utterance duration and the size of the articulatory space. To estimate the articulatory space, we compute the convex hull of tongue splines, extracted from ultrasound tongue images. Overall, we observe that the duration of silent speech is longer than that of modal speech, and that silent speech covers a smaller articulatory space than modal speech. Although these two properties are statistically significant across speaking modes, they do not directly correlate with word error rates from speech recognition",

    "abstract": "Speech is our most natural and efficient way of communication and offers a strong potential to improve how we interact with machines. However, speech communication can sometimes be limited by environmental (e.g., ambient noise), contextual (e.g., need for privacy in a public place), or health conditions (e.g., laryngectomy), hindering the consideration of audible speech. In this regard, silent speech interfaces (SSI) have been proposed (e.g., considering video, electromyography), however, many technologies still face limitations regarding their everyday use, e.g., the need to place equipment in contact with the speaker (e.g., electrodes/ultrasound probe), and raise technical (e.g., lighting conditions for video) or privacy concerns. In this context, the consideration of technologies that can help tackle these issues, e.g, by being contactless and/or placed in the environment, can foster the widespread use of SSI. In this article, continuous-wave radar is explored to assess its potential for SSI. To this end, a corpus of 13 words was acquired, for 3 speakers, and different classifiers were tested on the resulting data. The best results, obtained using Bagging classifier, trained for each speaker, with 5-fold cross-validation, yielded an average accuracy of 0.826, an encouraging result that establishes promising grounds for further exploration of this technology for silent speech recognition",

Although significant progress has been made, most of the recent SSI works focused on data collected from healthy speakers. SSIs for laryngectomees have rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigated the reconstruction of speech for two laryngectomees who either use tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) or electro-larynx (EL) speech as their post-surgery communication mode. We reconstructed their speech using two SSI designs (1) real-time recognition-and-synthesis and (2) directly articulation-to-speech synthesis (ATS). The reconstructed speech samples were measured in subjective evaluation by 20 listeners in terms of naturalness and intelligibility. The results indicated that both designs increased the naturalness of alaryngeal speech. The real-time recognition-and-synthesis design obtained higher intelligibility in electrolarynx speech as well, while the ATS did not. These preliminary results suggest the real-time recognition-and-synthesis design may have a better potential for clinical applications (for laryngectomees) than ATS",

    "abstract": "Fundamental frequency (f ) estimation, also known as pitch tracking, has been a long-standing research topic in the speech and signal processing community. Many pitch estimation algorithms, however, fail in noisy conditions or introduce large delays due to their frame size or Viterbi decoding In this study, we propose a deep learning-based pitch estimation algorithm, LACOPE, which was trained in a joint pitch estimation and speech enhancement framework. In contrast to previous work, this algorithm allows for a configurable latency down to an algorithmic delay of 0. This is achieved by exploiting the smoothness properties of the pitch trajectory. That is, a recurrent neural network compensates delay introduced by the feature computation by predicting the pitch for a desired point, allowing a trade-off between pitch accuracy and latency We integrate the pitch estimation in a speech enhancement framework for hearing aids. For this application, we allow a delay on the analysis side of approx. 5ms. The pitch estimate is then used for constructing a comb filter in frequency domain as post-processing step to remove intra-harmonic noise Our pitch estimation performance is on par with SOTA algorithms like PYIN or CREPE for spoken speech in all noise conditions while introducing minimal latency",

The state-of-the-art versatile blind source separation method called FastMNMF that assumes the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients of a direct sound to follow a circular complex Gaussian distribution with jointly-diagonalizable full-rank spatial covariance matrices was extended to AR-FastMNMF with an autoregressive reverberation model. Instead of the light-tailed Gaussian distribution, we use the heavy-tailed α-stable distribution, which also has the reproductive property useful for the additive source modeling, to better deal with the large dynamic range of the direct sound. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed α-AR-FastMNMF works well as a front-end of an automatic speech recognition system. It outperforms α-AR-ILRMA, which is a special case of α-AR-FastMNMF, and their Gaussian counterparts, i.e., AR-FastMNMF and AR-ILRMA, in terms of the speech signal quality metrics and word error rate",

We aim to train a unique deep neural network (DNN) potentially performing well on unseen microphone arrays. The microphone array geometry shapes the network's parameters when training on a fixed microphone array, and thus restricts the generalization of the trained network to another microphone array. To resolve this problem, a single network is trained using data recorded by various microphone arrays of different geometries. We design three variants of our recently proposed narrowband network to cope with the agnostic number of microphones. Overall, the goal is to make the network learn the universal information for speech enhancement that is available for any array geometry, rather than learn the one-array-dedicated characteristics. The experiments on both simulated and real room impulse responses (RIR) demonstrate the excellent across-array generalization capability of the proposed networks, in the sense that their performance measures are very close to, or even exceed the network trained with test arrays. Moreover, they notably outperform various beamforming methods and other advanced deep-learning-based methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the most widely used cues for sound source localization is the interchannel phase differences (IPDs) in the frequency domain. However, the spatial aliasing makes the utilization of the IPDs in the high frequencies difficult, especially when the distance between the microphones is high. Recently, the phase replication method which considers the direction-of-arrival (DoA) candidates corresponding to all the possible unwrapped phase differences in all frequency bins was proposed. However, high frequency bins with possible spatial aliasing contribute more when constructing initial DoA histograms compared with low frequency bins, which may not be desirable for source localization. In this paper, we propose to utilize the IPDs in all the frequency bins with equal weights regardless of maximum number of phase wrapping in that frequency for dual microphone sound source localization. We applied spectral masks based on local signal-to-noise ratios and coherences between microphone signals to exclude time-frequency bins without directional audio signal from the DoA histogram construction. Experimental results show that the proposed method results in more distinct peaks in the DoA histogram and outperforms the conventional method in various noisy and reverberant environments",

We propose a cooperative cross-talk cancellation solution breaking the single active speaker assumption employed by most telecommunication systems. The proposed method applies source separation on the microphone signals of independent devices, to extract the dominant speaker in each device. It is realized using a localization estimator based on a deep neural network, followed by a time-frequency mask to separate the target speech from the interfering one at each time-frequency unit referring to its orientation. By experimental evaluation, we confirm that the proposed method effectively reduces crosstalk and exceeds the baseline expectation maximization method by 10 dB in terms of interference rejection. This performance makes the proposed method a viable solution for cross-talk cancellation in near-field conditions, thus protecting the privacy of external speakers in the same acoustic space",

Under such a framework, the neural network is usually pre-trained with massive unlabeled data and then fine-tuned with limited labeled data. However, the non-streaming architecture like bidirectional transformer is usually adopted by the neural network to achieve competitive results, which cannot be used in streaming scenarios. In this paper, we mainly focus on improving the performance of streaming transformer under the self-supervised learning framework. Specifically, we propose a novel two-stage training method during fine-tuning, which combines knowledge distilling and self-training.

Finally, by only using the 100h clean subset of Librispeech as the labeled data and the rest (860h) as the unlabeled data, our streaming transformer based model obtains competitive WERs 3.5/8.7 on Librispeech clean/noisy test sets",

    "abstract": "The use of semi-supervised training (SST) has become an increasingly popular way of increasing the performance of ASR acoustic models without the need for further transcribed speech data. However, the performance of the technique can be very sensitive to the quality of the initial ASR system. This paper undertakes a comprehensive study of the improvements gained with respect to variation in the initial systems, the quantity of untranscribed data used, and the learning schedules. We postulate that the reason SST can be effective even when the initial model is poor is because it enables utterance-level information to be propagated to the frame level, and hence hypothesise that the quality of the language model plays a much larger role than the quality of the acoustic model.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning of speech representations has been a very active research area but most work is focused on a single domain such as read audio books for which there exist large quantities of labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we explore more general setups where the domain of the unlabeled data for pre-training data differs from the domain of the labeled data for fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to large performance improvements across a variety of setups. With no access to in-domain labeled data, pre-training on unlabeled in-domain data closes 66–73% of the performance gap between the ideal setting of in-domain labeled data and a competitive supervised out-of-domain model. This has obvious practical implications since it is much easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance on domains not seen during training. We will release pre-trained models",

While PL can be further improved by iteratively updating pseudo-labels as the model evolves, most of the previous approaches involve inefficient retraining of the model or intricate control of the label update. We present (MPL), a simple yet effective strategy for semi-supervised ASR. MPL consists of a pair of and models that interact and learn from each other, inspired by the mean teacher method. The online model is trained to predict pseudo-labels generated on the fly by the offline model. The offline model maintains a momentum-based moving average of the online model. MPL is performed in a single training process and the interaction between the two models effectively helps them reinforce each other to improve the ASR performance. We apply MPL to an end-to-end ASR model based on the connectionist temporal classification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPL effectively improves over the base model and is scalable to different semi-supervised scenarios with varying amounts of data or domain mismatch",

Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), which continuously trains a single model using pseudo-labels iteratively re-generated as the model learns, has been shown to further improve performance in ASR. We improve upon the IPL algorithm: as the model learns, we propose to iteratively re-generate transcriptions with hard labels (the most probable tokens), that is, a language model. We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and give a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based models. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces sensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improved training stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5–4× fewer computational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art semi/self-supervised approaches.

As an illustration, this approach is used to investigate gender-related and language-related accuracy differences with three diarization systems: a baseline system using subsegment x-vector clustering, a variant of it with shorter subsegments, and a third system based on a Bayesian hidden Markov model. Our analysis shows large accuracy disparities for the baseline system primarily due to conversational structure, which are partially mitigated in the other two systems.

In practice, transcriptions generated by automatic speech recognition systems are not highly readable because they often include many disfluencies and do not include punctuation marks. To improve their readability, multiple spoken-text-style conversion modules that individually model a single conversion task are cascaded because matched datasets that simultaneously handle multiple conversion tasks are often unavailable. However, the cascading is unstable against the order of tasks because of the chain of conversion errors. Besides, the computation cost of the cascading must be higher than the single conversion. To execute multiple conversion tasks simultaneously without preparing matched datasets, our key idea is to distinguish individual conversion tasks using the In our proposed zero-shot joint modeling, we switch the individual tasks using multiple switching tokens, enabling us to utilize a zero-shot learning approach to executing simultaneous conversions.

Accordingly, the task of detecting spoofing speech also attracts research attention. In the latest ASVspoof 2019 challenge, the best spoofing detection model can distinguish most artificial utterances from natural ones. Inspired by recent progress of adversarial example generation, this paper proposes an adversarial post-processing network (APN) which generates adversarial examples against a neural-network-based spoofing detector by white-box attack. The APN model post-processes the speech waveforms generated by a baseline voice conversion system. An adversarial loss derived from the spoofing detector together with two regularization losses are applied to optimize the parameters of APN.

To address this distortion problem, we propose a novel StarGAN framework along with a two-stage training process that separates emotional features from those independent of emotion by using an autoencoder with two encoders as the generator of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed model achieves favourable results in both the objective evaluation and the subjective evaluation in terms of distortion, which reveals that the proposed model can effectively reduce distortion.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current voice conversion (VC) methods can successfully convert timbre of the audio. As modeling source audio's prosody effectively is a challenging task, there are still limitations of transferring source style to the converted speech. This study proposes a source style transfer method based on recognition-synthesis framework. Previously in speech generation task, prosody can be modeled explicitly with prosodic features or implicitly with a latent prosody extractor. In this paper, taking advantages of both, we model the prosody in a hybrid manner, which effectively combines explicit and implicit methods in a proposed prosody module. Specifically, prosodic features are used to explicit model prosody, while VAE and reference encoder are used to implicitly model prosody, which take Mel spectrum and bottleneck feature as input respectively. Furthermore, adversarial training is introduced to remove speaker-related information from the VAE outputs, avoiding leaking source speaker information while transferring style. Finally, we use a modified self-attention based encoder to extract sentential context from bottleneck features, which also implicitly aggregates the prosodic aspects of source speech from the layered representations. Experiments show that our approach is superior to the baseline and a competitive system in terms of style transfer; meanwhile, the speech quality and speaker similarity are well maintained",

Various any-to-any VC approaches have been proposed like AutoVC, AdaINVC, and FragmentVC. AutoVC, and AdaINVC utilize source and target encoders to disentangle the content and speaker information of the features. FragmentVC utilizes two encoders to encode source and target information and adopts cross attention to align the source and target features with similar phonetic content. Moreover, pretrained features are adopted. AutoVC used d-vector to extract speaker information, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features like wav2vec 2.0 is used in FragmentVC to extract the phonetic content information. Different from previous works, we proposed S2VC that utilizes Self-Supervised features as both source and target features for the VC model. Supervised phoneme posteriorgram (PPG), which is believed to be speaker-independent and widely used in VC to extract content information, is chosen as a strong baseline for SSL features. The objective evaluation and subjective evaluation both show models taking SSL feature CPC as both source and target features outperforms that taking PPG as source feature, suggesting that SSL features have great potential in improving VC",

    "abstract": "Factorizing speech as disentangled speech representations is vital to achieve highly controllable style transfer in voice conversion (VC). Conventional speech representation learning methods in VC only factorize speech as speaker and content, lacking controllability on other prosody-related factors. State-of-the-art speech representation learning methods for more speech factors are using primary disentangle algorithms such as random resampling and ad-hoc bottleneck layer size adjustment, which however is hard to ensure robust speech representation disentanglement. To increase the robustness of highly controllable style transfer on multiple factors in VC, we propose a disentangled speech representation learning framework based on adversarial learning. Four speech representations characterizing content, timbre, rhythm and pitch are extracted, and further disentangled by an adversarial Mask-And-Predict (MAP) network inspired by BERT. The adversarial network is used to minimize the correlations between the speech representations, by randomly masking and predicting one of the representations from the others. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of VC on multiple factors by increasing the speech quality MOS from 2.79 to 3.30 and decreasing the MCD from 3.89 to 3.58",

Countermeasures have hence been developed to protect ASV systems from such attacks. Given that recordings of speech contain potentially sensitive information, any system operating upon them, including spoofing countermeasures, must have provisions for privacy preservation. While privacy enhancing technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption or Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) are effective in preserving privacy, these tend to impact upon computational capacity and computational precision, while no available spoofing countermeasures preserve privacy. This paper reports the first solution based upon the combination of shallow neural networks with secure MPC.

The proposed approach employs an adversarial training schedule that aims to minimize an attacker's word error rate (WER) while maintaining a high WWV performance.

The AAE architecture allows us to obtain good synthetic speech leveraging upon a discriminative training of latent vectors. Such synthetic speech is used to build a privacy-preserving classifier when non-sensitive data is not sufficiently available in the public domain. This classifier follows the PATE scheme that uses an ensemble of noisy outputs to label the synthetic samples and guarantee ε-differential privacy (DP) on its derived classifiers. Our proposed framework thus consists of an AAE-based generator and a PATE-based classifier (PATE-AAE). Evaluated on the Google Speech Commands Dataset Version II, the proposed PATE-AAE improves the average classification accuracy by +2.11% and +6.60%, respectively, when compared with alternative privacy-preserving solutions, namely PATE-GAN and DP-GAN, while maintaining a strong level of privacy target at ε=0.01 with a fixed δ=10 ",

Although current detection approaches have achieved promising results on dataset-specific scenarios, they encounter difficulties on unseen spoofing data. Fine-tuning and retraining from scratch have been applied to incorporate new data. However, fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on previous data. Retraining takes a lot of time and computation resources. Besides, previous data are unavailable due to privacy in some situations. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes detecting fake without forgetting, a continual-learning-based method, to make the model learn new spoofing attacks incrementally. A knowledge distillation loss is introduced to loss function to preserve the memory of original model. Supposing the distribution of genuine voice is consistent among different scenarios, an extra embedding similarity loss is used as another constraint to further do a positive sample alignment.

Using models trained with standard methods and public datasets, we demonstrate that without any knowledge of the target model's parameters or training data a MIA can successfully infer membership with precision and recall more than 60%. Furthermore, for utterances from about 39% of the speakers the precision is more than 75%, indicating that training data membership can be inferred more precisely for some speakers than others. While strong regularization reduces the overall accuracy of MIA to almost 50%, the attacker can still infer membership for utterances from 25% of the speakers with high precision. These results indicate that (1) speaker-level MIA success should be reported, along with overall accuracy, to provide a holistic view of the model's vulnerability and (2) conventional regularization is an inadequate defense against MIA.We believe that the insights gleaned from this study can direct future work towards more effective defenses",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Serum and saliva-based testing methods have been crucial to slowing the COVID-19 pandemic, yet have been limited by slow throughput and cost. A system able to determine COVID-19 status from cough sounds alone would provide a low cost, rapid, and remote alternative to current testing methods. We explore the applicability of recent techniques such as pre-training and spectral augmentation in improving the performance of a neural cough classification system. We use Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC) to pre-train a unidirectional LSTM on the COUGHVID dataset. We then generate our final model by fine-tuning added BLSTM layers on the DiCOVA challenge dataset. We perform various ablation studies to see how each component impacts performance and improves generalization with a small dataset. Our final system achieves an AUC of 85.35 and places third out of 29 entries in the DiCOVA challenge",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the automatic recognition of COVID-19 from coughing. In particular, it describes our contribution to the DiCOVA challenge — Track 1, which addresses such cough sound analysis for COVID-19 detection. Pathologically, the effects of a COVID-19 infection on the respiratory system and on breathing patterns are known. We demonstrate the use of breathing patterns of the cough audio signal in identifying the COVID-19 status. Breathing patterns of the cough audio signal are derived using a model trained with the subset of the UCL Speech Breath Monitoring (UCL-SBM) database. This database provides speech recordings of the participants while their breathing values are captured by a respiratory belt. We use an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder encodes the audio signal into breathing patterns and the decoder decodes the COVID-19 status for the corresponding breathing patterns using an attention mechanism. The encoder uses a pre-trained model which predicts breathing patterns from the speech signal, and transfers the learned patterns to cough audio signals With this architecture, we achieve an AUC of 64.42% on the evaluation set of Track 1",

    "abstract": "In this paper we investigate the cues of COVID-19 on sustained phonation of Vowel-/i/, deep breathing and number counting data of the DiCOVA dataset. We use an ensemble of classifiers trained on different features, namely, super-vectors, formants, harmonics and MFCC features. We fit a two-class Weighted SVM classifier to separate the COVID-19 audio from Non-COVID-19 audio. Weighted penalties help mitigate the challenge of class imbalance in the dataset. The results are reported on the stationary (breathing, Vowel-/i/) and non-stationary (counting data) data using individual and combination of features on each type of utterance. We find that the Formant information plays a crucial role in classification. The proposed system resulted in an AUC score of 0.734 for cross validation, and 0.717 for evaluation dataset",
