    "title": "Conversion of Airborne to Bone-Conducted Speech with Deep Neural Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is a common experience of most speakers that the playback of one's own voice sounds strange. This can be mainly attributed to the missing bone-conducted speech signal that is not present in the playback signal. It was also shown that some phonemes have a high bone-conducted relative to air-conducted sound transmission, which means that the bone-conduction filter is phone-dependent. To achieve such a phone-dependent modeling we train different speaker dependent and speaker adaptive speech conversion systems using airborne and bone-conducted speech data from 8 speakers (5 male, 3 female), which allow for the conversion of airborne speech to bone-conducted speech. The systems are based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep neural networks, where the speaker adaptive versions with speaker embedding can be used without bone-conduction signals from the target speaker. Additionally we also used models that apply a global filtering. The different models are then evaluated by an objective error metric and a subjective listening experiment, which show that the LSTM based models outperform the global filters",

In this paper, we, therefore, introduce a T5G2P model, a Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) neural network model which is able to convert an input text sentence into a phoneme sequence with a high accuracy. The evaluation of our trained T5 model is carried out on English and Czech, since there are different specific properties of G2P, including homograph disambiguation, cross-word assimilation and irregular pronunciation of loanwords. The paper also contains an analysis of a homographs issue in English and offers another approach to Czech phonetic transcription using the detection of pronunciation exceptions",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural vocoders are systematically evaluated on homogeneous train and test databases. This kind of evaluation is efficient to compare neural vocoders in their \"comfort zone\", yet it hardly reveals their limits towards unseen data during training. To compare their extrapolation capabilities, we introduce a methodology that aims at quantifying the robustness of neural vocoders in synthesising unseen data, by precisely controlling the ranges of seen/unseen data in the training database. By focusing in this study on the pitch (F ) parameter, our methodology involves a careful splitting of a dataset to control which F values are seen/unseen during training, followed by both global (utterance) and local (frame) evaluation of vocoders. Comparison of four types of vocoders (autoregressive, sourcefilter, flows, GAN) displays a wide range of behaviour towards unseen input pitch values, including excellent extrapolation (WaveGlow); widely-spread F errors (WaveRNN); and systematic generation of the training set median F (LPCNet, Parallel WaveGAN). In contrast, fewer differences between vocoders were observed when using homogeneous train and test sets, thus demonstrating the potential and need for such evaluation to better discriminate the neural vocoders abilities to generate out-of-training-range data",

To investigate the difference in output quality between corresponding monolingual and multilingual models, we propose a novel measure to compare this difference across the included studies and their various evaluation metrics. This measure, called the Multilingual Model Effect (MLME), is found to be affected by: acoustic model architecture, the difference ratio of target language data between corresponding multilingual and monolingual experiments, the balance ratio of target language data to total data, and the amount of target language data used. These findings can act as reference for data strategies in future experiments with multilingual TTS models for LRLs.

There is a need to better understand the long-term effects of a TBI for objective tracking of an individual's recovery, which could be used to determine intervention trajectories. This study utilizes acoustic features derived from recordings of speech tasks completed by active-duty service members and veterans (SMVs) enrolled in the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury (DVBIC)/Traumatic Brain Injury Center of Excellence (TBICoE) 15-Year Longitudinal TBI Study. We hypothesize that the individuals diagnosed with moderate to severe TBI would demonstrate motor speech impairments through decreased coordination of the speech production subsystems as compared to individuals with no history of TBI. Speech motor coordination is measured through correlations of acoustic feature time series representing speech subsystems. Eigenspectra derived from these correlations are utilized in machine learning models to discriminate between the two groups. The fusion of correlation features derived from the recordings achieves an AUC of 0.78. This suggests that residual motor impairments from moderate to severe TBI could be detectable through objective measures of speech motor coordination",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease produces several motor symptoms, including different speech impairments that are known as hypokinetic dysarthria. Symptoms associated to dysarthria affect different dimensions of speech such as phonation, articulation, prosody, and intelligibility. Studies in the literature have mainly focused on the analysis of articulation and prosody because they seem to be the most prominent symptoms associated to dysarthria severity. However, phonation impairments also play a significant role to evaluate the global speech severity of Parkinson's patients. This paper proposes an extensive comparison of different methods to automatically evaluate the severity of specific phonation impairments in Parkinson's patients. The considered models include the computation of perturbation and glottal-based features, in addition to features extracted from a zero frequency filtered signals. We consider as well end-to-end models based on 1D CNNs, which are trained to learn features from the raw speech waveform, reconstructed glottal signals, and zero-frequency filtered signals. The results indicate that it is possible to automatically classify between speakers with low versus high phonation severity due to the presence of dysarthria and at the same time to evaluate the severity of the phonation impairments on a continuous scale, posed as a regression problem",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and the parkinsonian variant of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA-P) are two neurodegenerative diseases which share similar clinical features, particularly in early disease stages. The differential diagnosis can be thus very challenging. Dysarthria is known to be a frequent and early clinical feature of PD and MSA. It can be thus used as a vehicle to provide a vocal biomarker which could help in the differential diagnosis. In particular, distortion of consonants is known to be a frequent impairment in these diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate distinctive patterns in the distortion of voiced obstruents (plosives and fricatives). It is the first study which attempts to examine such distortions in the French language for the purpose of the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA-P (and among the very few studies if we consider all languages). We carry out a perceptual and objective analysis of voiced obstruents extracted from isolated pseudo-words initials. We first show that devoicing is a significant impairment which predominates in MSA-P. We then show that voice onset time (VOT) of voiced plosives (prevoicing duration) can be a complementary feature to improve the accuracy in discrimination between PD and MSA-P",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding (SLU) systems avoid an intermediate textual representation by mapping speech directly into intents with slot values. This approach requires considerable domain-specific training data. In low-resource scenarios this is a major concern, e.g., in the present study dealing with SLU for dysarthric speech. Pretraining part of the SLU model for automatic speech recognition targets helps but no research has shown to which extent SLU on dysarthric speech benefits from knowledge transferred from other dysarthric speech tasks. This paper investigates the efficiency of pre-training strategies for SLU tasks on dysarthric speech. The designed SLU system consists of a TDNN acoustic model for feature encoding and a capsule network for intent and slot decoding. The acoustic model is pre-trained in two stages: initialization with a corpus of normal speech and finetuning on a mixture of dysarthric and normal speech. By introducing the intelligibility score as a metric of the impairment severity, this paper quantitatively analyzes the relation between generalization and pathology severity for dysarthric speech",

The dataset consists of 21386 audio recordings from 24 healthy and 31 dysarthric speakers, whose individual degree of speech impairment was assessed by neurologists through the Therapy Outcome Measure. The corpus aims at providing a resource for the development of ASR-based assistive technologies for patients with dysarthria. In particular, it may be exploited to develop a voice-controlled contact application for commercial smartphones, aiming at improving dysarthric patients' ability to communicate with their family and caregivers. Before recording the dataset, participants were administered a survey to evaluate which commands are more likely to be employed by dysarthric individuals in a voice-controlled contact application. In addition, the dataset includes a list of non-commands (i.e., words near/inside commands or phonetically close to commands) that can be leveraged to build a more robust command recognition system. At present commercial ASR systems perform poorly on the EasyCall Corpus as we report in this paper. This result corroborates the need for dysarthric speech corpora for developing effective assistive technologies.

We recently performed a comprehensive review of those models and unified them into a general class called Dynamical Variational Autoencoders (DVAEs).

    "abstract": "Accurate phoneme detection and processing can enhance speech intelligibility in hearing aids and audio & speech codecs. As fricative phonemes have an important part of their energy concentrated in high frequency bands, frequency lowering algorithms are used in hearing aids to improve fricative intelligibility for people with high-frequency hearing loss. In traditional audio codecs, while processing speech in blocks, spectral smearing around fricative phoneme borders results in pre and post echo artifacts. Hence, detecting the fricative borders and adapting the processing accordingly could enhance the quality of speech. Until recently, phoneme detection and analysis were mostly done by extracting features specific to the class of phonemes. In this paper, we present a deep learning based fricative phoneme detection algorithm that exceeds the state-of-the-art fricative phoneme detection accuracy on the TIMIT speech corpus. Moreover, we compare our method to other approaches that employ classical signal processing for fricative detection and also evaluate it on the TIMIT files coded with AAC codec followed by bandwidth limitation. Reported results of our deep learning approach on original TIMIT files are reproducible and come with an easy to use code that could serve as a baseline for any future research on this topic",

    "abstract": "Mutual information (MI) is useful in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. Maximizing the MI between the low-level features and the learned embeddings can preserve meaningful information in the embeddings, which can contribute to performance gains. This strategy is called deep InfoMax (DIM) in representation learning. In this paper, we follow the DIM framework so that the speaker embeddings can capture more information from the frame-level features. However, a straightforward implementation of DIM may pose a dimensionality imbalance problem because the dimensionality of the frame-level features is much larger than that of the speaker embeddings. This problem can lead to unreliable MI estimation and can even cause detrimental effects on speaker verification. To overcome this problem, we propose to squeeze the frame-level features before MI estimation through some global pooling methods. We call the proposed method squeeze-DIM. Although the squeeze operation inevitably introduces some information loss, we empirically show that the squeeze-DIM can achieve performance gains on both Voxceleb1 and VOiCES-19 tasks. This suggests that the squeeze operation facilitates the MI estimation and maximization in a balanced dimensional space, which helps learn more informative speaker embeddings",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a serialized multi-layer multi-head attention for neural speaker embedding in text-independent speaker verification. In prior works, frame-level features from one layer are aggregated to form an utterance-level representation. Inspired by the Transformer network, our proposed method utilizes the hierarchical architecture of stacked self-attention mechanisms to derive refined features that are more correlated with speakers. Serialized attention mechanism contains a stack of self-attention modules to create fixed-dimensional representations of speakers. Instead of utilizing multi-head attention in parallel, the proposed serialized multi-layer multi-head attention is designed to aggregate and propagate attentive statistics from one layer to the next in a serialized manner. In addition, we employ an input-aware query for each utterance with the statistics pooling. With more layers stacked, the neural network can learn more discriminative speaker embeddings. Experiment results on VoxCeleb1 dataset and SITW dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline methods, including x-vectors and other x-vectors + conventional attentive pooling approaches by 9.7% in EER and 8.1% in DCF10 ",

    "abstract": "The combination of the recently proposed LPCNet vocoder and a seq-to-seq acoustic model, i.e., Tacotron, has successfully achieved lightweight speech synthesis systems. However, the quality of synthesized speech is often unstable because the precision of the pitch parameters predicted by acoustic models is insufficient, especially for some tonal languages like Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end speech synthesis system, TacoLPCNet, by conditioning LPCNet on Mel spectrogram predictions. First, we extend LPCNet for the Mel spectrogram instead of using explicit pitch information and pitch-related network. Furthermore, we optimize the system by model pruning, multi-frame inference, and increasing frame length, to enable it to meet the conditions required for real-time applications. The objective and subjective evaluation results for various languages show that the proposed system is more stable for tonal languages within the proposed optimization strategies. The experimental results also verify that our model improves synthesis runtime by 3.12 times than that of the baseline on a standard CPU while maintaining naturalness",

However, such DGP models consist of a pipeline architecture of independent models, acoustic and duration models, and require a high level of expertise in text processing. The proposed model is based on Seq2Seq learning, which enables a unified training of acoustic and duration models. The encoder and decoder layers are represented by Gaussian process regressions (GPRs) and the parameters are trained as a Bayesian model. We also propose a self-attention mechanism with Gaussian processes to effectively model character-level input in the encoder. The subjective evaluation results show that the proposed Seq2Seq-SA-DGP can synthesize more natural speech than DNNs with self-attention and recurrent structures.

    "abstract": "The biggest obstacle to develop end-to-end Japanese text-to-speech (TTS) systems is to estimate phonetic and prosodic information (PPI) from Japanese texts. The following are the reasons: (1) the Kanji characters of the Japanese writing system have multiple corresponding pronunciations, (2) there is no separation mark between words, and (3) an accent nucleus must be assigned at appropriate positions. In this paper, we propose to solve the problems by neural machine translation (NMT) on the basis of encoder-decoder models, and compare NMT models of recurrent neural networks and the Transformer architecture. The proposed model handles texts on token (character) basis, although conventional systems handle them on word basis. To ensure the potential of the proposed approach, NMT models are trained using pairs of sentences and their PPIs that are generated by a conventional Japanese TTS system from 5 million sentences. Evaluation experiments were performed using PPIs that are manually annotated for 5,142 sentences. The experimental results showed that the Transformer architecture has the best performance, with 98.0% accuracy for phonetic information estimation and 95.0% accuracy for PPI estimation.

    "abstract": "Expressive neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems incorporate a style encoder to learn a latent embedding as the style information. However, this embedding process may encode redundant textual information. This phenomenon is called content leakage. Researchers have attempted to resolve this problem by adding an ASR or other auxiliary supervision loss functions. In this study, we propose an unsupervised method called the \"information sieve\" to reduce the effect of content leakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that the style encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather than on textual information contained in the reference speech by a well-designed downsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style embeddings can be downsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled by duplication. Furthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution layers to help the system learn a better latent style space. Objective metrics such as the significantly lower word error rate (WER) demonstrate the effectiveness of this model in mitigating content leakage. Listening tests indicate that the model retains its prosody transferability compared with the baseline models such as the original GST-Tacotron and ASR-guided Tacotron",

These models are usually trained with teacher forcing, where the reference back-history is used to predict the next token. This makes training efficient, but limits performance, because during inference the free-running back-history must be used. To address this problem, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq has been used in NMT. Here the output sequence is generated in multiple passes, each one conditioned on the initial input and the free-running output of the previous pass. This paper investigates, and compares, deliberation-based multi-pass seq2seq for TTS and NMT. For NMT the simplest form of multi-pass approaches, where the free-running first-pass output is combined with the initial input, improves performance. However, applying this scheme to TTS is challenging: the multi-pass model tends to converge to the standard single-pass model, ignoring the previous output. To tackle this issue, a guided attention loss is added, enabling the system to make more extensive use of the free-running output.

    "abstract": "Transformer models have shown promising results in neural speech synthesis due to their superior ability to model long-term dependencies compared to recurrent networks. The computation complexity of transformers increases quadratically with sequence length, making it impractical for many real-time applications. To address the complexity issue in speech synthesis domain, this paper proposes an efficient transformer-based acoustic model that is constant-speed regardless of input sequence length, making it ideal for streaming speech synthesis applications. The proposed model uses a transformer network that predicts the prosody features at phone rate and then an Emformer network to predict the frame-rate spectral features in a streaming manner. Both the transformer and Emformer in the proposed architecture use a self-attention mechanism that involves explicit long-term information, thus providing improved speech naturalness for long utterances. In our experiments, we use a WaveRNN neural vocoder that takes in the predicted spectral features and generates the final audio. The overall architecture achieves human-like speech quality both on short and long utterances while maintaining a low latency and low real-time factor. Our mean opinion score (MOS) evaluation shows that for short utterances, the proposed model achieves a MOS of 4.213 compared to ground-truth with MOS of 4.307; and for long utterances, it also produces high-quality speech with a MOS of 4.201 compared to ground-truth with MOS of 4.360",

There are many ways to speed up training with minimal performance loss, such as training with more GPUs, or with mixed precisions, optimizing training parameters, or making features more compact but more representable. Since mini-batch training is now the go-to approach for many machine learning tasks, minimizing the zero-padding to incorporate samples of different lengths into one batch, is an alternative approach to save training time. Here we propose a batching strategy based on semi-sorted samples, with dynamic batch sizes and batch randomization. By replacing the random batching with the proposed batching strategies, it saves more than 40% training time without compromising performance in training seq2seq neural text-to-speech models based on the Tacotron framework. We also compare it with two other batching strategies and show it performs similarly in terms of saving time and maintaining performance, but with a simpler concept and a smoother tuning parameter to balance between zero-padding and randomness level",

The processed stimuli were presented to normal-hearing listeners to recognize. Results showed that, consistent with the segmental contributions in understanding uncompressed speech, the vowel-only time-compressed stimuli were highly intelligible (i.e., intelligibility score >85%) at a TCR around 3, and vowel-consonant transitions carried important intelligibility information in understanding time-compressed sentences. The time-compression conditions in the present work provided higher intelligibility scores than their counterparties in understanding the PSOLA-processed time-compressed sentences with TCRs around 3.

Although effective, CLPSO is computationally expensive to the extent that it overshadows its merits in intelligibility improvement. As a solution to this, the current work aims to improve the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) of (target) speech using a Delta Function that has been generated using a different (source) language.

Recently, neural network-based methods have been applied to speech enhancement. However, many neural network-based methods require users to collect clean speech and background noise for training, which can be time-consuming. In addition, speech enhancement systems trained on particular types of background noise may not generalize well to a wide range of noise. To tackle those problems, we propose a speech enhancement framework trained on weakly labelled data. We first apply a pretrained sound event detection system to detect anchor segments that contain sound events in audio clips. Then, we randomly mix two detected anchor segments as a mixture. We build a conditional source separation network using the mixture and a conditional vector as input. The conditional vector is obtained from the audio tagging predictions on the anchor segments. In inference, we input a noisy speech signal with the one-hot encoding of \"Speech\" as a condition to the trained system to predict enhanced speech.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For speech enhancement, deep complex network based methods have shown promising performance due to their effectiveness in dealing with complex-valued spectrums. Recent speech enhancement methods focus on further optimization of network structures and hyperparameters, however, ignore inherent speech characteristics (e.g., phonetic characteristics), which are important for networks to learn and reconstruct speech information. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning based phone-fortified (SSPF) method for speech enhancement. Our method explicitly imports phonetic characteristics into a deep complex convolutional network via a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) model pre-trained with self-supervised learning. This operation can greatly improve speech representation learning and speech enhancement performance. Moreover, we also apply the self-attention mechanism to our model for learning long-range dependencies of a speech sequence, which further improves the performance of speech enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate that our SSPF method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of speech quality and intelligibility",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Objective measures of success, such as the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR), and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), have recently been used to optimize deep-learning based speech enhancement algorithms, in an effort to incorporate perceptual constraints into the learning process. Optimizing with these measures, however, may be sub-optimal, since the objective scores do not always strongly correlate with a listener's evaluation. This motivates the need for approaches that either are optimized with scores that are strongly correlated with human assessments or that use alternative strategies for incorporating perceptual constraints. In this work, we propose an attention-based approach that uses learned speech embedding vectors from a mean-opinion score (MOS) prediction model and a speech enhancement module to jointly enhance noisy speech. Our loss function is jointly optimized with signal approximation and MOS prediction loss terms. We train the model using real-world noisy speech data that has been captured in everyday environments. The results show that our proposed model significantly outperforms other approaches that are optimized with objective measures",

    "abstract": "There are many deterministic mathematical operations (e.g. compression, clipping, downsampling) that degrade speech quality considerably. In this paper we introduce a neural network architecture, based on a modification of the DiffWave model, that aims to restore the original speech signal. DiffWave, a recently published diffusion-based vocoder, has shown state-of-the-art synthesized speech quality and relatively shorter waveform generation times, with only a small set of parameters. We replace the mel-spectrum upsampler in DiffWave with a deep CNN upsampler, which is trained to alter the degraded speech mel-spectrum to match that of the original speech. The model is trained using the original speech waveform, but conditioned on the degraded speech mel-spectrum. Post-training, only the degraded mel-spectrum is used as input and the model generates an estimate of the original speech. Our model results in improved speech quality (original DiffWave model as baseline) on several different experiments. These include improving the quality of speech degraded by LPC-10 compression, AMR-NB compression, and signal clipping. Compared to the original DiffWave architecture, our scheme achieves better performance on several objective perceptual metrics and in subjective comparisons. Improvements over baseline are further amplified in a out-of-corpus evaluation setting",

In human communication, we can recover from them by repeating misrecognized words or phrases; however in human-machine communication this recovery mechanism is not available. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap and present a system that allows a user to correct speech recognition errors in a virtual assistant by repeating misunderstood words. When a user repeats part of the phrase the system rewrites the original query to incorporate the correction. This rewrite allows the virtual assistant to understand the original query successfully. We present an end-to-end 2-step attention pointer network that can generate the the rewritten query by merging together the incorrectly understood utterance with the correction follow-up. We evaluate the model on data collected for this task and compare the proposed model to a rule-based baseline and a standard pointer network. We show that rewriting the original query is an effective way to handle repetition-based recovery and that the proposed model outperforms the rule based baseline, reducing Word Error Rate by 19% relative at 2% False Alarm Rate on annotated data",

    "abstract": "As an essential component in task-oriented dialogue systems, dialogue state tracking (DST) aims to track human-machine interactions and generate state representations for managing the dialogue. Representations of dialogue states are dependent on the domain ontology and the user's goals. In several task-oriented dialogues with a limited scope of objectives, dialogue states can be represented as a set of slot-value pairs. As the capabilities of dialogue systems expand to support increasing naturalness in communication, incorporating dialogue act processing into dialogue model design becomes essential. The lack of such consideration limits the scalability of dialogue state tracking models for dialogues having specific objectives and ontology. To address this issue, we formulate and incorporate dialogue acts, and leverage recent advances in machine reading comprehension to predict both categorical and non-categorical types of slots for multi-domain dialogue state tracking.

Existing state-of-the-art few-shot model, Prototypical Network (PN), mainly focus on computing the similarity between examples in a metric space by leveraging sentence-level instance representations. However, sentence-level representations may incorporate highly noisy signals from unrelated words which leads to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose Semantic Transportation Prototypical Network (STPN) to alleviate this issue. Different from the original PN, our approach takes word-level representation as input and uses a new distance metric to obtain better sample matching result. And we reformulate the few-shot classification task into an instance of optimal matching, in which the key word semantic information between examples are expected to be matched and the matching cost is treated as similarity. Specifically, we design Mutual-Semantic mechanism to generate word semantic information, which could reduce the unrelated word noise and enrich key word information. Then, Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is applied to find an optimal matching solution.

Under such strong constraints, single-channel speech enhancement becomes a key technology because methods with multiple-passes or batch processing, such as acoustic model adaptation, are not suitable for use. However, single-channel speech enhancement often degrades ASR performance due to speech distortion. To overcome this problem, we propose a noise robust acoustic modeling method based on the stream-wise transformer model. The proposed method accepts multi-stream features obtained by multiple single-channel speech enhancement methods as input and selectively uses an appropriate feature stream according to the noise environment by paying attention to the noteworthy stream on the basis of multi-head attention. The proposed method considers the attention for the stream direction instead of the time series direction, and it is thus capable of real-time and low-latency processing. Comparative evaluations reveal that the proposed method successfully improves the accuracy of ASR in noisy environments and reduces the number of model parameters even under strong constraints",

It is known that channel selection is an important problem of ad-hoc microphone arrays, however, this topic seems far from explored in speech recognition yet, particularly with a large-scale ad-hoc microphone array. To address this problem, we propose a algorithm for the channel selection problem of the speech recognition with large-scale ad-hoc microphone arrays. Specifically, we first replace the conventional Softmax operator in the stream attention mechanism of a multichannel end-to-end speech recognition system with Sparsemax, which conducts channel selection by forcing the channel weights of noisy channels to zero. Because Sparsemax punishes the weights of many channels to zero harshly, we propose Scaling Sparsemax which punishes the channels mildly by setting the weights of very noisy channels to zero only. Experimental results with ad-hoc microphone arrays of over 30 channels under the conformer speech recognition architecture show that the proposed Scaling Sparsemax yields a word error rate of over 30% lower than Softmax on simulation data sets, and over 20% lower on semi-real data sets, in test scenarios with both matched and mismatched channel numbers",

Finally, compared with Conformer-based E2E baseline without mask training, our model demonstrates about 5.51% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on reading speech and 12.92% on spontaneous speech, respectively. The above approach has also been verified on test-set of open-source data THUYG-20, which shows 20% relative improvements",

    "abstract": "Is pushing numbers on a single benchmark valuable in automatic speech recognition? Research results in acoustic modeling are typically evaluated based on performance on a single dataset. While the research community has coalesced around various benchmarks, we set out to understand generalization performance in acoustic modeling across datasets — in particular, if models trained on a single dataset transfer to other (possibly out-of-domain) datasets. Further, we demonstrate that when a large enough set of benchmarks is used, average word error rate (WER) performance over them provides a good proxy for performance on real-world data. Finally, we show that training a single acoustic model on the most widely-used datasets — combined — reaches competitive performance on both research and real-world benchmarks",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech recognition generally uses hand-engineered acoustic features as input and excludes the feature extraction module from its joint optimization. To extract learnable and adaptive features and mitigate information loss, we propose a new encoder that adopts globally attentive locally recurrent (GALR) networks and directly takes raw waveform as input. We observe improved ASR performance and robustness by applying GALR on different window lengths to aggregate fine-grain temporal information into multi-scale acoustic features. Experiments are conducted on a benchmark dataset and two large-scale Mandarin speech corpus of 5,000 hours and 21,000 hours. With faster speed and comparable model size, our proposed multi-scale GALR waveform encoder achieved consistent character error rate reductions (CERRs) from 7.9% to 28.1% relative over strong baselines, including Conformer and TDNN-Conformer. In particular, our approach demonstrated notable robustness than the traditional handcrafted features and outperformed the baseline MFCC-based TDNN-Conformer model by a 15.2% CERR on a music-mixed real-world speech test set",

To integrate information of audio and visual modalities, a multi-branch network is proposed to learn audio and image representations, and the representations are fused by attention based on semantic similarity to shape the acoustic representations through the probability of anchor vocalization.

To resolve this challenge, in this paper, we propose using multi-channel voice activity detection (VAD) to determine the speech segments of a target speaker while also referencing the output speech from the microphones attached to the other speakers in the group. The conducted evaluation experiments using the actual speech of middle school students during group work lessons showed that our proposed method significantly improves the frame error rate (38.7%) compared to that of the conventional technology, single-channel VAD (49.5%). In our view, conventional approaches, such as distributed microphone arrays and deep learning, are somewhat dependent on the temporal stationarity of the speakers' positions.

Next, to transfer the rich information in audio-based VAD (A-VAD) model trained with a massive audio-only dataset to AV-VAD model built with relatively limited multi-modal data, a cross-modal teacher-student learning framework is then proposed based on cross entropy with regulated KL-divergence. Finally, evaluated on an in-house dataset recorded in realistic conditions using standard VAD metrics, the proposed approach yields consistent and significant improvements over other state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "We present a novel personalized voice activity detection (PVAD) learning method that does not require enrollment data during training. PVAD is a task to detect the speech segments of a specific target speaker at the frame level using enrollment speech of the target speaker. Since PVAD must learn speakers' speech variations to clarify the boundary between speakers, studies on PVAD used large-scale datasets that contain many utterances for each speaker. However, the datasets to train a PVAD model are often limited because substantial cost is needed to prepare such a dataset. In addition, we cannot utilize the datasets used to train the standard VAD because they often lack speaker labels. To solve these problems, our key idea is to use one utterance as both a kind of enrollment speech and an input to the PVAD during training, which enables PVAD training without enrollment speech. In our proposed method, called enrollment-less training, we augment one utterance so as to create variability between the input and the enrollment speech while keeping the speaker identity, which avoids the mismatch between training and inference. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the method",

This study proposes a VAD model through the tandem connection of neural network-based noise separation and a VAD model. By training the two models simultaneously, the noise separation model is expected to be trained to consider the VAD results, and thus effective noise separation can be achieved. Moreover, the improved speech/noise separation model will improve the accuracy of the VAD model. In this research, we deal with real-live speeches from baseball games, which have a very poor signal-to-noise ratio.

With the growing number of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically incorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability of IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy However, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands which hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these limitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL, that incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of audio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the latency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease the storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile devices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to 78–92% and the storage requirements by 2–4 times without sacrificing its performance. FastICARL enables complete on-device IL, ensuring user privacy as the user data does not need to leave the device",

Recent attempts employ self-supervised training methods, such as contrastive predictive coding (CPC), where the next frame is predicted given past context. However, CPC only looks at the audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a segmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework that can model the signal structure at a higher level e.g. at the phoneme level. In this framework, a convolutional neural network learns frame-level representation from the raw waveform via noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). A differentiable boundary detector finds variable-length segments, which are then used to optimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn segment representations. The differentiable boundary detector allows us to train frame-level and segment-level encoders jointly. Typically, phoneme and word segmentation are treated as separate tasks. We unify them and experimentally show that our single model outperforms existing phoneme and word segmentation methods on TIMIT and Buckeye datasets. We analyze the impact of boundary threshold and when is the right time to include the segmental loss in the learning process",

PA thus belongs, like most dialects of Arabic, to true voicing languages, i.e., languages with a contrast between voicing lead and short lag VOT We furthermore tested whether the phoneme /b/, without voiceless counterpart /p/ in PA, has similar VOT values to /d, d /, which have voiceless counterparts /t, t /. Similarly, we compared /k/, without counterpart /g/ in the PA dialect we investigated, to /t, t /. For /b/ we found very similar VOT values to /d, d /, while for /k/ we found a difference to /t, t /, attributable to a general tendency of velars to have longer VOT than denti-alveolars.

In the present paper, DeepFormants is integrated into semi-automatic speaker recognition systems using long-term formant distributions and compared against systems using traditional linear predictive coding. The readiness of the tool is assessed on overall speaker recognition performance, measured using equal error rates (EER) and the log LR cost functions (C ). In high-quality conditions, DeepFormants outperforms the best performing LPC systems. Much poorer overall performance is found in channel mismatch conditions for DeepFormants, suggesting it is not adaptable to conditions it was not originally trained on. However, this is also true of LPC methods, raising questions over the validity of using formant analysis at all in such cases. A major benefit of DeepFormants over LPC is that the analyst does not need to specify settings. We discuss the implications of this with regard to results for individual speakers",

In a second series of tests the duration of formant input in the compared files was reduced from 10 seconds to 5 and then to 2.5. All tests were performed both without and with the use of MAP adaptation. Results were evaluated in terms of overall performance characteristics EER and Cllr and in terms of score distributions visualized as Tippett plots. The main goal of the study was to compare the use and non-use of MAP and to look at the practical forensic implications of the difference. Results show that in terms of overall performance characteristics there is little difference between the selection and de-selection of MAP. Tippett plot patterns however reveal strong differences. Application of MAP allows for more symmetric same- and different-speaker distributions and shows more robustness against duration reductions, both of which are forensically important",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study considers issues of language- and speaker-specificity in long-term formant distributions (LTFDs) from phonetic and forensic perspectives and examines their potential value in cases of cross-language forensic voice comparison. Acoustic analysis of 60 male English–French bilinguals revealed systematic differences in LTFDs between the two languages, with higher LTF2–4 in French than in English. Cross-linguistic differences in the shapes of LTFDs were also found. These differences are argued to reflect not only vowel inventories of each language but also language-specific phonetic settings. At the same time, a high degree of within-speaker consistency was found across languages. Likelihood ratio based testing was carried out to examine the effect of language mismatch on the utility of LTFDs as speaker discriminants. Results showed that while the performance of LTFDs was worse in cross-language comparisons than in same-language comparisons, they were still capable of providing speaker-specific information. These findings demonstrate that, in spite of deteriorated performance, LTFDs are still potentially useful speaker discriminants in cases of language mismatch. These findings thus call for further empirical investigation into the use of linguistic-phonetic features in cross-language comparisons",

This project aims to describe the status of /n/ and /l/ in bilingual Cantonese and English speech to better understand individual differences at the interface of crosslinguistic influence and sound change. We examine bilingual speech using the SpiCE corpus, composed of speech from 34 early Cantonese-English bilinguals. Acoustic measures were collected on pre-vocalic nasal and lateral onsets in both languages. If bilinguals maintain separate representations for corresponding segments across languages, smaller differences between /n/ and /l/ are predicted in Cantonese compared to English. Measures of mid-frequency spectral tilt suggest that the /n/ and /l/ contrast is robustly maintained in English, but not Cantonese. The spacing of F2-F1 suggests small differences between Cantonese /n/ and /l/, and robust differences in English. While cross-language categories appear independent, substantial individual differences exist in the data. These data contribute to the understanding of the /n/ and /l/ merger in Cantonese and other Chinese languages, in addition to providing empirical and theoretical insights into crosslinguistic influence in early bilinguals",

A calibrated decision-level fusion system provides the final classification of coughs recordings as either COVID-19 positive or negative.

Distinct patterns were found in the embeddings of phonetic classes that have their place of articulation deep inside the vocal tract. We observed profound differences in classification results for development and test splits, similar to the baseline method We concluded that, based on our phonetic findings, it was safe to assume that our classifier was able to reliably detect a pathological condition located in the respiratory tract.

Deep speaker embeddings are normally trained discriminatively, predicting speaker identity labels on the training data. We hypothesise that additionally predicting speaker-related auxiliary variables — such as age and nationality — may yield representations that are better able to generalise to unseen speakers. We propose a framework for making use of auxiliary label information, even when it is only available for speech corpora mismatched to the target application. On a test set of US Supreme Court recordings, we show that by leveraging two additional forms of speaker attribute information derived respectively from the matched training data, and VoxCeleb corpus, we improve the performance of our deep speaker embeddings for both verification and diarization tasks, achieving a relative improvement of 26.2% in DER and 6.7% in EER compared to baselines using speaker labels only.

Parametric real-valued filters in the first convolutional layer are learned to transform the waveform into time-frequency representations. However, these methods only focus on the magnitude spectrum and the poor interpretability of the learned filters limits the performance. In this paper, we propose a complex speaker embedding extractor, named ICSpk, with higher interpretability and fewer parameters. Specifically, at first, to quantify the speaker-related frequency response of waveform, we modify the original short-term Fourier transform filters into a family of complex exponential filters, named interpretable complex (IC) filters. Each IC filter is confined by a complex exponential filter parameterized by frequency. Then, a deep complex-valued speaker embedding extractor is designed to operate on the complex-valued output of IC filters. The proposed ICSpk is evaluated on VoxCeleb and CNCeleb databases. Experimental results demonstrate the IC filters-based system exhibits a significant improvement over the complex spectrogram based systems.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces an interface that enables the real-time gestural control of intonation in phrases produced by a vocal synthesizer. The melody and timing of a target phrase can be modified by tracing melodic contours on the touch-screen of a mobile tablet. Envisioning this interface as a means for non-native speakers to practice the intonation of a foreign language, we present a pilot study where native and non-native speakers imitated the pronunciation of French phrases using their voice and the interface, with a visual guide and without. Comparison of resulting F0 curves against the reference contour and a preliminary perceptual assessment of synthesized utterances suggest that for both non-native and native speakers, imitation with the help of a visual guide is comparable in accuracy to vocal imitation, and that timing control was a source of difficulty",

    "abstract": "The current study explores whether perception of coarticulatory vowel nasalization differs by speaker age (adult vs. child) and type of voice (naturally produced vs. synthetic speech). Listeners completed a 4IAX discrimination task between pairs containing acoustically identical (both nasal or oral) vowels and acoustically distinct (one oral, one nasal) vowels. Vowels occurred in either the same consonant contexts or different contexts across pairs. Listeners completed the experiment with either naturally produced speech or text-to-speech (TTS). For same-context trials, listeners were better at discriminating between oral and nasal vowels for child speech in the synthetic voices but adult speech in the natural voices. Meanwhile, in different-context trials, listeners were less able to discriminate, indicating more perceptual compensation for synthetic voices. There was no difference in different-context discrimination across talker ages, indicating that listeners did not compensate differently if the speaker was a child or adult. Findings are relevant for models of compensation, computer personification theories, and speaker-indexical perception accounts",

    "abstract": "Decoding the speech signal that a person is listening to from the human brain via electroencephalography (EEG) can help us understand how our auditory system works. Linear models have been used to reconstruct the EEG from speech or vice versa. Recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based architectures have outperformed linear models in modeling the relation between EEG and speech. Before attempting to use these models in real-world applications such as hearing tests or (second) language comprehension assessment we need to know what level of speech information is being utilized by these models. In this study, we aim to analyze the performance of an LSTM-based model using different levels of speech features. The task of the model is to determine which of two given speech segments is matched with the recorded EEG. We used low- and high-level speech features including: envelope, mel spectrogram, voice activity, phoneme identity, and word embedding. Our results suggest that the model exploits information about silences, intensity, and broad phonetic classes from the EEG. Furthermore, the mel spectrogram, which contains all this information, yields the highest accuracy (84%) among all the features",

    "abstract": "We discuss the role of entropy of the set of unfolding word candidates in the context of DIANA, a computational model of human auditory speech comprehension. DIANA consists of three major interacting components: Activation, Decision and Execution. The Activation component computes activations of word candidates that change over time as a function of the unfolding audio input. The resulting set of word candidate activations can be associated with an entropy that is related to difficulty of the decision when one of these candidates must be selected at time T. The paper presents the close relation between entropy measures and the between-word competition during the unfolding of the auditory stimuli, and at the end of the stimuli if no decision could be made before stimulus offset. We present a way for computing the entropy that takes into account linguistic-phonetic constraints that play a role in speech comprehension and in lexical decision experiments. Using the BALDEY data set and linear mixed effects regression models for RT, we show that entropy measures explain differences between RTs of words with different morphological structure",

In this analysis, RTs are considered a by-product of an (unobservable) cumulative incidence function that results in a decision when it exceeds a certain threshold We show that Survival Analysis can be effectively used to narrow the gap between data-oriented models and process-oriented models for RT data from lexical decision experiments.

In a large body of literature, RTs are measured from the onset of the stimulus to the start of the response (often a button press or an oral response). The rationale behind this choice is that information about the stimulus becomes available to the listener starting at onset. Alternatively, the RT from offset is less dependent on stimulus duration and is assumed to focus on those cognitive processes that play a role late(r) in the word and after word offset, when all information is available The paper presents RT-onset and RT-offset-based linear mixed effects models for three different lexical decision-based data sets and explains the significant differences between these models, showing to what extent both definitions of reaction time reveal different roles for predictors and how early and later contributions to the overall RT can be differentiated",

Different from other popular data augmentation methods such as SpecAugment and mixup that only work on the input space, SpecAugment++ is applied to both the input space and the hidden space of the deep neural networks to enhance the input and the intermediate feature representations. For an intermediate hidden state, the augmentation techniques consist of masking blocks of frequency channels and masking blocks of time frames, which improve generalization by enabling a model to attend not only to the most discriminative parts of the feature, but also the entire parts. Apart from using zeros for masking, we also examine two approaches for masking based on the use of other samples within the mini-batch, which helps introduce noises to the networks to make them more discriminative for classification. The experimental results on the DCASE 2018 Task1 dataset and DCASE 2019 Task1 dataset show that our proposed method can obtain 3.6% and 4.7% accuracy gains over a strong baseline without augmentation (i.e. CP-ResNet) respectively, and outperforms other previous data augmentation methods",

Existing methods simply treat the synthetic data as strongly-labeled data in semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Benefiting from the strong labels of synthetic data, superior SED performance can be achieved. However, a distribution mismatch between synthetic and real data raises an evident challenge for domain adaptation (DA). In MMT-DA, convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNN) learned from different datasets (i.e :real+synthetic, and ) are exploited for DA. Specifically, mean teacher method using CRNN is employed for utilizing the unlabeled real data. To compensate the domain diversity, an additional domain classifier with gradient reverse layer(GRL) is used for training a mean teacher for The student CRNNs are mutually taught using the soft predictions of unlabeled data obtained from different teachers. Furthermore, a strip pooling based attention module is exploited to model the inter-dependencies between channels and time-frequency dimensions to exploit the structure information.

The current state-of-the-art approaches to SED employ a shared attention mechanism achieved through a stack of MHSA blocks to detect multiple sound events. Consequently, in a multi-label SED task, a common attention mechanism would be responsible for generating relevant feature representations for each of the events to be detected. In this paper, we show through empirical evaluation that having more MHSA blocks dedicated specifically for individual events, rather than having a stack of shared MHSA blocks, improves the overall detection performance. Interestingly, this improvement in performance comes about because the event-specific attention blocks help in resolving confusions in the case of co-occurring events. The proposed \"Event-specific Attention Network\" (ESA-Net) can be trained in an end-to-end manner. On the DCASE 2020 Task 4 data set, we show that with ESA-Net, the best single model achieves an event-based F1 score of 52.1% on the public validation data set improving over the existing state of the art result",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit good performance in low-complexity classification with fixed-length acoustic scenes. However, previous studies have not considered variable-length acoustic scenes in which performance degradation is prevalent. In this regard, we investigate two novel architectures — convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer) and differentiable neural computer (DNC). Both the models show desirable performance for variable-length data but require a large amount of data. In other words, small amounts of data, such as those from acoustic scenes, lead to overfitting in these models. In this paper, we propose a shallow convolution-augmented Transformer with a differentiable neural computer (shallow Conformer-DNC) for the low-complexity classification of variable-length acoustic scenes. The shallow Conformer-DNC is enabled to converge with small amounts of data. Short-term and long-term contexts of variable-length acoustic scenes are trained by using the shallow Conformer and shallow DNC, respectively. The experiments were conducted for variable-length conditions using the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2020 Mobile dataset. As a result, a peak accuracy of 61.25% was confirmed for shallow Conformer-DNC with a model parameter of 34 K. It is comparable performance to state-of-the-art CNNs",

    "abstract": "Video captioning is an essential technology to understand scenes and describe events in natural language. To apply it to real-time monitoring, a system needs not only to describe events accurately but also to produce the captions as soon as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality, but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual Transformer is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two Transformers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames from the beginning",

    "abstract": "For patients suffering with high-frequency hearing loss and preserving low-frequency hearing, combined electric-acoustic stimulation (EAS) may significantly improve their speech perception compared with cochlear implants (CIs). In combined EAS, a hearing aid provides low-frequency information via acoustic (A) stimulation and a CI evokes high-frequency sound sensation via electrical (E) stimulation. The present work investigated the EAS advantage when only a small number (i.e., 1 or 2) of channels were provided for electrical stimulation in a CI, and the effect of carrier bandwidth on understanding Mandarin sentences in a simulation of combined EAS experiment. The A-portion was extracted via low-pass filtering processing and the E-portion was generated with a vocoder model preserving multi-channel temporal envelope waveforms, whereas a noise-vocoder and a tone-vocoder were used to simulate the effect of carrier bandwidth. The synthesized stimuli were presented to normal-hearing listeners to recognize. Experimental results showed that while low-pass filtered Mandarin speech was not very intelligible, adding one or two E channels could significantly improve the intelligibility score to above 86.0%. Under the condition with one E channel, using a large carrier bandwidth in noise-vocoder processing provided a better intelligibility performance than using a narrow carrier bandwidth in tone-vocoder processing",

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) signals have been extensively used to capture facial muscle movements while speaking since they are one of the most closely related bio-signals generated during speech production. In this work, we focus on speech acoustics to EMG prediction. We present a comparative study of ten different EMG signal-based features including Time Domain (TD) features existing in the literature to examine their effectiveness in speech acoustics to EMG inverse (AEI) mapping. We propose a novel feature based on the Hilbert envelope of the filtered EMG signal. The raw EMG signal is reconstructed from these features as well. For the AEI mapping, we use a bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network in a session-dependent manner. To estimate the raw EMG signal from the EMG features, we use a CNN-BLSTM model comprising of a convolution neural network (CNN) followed by BLSTM layers. AEI mapping performance using the BLSTM network reveals that the Hilbert envelope based feature is predicted from speech with the highest accuracy, among all the features. Therefore, it could be the most representative feature of the underlying muscle activation during speech production. The proposed Hilbert envelope feature, when used together with the existing TD features, improves the raw EMG signal reconstruction performance compared to using the TD features alone",

A robotic simulation is being developed to facilitate Speech Language Pathologists to demonstrate the movement of jaw, tongue and teeth during production of speech sounds, as a part of a larger study. Profiling of jaw movement is an important aspect of articulatory simulation. The present study attempts to develop a simple and efficient technique for deriving the jaw parameters and using them to simulate jaw movements through inverse kinematics Three Kannada speaking male participants in the age range of 26 to 33 years were instructed to produce selected speech sounds. The image of the final position of the jaw during production of each speech sound was recorded through CT scan and video camera. Angle of ramus and angle of body of mandible were simulated through inverse kinematics using RoboAnalyzer software. The variables for inverse kinematics were derived through kinematic analysis. The Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters required for kinematic analysis were obtained from still image. Angles simulated were compared with the angles obtained from CT scan images. No significant difference was observed",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cued Speech (CS) is a communication system for deaf people or hearing impaired people, in which a speaker uses it to aid a lipreader in phonetic level by clarifying potentially ambiguous mouth movements with hand shape and positions. Feature extraction of multi-modal CS is a key step in CS recognition. Recent supervised deep learning based methods suffer from noisy CS data annotations especially for hand shape modality. In this work, we first propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method to learn the feature representation of image without using labels. Secondly, a small amount of manually annotated CS data are used to fine-tune the first module. Thirdly, we present a module, which combines Bi-LSTM and self-attention networks to further learn sequential features with temporal and contextual information. Besides, to enlarge the volume and the diversity of the current limited CS datasets, we build a new British English dataset containing 5 native CS speakers. Evaluation results on both French and British English datasets show that our model achieves over 90% accuracy in hand shape recognition. Significant improvements of 8.75% (for French) and 10.09% (for British English) are achieved in CS phoneme recognition correctness compared with the state-of-the-art",

For this to be realised, the acceptability of remote speech collection to the user must be established, in addition to feasibility from an analytical perspective. To understand the acceptance, facilitators, and barriers of smartphone-based speech recording, we invited 384 individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) from the Remote Assessment of Disease and Relapse — Central Nervous System (RADAR-CNS) research programme in Spain and the UK to complete a survey on their experiences recording their speech. In this analysis, we demonstrate that study participants were more comfortable completing a scripted speech task than a free speech task. For both speech tasks, we found depression severity and country to be significant predictors of comfort. Not seeing smartphone notifications of the scheduled speech tasks, low mood and forgetfulness were the most commonly reported obstacles to providing speech recordings",

The usefulness of ultrasound for biofeedback speech therapy is limited because speakers must mentally track and compare differences between their tongue movement and available models. It is desirable to automate this interpretive task using a single parameter representing deviation from known accurate tongue movements. In this study, displacements recorded automatically by ultrasound image tracking were transformed into a single biofeedback parameter (time-dependent difference between blade and dorsum displacements). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate this parameter as a predictor of production accuracy over a range of different vowel contexts with initial and final /r/ in American English. Areas under ROC curves were 0.8 or above, indicating that this simple parameter may provide useful real-time biofeedback on /r/ accuracy within a range of rhotic contexts",

We train our systems on imaging data from modal speech, and evaluate on matched test sets of two speaking modes: silent and modal speech. We observe that silent speech recognition from imaging data underperforms compared to modal speech recognition, likely due to a speaking-mode mismatch between training and testing. We improve silent speech recognition performance using techniques that address the domain mismatch, such as fMLLR and unsupervised model adaptation. We also analyse the properties of silent and modal speech in terms of utterance duration and the size of the articulatory space. To estimate the articulatory space, we compute the convex hull of tongue splines, extracted from ultrasound tongue images. Overall, we observe that the duration of silent speech is longer than that of modal speech, and that silent speech covers a smaller articulatory space than modal speech. Although these two properties are statistically significant across speaking modes, they do not directly correlate with word error rates from speech recognition",

    "abstract": "Speech is our most natural and efficient way of communication and offers a strong potential to improve how we interact with machines. However, speech communication can sometimes be limited by environmental (e.g., ambient noise), contextual (e.g., need for privacy in a public place), or health conditions (e.g., laryngectomy), hindering the consideration of audible speech. In this regard, silent speech interfaces (SSI) have been proposed (e.g., considering video, electromyography), however, many technologies still face limitations regarding their everyday use, e.g., the need to place equipment in contact with the speaker (e.g., electrodes/ultrasound probe), and raise technical (e.g., lighting conditions for video) or privacy concerns. In this context, the consideration of technologies that can help tackle these issues, e.g, by being contactless and/or placed in the environment, can foster the widespread use of SSI. In this article, continuous-wave radar is explored to assess its potential for SSI. To this end, a corpus of 13 words was acquired, for 3 speakers, and different classifiers were tested on the resulting data. The best results, obtained using Bagging classifier, trained for each speaker, with 5-fold cross-validation, yielded an average accuracy of 0.826, an encouraging result that establishes promising grounds for further exploration of this technology for silent speech recognition",

Although significant progress has been made, most of the recent SSI works focused on data collected from healthy speakers. SSIs for laryngectomees have rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigated the reconstruction of speech for two laryngectomees who either use tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) or electro-larynx (EL) speech as their post-surgery communication mode. We reconstructed their speech using two SSI designs (1) real-time recognition-and-synthesis and (2) directly articulation-to-speech synthesis (ATS). The reconstructed speech samples were measured in subjective evaluation by 20 listeners in terms of naturalness and intelligibility. The results indicated that both designs increased the naturalness of alaryngeal speech. The real-time recognition-and-synthesis design obtained higher intelligibility in electrolarynx speech as well, while the ATS did not. These preliminary results suggest the real-time recognition-and-synthesis design may have a better potential for clinical applications (for laryngectomees) than ATS",

    "abstract": "Fundamental frequency (f ) estimation, also known as pitch tracking, has been a long-standing research topic in the speech and signal processing community. Many pitch estimation algorithms, however, fail in noisy conditions or introduce large delays due to their frame size or Viterbi decoding In this study, we propose a deep learning-based pitch estimation algorithm, LACOPE, which was trained in a joint pitch estimation and speech enhancement framework. In contrast to previous work, this algorithm allows for a configurable latency down to an algorithmic delay of 0. This is achieved by exploiting the smoothness properties of the pitch trajectory. That is, a recurrent neural network compensates delay introduced by the feature computation by predicting the pitch for a desired point, allowing a trade-off between pitch accuracy and latency We integrate the pitch estimation in a speech enhancement framework for hearing aids. For this application, we allow a delay on the analysis side of approx. 5ms. The pitch estimate is then used for constructing a comb filter in frequency domain as post-processing step to remove intra-harmonic noise Our pitch estimation performance is on par with SOTA algorithms like PYIN or CREPE for spoken speech in all noise conditions while introducing minimal latency",

The state-of-the-art versatile blind source separation method called FastMNMF that assumes the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) coefficients of a direct sound to follow a circular complex Gaussian distribution with jointly-diagonalizable full-rank spatial covariance matrices was extended to AR-FastMNMF with an autoregressive reverberation model. Instead of the light-tailed Gaussian distribution, we use the heavy-tailed α-stable distribution, which also has the reproductive property useful for the additive source modeling, to better deal with the large dynamic range of the direct sound. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed α-AR-FastMNMF works well as a front-end of an automatic speech recognition system. It outperforms α-AR-ILRMA, which is a special case of α-AR-FastMNMF, and their Gaussian counterparts, i.e., AR-FastMNMF and AR-ILRMA, in terms of the speech signal quality metrics and word error rate",

We aim to train a unique deep neural network (DNN) potentially performing well on unseen microphone arrays. The microphone array geometry shapes the network's parameters when training on a fixed microphone array, and thus restricts the generalization of the trained network to another microphone array. To resolve this problem, a single network is trained using data recorded by various microphone arrays of different geometries. We design three variants of our recently proposed narrowband network to cope with the agnostic number of microphones. Overall, the goal is to make the network learn the universal information for speech enhancement that is available for any array geometry, rather than learn the one-array-dedicated characteristics. The experiments on both simulated and real room impulse responses (RIR) demonstrate the excellent across-array generalization capability of the proposed networks, in the sense that their performance measures are very close to, or even exceed the network trained with test arrays. Moreover, they notably outperform various beamforming methods and other advanced deep-learning-based methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the most widely used cues for sound source localization is the interchannel phase differences (IPDs) in the frequency domain. However, the spatial aliasing makes the utilization of the IPDs in the high frequencies difficult, especially when the distance between the microphones is high. Recently, the phase replication method which considers the direction-of-arrival (DoA) candidates corresponding to all the possible unwrapped phase differences in all frequency bins was proposed. However, high frequency bins with possible spatial aliasing contribute more when constructing initial DoA histograms compared with low frequency bins, which may not be desirable for source localization. In this paper, we propose to utilize the IPDs in all the frequency bins with equal weights regardless of maximum number of phase wrapping in that frequency for dual microphone sound source localization. We applied spectral masks based on local signal-to-noise ratios and coherences between microphone signals to exclude time-frequency bins without directional audio signal from the DoA histogram construction. Experimental results show that the proposed method results in more distinct peaks in the DoA histogram and outperforms the conventional method in various noisy and reverberant environments",

We propose a cooperative cross-talk cancellation solution breaking the single active speaker assumption employed by most telecommunication systems. The proposed method applies source separation on the microphone signals of independent devices, to extract the dominant speaker in each device. It is realized using a localization estimator based on a deep neural network, followed by a time-frequency mask to separate the target speech from the interfering one at each time-frequency unit referring to its orientation. By experimental evaluation, we confirm that the proposed method effectively reduces crosstalk and exceeds the baseline expectation maximization method by 10 dB in terms of interference rejection. This performance makes the proposed method a viable solution for cross-talk cancellation in near-field conditions, thus protecting the privacy of external speakers in the same acoustic space",

Under such a framework, the neural network is usually pre-trained with massive unlabeled data and then fine-tuned with limited labeled data. However, the non-streaming architecture like bidirectional transformer is usually adopted by the neural network to achieve competitive results, which cannot be used in streaming scenarios. In this paper, we mainly focus on improving the performance of streaming transformer under the self-supervised learning framework. Specifically, we propose a novel two-stage training method during fine-tuning, which combines knowledge distilling and self-training.

Finally, by only using the 100h clean subset of Librispeech as the labeled data and the rest (860h) as the unlabeled data, our streaming transformer based model obtains competitive WERs 3.5/8.7 on Librispeech clean/noisy test sets",

    "abstract": "The use of semi-supervised training (SST) has become an increasingly popular way of increasing the performance of ASR acoustic models without the need for further transcribed speech data. However, the performance of the technique can be very sensitive to the quality of the initial ASR system. This paper undertakes a comprehensive study of the improvements gained with respect to variation in the initial systems, the quantity of untranscribed data used, and the learning schedules. We postulate that the reason SST can be effective even when the initial model is poor is because it enables utterance-level information to be propagated to the frame level, and hence hypothesise that the quality of the language model plays a much larger role than the quality of the acoustic model.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning of speech representations has been a very active research area but most work is focused on a single domain such as read audio books for which there exist large quantities of labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we explore more general setups where the domain of the unlabeled data for pre-training data differs from the domain of the labeled data for fine-tuning, which in turn may differ from the test data domain. Our experiments show that using target domain data during pre-training leads to large performance improvements across a variety of setups. With no access to in-domain labeled data, pre-training on unlabeled in-domain data closes 66–73% of the performance gap between the ideal setting of in-domain labeled data and a competitive supervised out-of-domain model. This has obvious practical implications since it is much easier to obtain unlabeled target domain data than labeled data. Moreover, we find that pre-training on multiple domains improves generalization performance on domains not seen during training. We will release pre-trained models",

While PL can be further improved by iteratively updating pseudo-labels as the model evolves, most of the previous approaches involve inefficient retraining of the model or intricate control of the label update. We present (MPL), a simple yet effective strategy for semi-supervised ASR. MPL consists of a pair of and models that interact and learn from each other, inspired by the mean teacher method. The online model is trained to predict pseudo-labels generated on the fly by the offline model. The offline model maintains a momentum-based moving average of the online model. MPL is performed in a single training process and the interaction between the two models effectively helps them reinforce each other to improve the ASR performance. We apply MPL to an end-to-end ASR model based on the connectionist temporal classification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPL effectively improves over the base model and is scalable to different semi-supervised scenarios with varying amounts of data or domain mismatch",

Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), which continuously trains a single model using pseudo-labels iteratively re-generated as the model learns, has been shown to further improve performance in ASR. We improve upon the IPL algorithm: as the model learns, we propose to iteratively re-generate transcriptions with hard labels (the most probable tokens), that is, a language model. We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and give a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based models. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces sensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improved training stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5–4× fewer computational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art semi/self-supervised approaches.

As an illustration, this approach is used to investigate gender-related and language-related accuracy differences with three diarization systems: a baseline system using subsegment x-vector clustering, a variant of it with shorter subsegments, and a third system based on a Bayesian hidden Markov model. Our analysis shows large accuracy disparities for the baseline system primarily due to conversational structure, which are partially mitigated in the other two systems.

In practice, transcriptions generated by automatic speech recognition systems are not highly readable because they often include many disfluencies and do not include punctuation marks. To improve their readability, multiple spoken-text-style conversion modules that individually model a single conversion task are cascaded because matched datasets that simultaneously handle multiple conversion tasks are often unavailable. However, the cascading is unstable against the order of tasks because of the chain of conversion errors. Besides, the computation cost of the cascading must be higher than the single conversion. To execute multiple conversion tasks simultaneously without preparing matched datasets, our key idea is to distinguish individual conversion tasks using the In our proposed zero-shot joint modeling, we switch the individual tasks using multiple switching tokens, enabling us to utilize a zero-shot learning approach to executing simultaneous conversions.

Accordingly, the task of detecting spoofing speech also attracts research attention. In the latest ASVspoof 2019 challenge, the best spoofing detection model can distinguish most artificial utterances from natural ones. Inspired by recent progress of adversarial example generation, this paper proposes an adversarial post-processing network (APN) which generates adversarial examples against a neural-network-based spoofing detector by white-box attack. The APN model post-processes the speech waveforms generated by a baseline voice conversion system. An adversarial loss derived from the spoofing detector together with two regularization losses are applied to optimize the parameters of APN.

To address this distortion problem, we propose a novel StarGAN framework along with a two-stage training process that separates emotional features from those independent of emotion by using an autoencoder with two encoders as the generator of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The proposed model achieves favourable results in both the objective evaluation and the subjective evaluation in terms of distortion, which reveals that the proposed model can effectively reduce distortion.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current voice conversion (VC) methods can successfully convert timbre of the audio. As modeling source audio's prosody effectively is a challenging task, there are still limitations of transferring source style to the converted speech. This study proposes a source style transfer method based on recognition-synthesis framework. Previously in speech generation task, prosody can be modeled explicitly with prosodic features or implicitly with a latent prosody extractor. In this paper, taking advantages of both, we model the prosody in a hybrid manner, which effectively combines explicit and implicit methods in a proposed prosody module. Specifically, prosodic features are used to explicit model prosody, while VAE and reference encoder are used to implicitly model prosody, which take Mel spectrum and bottleneck feature as input respectively. Furthermore, adversarial training is introduced to remove speaker-related information from the VAE outputs, avoiding leaking source speaker information while transferring style. Finally, we use a modified self-attention based encoder to extract sentential context from bottleneck features, which also implicitly aggregates the prosodic aspects of source speech from the layered representations. Experiments show that our approach is superior to the baseline and a competitive system in terms of style transfer; meanwhile, the speech quality and speaker similarity are well maintained",

Various any-to-any VC approaches have been proposed like AutoVC, AdaINVC, and FragmentVC. AutoVC, and AdaINVC utilize source and target encoders to disentangle the content and speaker information of the features. FragmentVC utilizes two encoders to encode source and target information and adopts cross attention to align the source and target features with similar phonetic content. Moreover, pretrained features are adopted. AutoVC used d-vector to extract speaker information, and self-supervised learning (SSL) features like wav2vec 2.0 is used in FragmentVC to extract the phonetic content information. Different from previous works, we proposed S2VC that utilizes Self-Supervised features as both source and target features for the VC model. Supervised phoneme posteriorgram (PPG), which is believed to be speaker-independent and widely used in VC to extract content information, is chosen as a strong baseline for SSL features. The objective evaluation and subjective evaluation both show models taking SSL feature CPC as both source and target features outperforms that taking PPG as source feature, suggesting that SSL features have great potential in improving VC",

    "abstract": "Factorizing speech as disentangled speech representations is vital to achieve highly controllable style transfer in voice conversion (VC). Conventional speech representation learning methods in VC only factorize speech as speaker and content, lacking controllability on other prosody-related factors. State-of-the-art speech representation learning methods for more speech factors are using primary disentangle algorithms such as random resampling and ad-hoc bottleneck layer size adjustment, which however is hard to ensure robust speech representation disentanglement. To increase the robustness of highly controllable style transfer on multiple factors in VC, we propose a disentangled speech representation learning framework based on adversarial learning. Four speech representations characterizing content, timbre, rhythm and pitch are extracted, and further disentangled by an adversarial Mask-And-Predict (MAP) network inspired by BERT. The adversarial network is used to minimize the correlations between the speech representations, by randomly masking and predicting one of the representations from the others. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the robustness of VC on multiple factors by increasing the speech quality MOS from 2.79 to 3.30 and decreasing the MCD from 3.89 to 3.58",

Countermeasures have hence been developed to protect ASV systems from such attacks. Given that recordings of speech contain potentially sensitive information, any system operating upon them, including spoofing countermeasures, must have provisions for privacy preservation. While privacy enhancing technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption or Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) are effective in preserving privacy, these tend to impact upon computational capacity and computational precision, while no available spoofing countermeasures preserve privacy. This paper reports the first solution based upon the combination of shallow neural networks with secure MPC.

The proposed approach employs an adversarial training schedule that aims to minimize an attacker's word error rate (WER) while maintaining a high WWV performance.

The AAE architecture allows us to obtain good synthetic speech leveraging upon a discriminative training of latent vectors. Such synthetic speech is used to build a privacy-preserving classifier when non-sensitive data is not sufficiently available in the public domain. This classifier follows the PATE scheme that uses an ensemble of noisy outputs to label the synthetic samples and guarantee ε-differential privacy (DP) on its derived classifiers. Our proposed framework thus consists of an AAE-based generator and a PATE-based classifier (PATE-AAE). Evaluated on the Google Speech Commands Dataset Version II, the proposed PATE-AAE improves the average classification accuracy by +2.11% and +6.60%, respectively, when compared with alternative privacy-preserving solutions, namely PATE-GAN and DP-GAN, while maintaining a strong level of privacy target at ε=0.01 with a fixed δ=10 ",

Although current detection approaches have achieved promising results on dataset-specific scenarios, they encounter difficulties on unseen spoofing data. Fine-tuning and retraining from scratch have been applied to incorporate new data. However, fine-tuning leads to performance degradation on previous data. Retraining takes a lot of time and computation resources. Besides, previous data are unavailable due to privacy in some situations. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes detecting fake without forgetting, a continual-learning-based method, to make the model learn new spoofing attacks incrementally. A knowledge distillation loss is introduced to loss function to preserve the memory of original model. Supposing the distribution of genuine voice is consistent among different scenarios, an extra embedding similarity loss is used as another constraint to further do a positive sample alignment.

Using models trained with standard methods and public datasets, we demonstrate that without any knowledge of the target model's parameters or training data a MIA can successfully infer membership with precision and recall more than 60%. Furthermore, for utterances from about 39% of the speakers the precision is more than 75%, indicating that training data membership can be inferred more precisely for some speakers than others. While strong regularization reduces the overall accuracy of MIA to almost 50%, the attacker can still infer membership for utterances from 25% of the speakers with high precision. These results indicate that (1) speaker-level MIA success should be reported, along with overall accuracy, to provide a holistic view of the model's vulnerability and (2) conventional regularization is an inadequate defense against MIA.We believe that the insights gleaned from this study can direct future work towards more effective defenses",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Serum and saliva-based testing methods have been crucial to slowing the COVID-19 pandemic, yet have been limited by slow throughput and cost. A system able to determine COVID-19 status from cough sounds alone would provide a low cost, rapid, and remote alternative to current testing methods. We explore the applicability of recent techniques such as pre-training and spectral augmentation in improving the performance of a neural cough classification system. We use Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC) to pre-train a unidirectional LSTM on the COUGHVID dataset. We then generate our final model by fine-tuning added BLSTM layers on the DiCOVA challenge dataset. We perform various ablation studies to see how each component impacts performance and improves generalization with a small dataset. Our final system achieves an AUC of 85.35 and places third out of 29 entries in the DiCOVA challenge",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents the automatic recognition of COVID-19 from coughing. In particular, it describes our contribution to the DiCOVA challenge — Track 1, which addresses such cough sound analysis for COVID-19 detection. Pathologically, the effects of a COVID-19 infection on the respiratory system and on breathing patterns are known. We demonstrate the use of breathing patterns of the cough audio signal in identifying the COVID-19 status. Breathing patterns of the cough audio signal are derived using a model trained with the subset of the UCL Speech Breath Monitoring (UCL-SBM) database. This database provides speech recordings of the participants while their breathing values are captured by a respiratory belt. We use an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder encodes the audio signal into breathing patterns and the decoder decodes the COVID-19 status for the corresponding breathing patterns using an attention mechanism. The encoder uses a pre-trained model which predicts breathing patterns from the speech signal, and transfers the learned patterns to cough audio signals With this architecture, we achieve an AUC of 64.42% on the evaluation set of Track 1",

    "abstract": "The aim of this contribution is to automatically detect COVID-19 patients by analysing the acoustic information embedded in coughs. COVID-19 affects the respiratory system, and, consequently, respiratory-related signals have the potential to contain salient information for the task at hand. We focus on analysing the spectrogram representations of cough samples with the aim to investigate whether COVID-19 alters the frequency content of these signals. Furthermore, this work also assesses the impact of gender in the automatic detection of COVID-19. To extract deep-learnt representations of the spectrograms, we compare the performance of a cough-specific, and a Resnet18 pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, our approach explores the use of contextual attention, so the model can learn to highlight the most relevant deep-learnt features extracted by the CNN. We conduct our experiments on the dataset released for the Cough Sound Track of the DICOVA 2021 Challenge.

    "abstract": "Cough sounds as a descriptor have been used for detecting various respiratory ailments based on its intensity, duration of intermediate phase between two cough sounds, repetitions, dryness etc. However, COVID-19 diagnosis using only cough sounds is challenging because of cough being a common symptom among many non COVID-19 health diseases and inherent data imbalance within the available datasets. As one of the approach in this direction, we explore the robustness of multi-domain representation by performing the early fusion over a wide set of temporal, spectral and tempo-spectral handcrafted features, followed by training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In our second approach, using a contrastive loss function we learn a latent space from Mel Filter Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) where representations belonging to samples having similar cough characteristics are closer. This helps learn representations for the highly varied COVID-negative class (healthy and symptomatic COVID-negative), by learning multiple smaller clusters. Using only the DiCOVA data, multi-domain features yields an absolute improvement of 0.74% and 1.07%, whereas our second approach shows an improvement of 2.09% and 3.98%, over the blind test and validation set, respectively, when compared with challenge baseline",

The adult male vocal tract was most often used as a model in the past because of the limited availability of physical models, but discussions on different vocal tract sizes were ongoing. Therefore, we focused on downsizing the vocal-tract models in this study, especially the straight models. We reduced the cross-sectional area function for the sliding three-tube model (including the total length) to female adult and child sizes. Furthermore, we created fixed straight models of similar dimensions for the five Japanese vowels. We found that the intelligibility of each model was preserved as long as the ratios of the cross-sectional areas were maintained even if the cross-sections were less than the average human sizes. This indicates that we can reduce the cost of manufacturing the models, as cost is typically a barrier when the models are used for pedagogical purposes",

Besides fundamental frequency, intensity and duration, speakers could use voice quality parameters to disambiguate between ironic and literal utterances. How these paraverbal cues are used to mark irony appears to be language- and/or culture-specific. Since the role of voice quality in ironic utterances has not yet been investigated in Austrian German, the present study addresses this issue. In addition to the acoustic signal, the vocal fold vibration is recorded via electroglottography (EGG). The detailed analysis of the EGG data as well as the acoustic data, provides insight into voice quality characteristics of ironic and literal realisations of short utterances. The analyses reveal that, in Standard Austrian German, some differences in voice quality exist between ironic and literal realisations of utterances: When being ironic, speakers' voices tend to be breathier, creakier or rougher. Differences are more pronounced in the older age group and in male speakers",

Employing read speech materials in German, we quantify the role of CPP alone and in combination with other acoustic cues marking prominence, namely intensity, duration and fundamental frequency. While CPP, by itself, had a significant effect on the perceived prominence for most of the listeners, when used in conjunction with the other cues, its impact was reduced.

    "title": "Automatic Classification of Phonation Types in Spontaneous Speech: Towards a New Workflow for the Characterization of Speakers' Voice Quality",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Voice quality is known to be an important factor for the characterization of a speaker's voice, both in terms of physiological features (mainly laryngeal and supralaryngeal) and of the speaker's habits (sociolinguistic factors). This paper is devoted to one of the main components of voice quality: phonation type. It proposes neural representations of speech followed by a cascade of two binary neural network-based classifiers, one dedicated to the detection of modal and nonmodal vowels, and one for the classification of nonmodal vowels into creaky and breathy types. This approach is evaluated on the spontaneous part of the PTSVOX database, following an expert manual labelling of the data by phonation type. The results of the proposed classifiers reaches on average 85%accuracy at the frame-level and up to 95% accuracy at the segment-level. Further research is planned to generalize the classifiers on more contexts and speakers, and thus pave the way for a new workflow aimed at characterizing phonation types",

    "title": "Measuring Voice Quality Parameters After Speaker Pseudonymization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Collecting and sharing speech resources is important for progress in speech science and technology. Often, speech resources cannot be shared because of concerns over the privacy of the speakers, e.g., minors or people with medical conditions. Current technologies for pseudonymizing speech have only been tested on \"standard\" speech for which pseudonymization methods are evaluated on speaker identification risk, intelligibility, and naturalness. For many applications, the important characteristics are para-linguistic aspects of the speech, e.g., voice quality, emotion, or disease progression. Little information is available about the extent to which speaker pseudonymization methods preserve such paralinguistic information. The current study investigates how well voice quality parameters are preserved by an example speech pseudonymization application. Correlations prove to be high between original and pseudonymized recordings for seven acoustic parameters and a composite measure of dysphonia, the Root mean square errors for these parameters were reasonably small. A linear mixed effect model shows a link between the difference between source and target speaker and the size of the absolute difference in the It is argued that new measures of quality are needed for pseudonymized non-standard speech before wide-spread application of pseudonymized speech can be considered in research and clinical practise",

    "abstract": "Dementia places an immeasurable burden on affected individuals and caregivers. In addition to general cognitive decline, dementia has a negative impact on communication. Technical activation systems are thus in high demand, as cognitive activation may help to moderate the decline. However, effective activation requires sustained engagement — which, in turn, first needs to be reliably recognized. In this study, we examine emotional engagement recognition for People with Dementia (PwD) using non-intrusive biosignals resulting from speech communication and facial expressions. PwD suffering from mild to severe dementia used a tablet-based activation system over multiple sessions. We demonstrate that they retained their ability to verbally express emotional engagement even at severe stages of the disease. For recognition of emotional engagement, we propose an architecture of Bidirectional Long-Short-Term-Memory Networks that combines video information with up to three speech-based feature sets (eGeMAPS, ComParE'13, DeepSpectrum). Using data of 24 PwD, we show that adding speech improves recognition performance significantly compared to a video-only model. Interestingly, disease-progression did not appear to have a substantial impact on recognition performance in this sample. We further discuss the opportunities and challenges of detecting emotional engagement from speech in PwD",

While capabilities of machines on this task are progressing, we approach the so far unexplored aspect whether human raters can distinguish COVID-19 positive and negative tested speakers from voice samples, and compare their performance to a machine learning baseline. To account for the challenging symptom similarity between COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, we use a carefully balanced dataset of voice samples, in which COVID-19 positive and negative tested speakers are matched by their symptoms alongside COVID-19 negative speakers without symptoms. Both human raters and the machine struggle to reliably identify COVID-19 positive speakers in our dataset. These results indicate that particular attention should be paid to the distribution of symptoms across all speakers of a dataset when assessing the capabilities of existing systems.

Overall, lexical features, i.e. word complexity, nouns, fillers and hedges, are the most predictive features of speech evaluation scores; in addition to the gender composition of judge panels and opponents. In a combined lexical and demographic feature model, we achieve an R of 0.40. Different lexical features predict speech evaluation scores for male vs. female speakers, and further investigation is necessary to understand whether differential evaluation standards applied across genders.

Then, inspired by speaker adaptive training in speech recognition, additional transformation coefficients are trained with only the PN loss. The transformation coefficients are used to modify the original backbone embedding network in the x-vector extraction process. Furthermore, the random erasing (RE) data augmentation technique is applied to all support samples in each episode to construct positive pairs, and a contrastive loss between the augmented and the original support samples is added to the objective in model training.

We posit that the user's question is answered by the Bayes error-rate. We present a tutorial to show how to compute the error-rate that results when making Bayes decisions with calibrated likelihood ratios, supplied by the verifier, and an hypothesis prior, supplied by the user. For perfect calibration, the Bayes error-rate is upper bounded by min(EER,P,1-P), where EER is the equal-error-rate and P, 1-P are the prior probabilities of the competing hypotheses. The EER represents the accuracy of the verifier, while min(P,1-P) represents the hardness of the classification problem. We further show how the Bayes error-rate can be computed also for non-perfect calibration and how to generalize from error-rate to expected cost. We offer some criticism of decisions made by direct score thresholding. Finally, we demonstrate by analyzing error-rates of the recently published DCA-PLDA speaker verifier",

Two core ideas were explored in this system: (1) Pooling training data of different languages together for multilingual generalization and reducing development cycles; (2) A novel triage mechanism between text-dependent and text-independent models to reduce runtime cost and expected latency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of speaker verification systems at the scale of 46 languages. The problem is framed from the perspective of using a smart speaker device with interactions consisting of a wake-up keyword (text-dependent) followed by a speech query (text-independent). Experimental evidence suggests that training on multiple languages can generalize to unseen varieties while maintaining performance on seen varieties. We also found that it can reduce computational requirements for training models by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, during model inference on English data, we observe that leveraging a triage framework can reduce the number of calls to the more computationally expensive text-independent system by 73% (and reduce latency by 59%) while maintaining an EER no worse than the text-independent setup",

The system is based on neural speaker embeddings from deep neural network-based encoder networks. These encoder networks for acoustic modeling include 2D convolutional residual-like networks that are shown to be effective on the tasks. Specifically, we apply the Squeeze-and-Excitation residual network (SE-ResNet) [2] to model cross-channel inter-dependency information. On short utterances, we observe that SE-ResNet outperforms alternative methods in the text-dependent verification task. The system adopts a joint loss function that combines the additive cosine margin softmax loss [3] with the equidistant triplet-based loss[4]. This loss function results in performance gains with more discriminative speaker embeddings from enhanced intra-class similarity and increased inter-class variances. We also apply speech enhancement and data augmentation to improve data quality and diversity. Even without using model ensembles, the proposed system significantly outperforms the baselines [1] in both tracks of the speaker verification challenge. With fusion of several encoder neural networks, this system is able to achieve further performance improvements consistently.

    "abstract": "Noise robustness is a challenge for speaker recognition systems. To solve this problem, one of the most common approaches is to joint-train a model by using both clean and noisy utterances. However, the gradients calculated on noisy utterances generally contain speaker-irrelevant noisy components, resulting in overfitting for the seen noisy data and poor generalization for the unseen noisy environments. To alleviate this problem, we propose the gradient regularization method to reduce the speaker-irrelevant noisy components by aligning the gradients among the noisy utterances and their clean counterparts. Specifically, the gradients on noisy utterances are forced to follow the directions of the gradients calculated on their clean counterparts, and the gradients across different types of noisy utterances are also aligned to point in similar directions. Since the noise-related components of the gradients can be reduced by the above alignment, the speaker model can be prevented from encoding irrelevant noisy information. To achieve the gradient regularization goals, a novel sequential inner training strategy is also proposed. Experiments on the VoxCeleb1 dataset indicate that our method achieves the best performance in seen and unseen noisy environments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For real-time acoustic echo cancellation in noisy environments, the classical linear adaptive filters (LAFs) can only remove the linear components of acoustic echo. To further attenuate the non-linear echo components and background noise, this paper proposes a deep learning-based residual echo and noise cancellation (RENC) model, where multiple inputs are utilized and weighted by a feature attention module. More specifically, input features extracted from the far-end reference and the echo estimated by the LAF are scaled with time-frequency attention weights, depending on their correlation with the residual interference in LAF's output. Moreover, a scale-independent mean square error and perceptual loss function are further suggested for training the RENC model. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed feature attention module and multi-domain loss function, which achieve an 8.4%, 14.9% and 29.5% improvement in perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) and echo return loss enhancement (ERLE), respectively",

In this work, we present a self-attentive RNN beamformer to further improve our previous RNN-based beamformer by leveraging on the powerful modeling capability of self-attention. Temporal-spatial self-attention module is proposed to better learn the beamforming weights from the speech and noise spatial covariance matrices. The temporal self-attention module could help RNN to learn global statistics of covariance matrices. The spatial self-attention module is designed to attend on the cross-channel correlation in the covariance matrices. Furthermore, a multi-channel input with multi-speaker directional features and multi-speaker speech separation outputs (MIMO) model is developed to improve the inference efficiency. The evaluations demonstrate that our proposed MIMO self-attentive RNN beamformer improves both the automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy and the perceptual estimation of speech quality (PESQ) against prior arts",

Our proposed loss imposes a higher penalty than the original DC when the speaker is assigned incorrectly. The change from DC to M-DC can be easily achieved by rewriting just one term in the loss function of DC, without any other modifications to the network architecture or model parameters. As such, our method has high practicability because it does not affect the original inference part.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Although recent advances in deep learning technology improved automatic speech recognition (ASR), it remains difficult to recognize speech when it overlaps other people's voices. Speech separation or extraction is often used as a front-end to ASR to handle such overlapping speech. However, deep neural network-based speech enhancement can generate ‘processing artifacts' as a side effect of the enhancement, which degrades ASR performance. For example, it is well known that single-channel noise reduction for non-speech noise (non-overlapping speech) often does not improve ASR. Likewise, the processing artifacts may also be detrimental to ASR in some conditions when processing overlapping speech with a separation/extraction method, although it is usually believed that separation/extraction improves ASR. In order to answer the question ‘Do we always have to separate/extract speech from mixtures?', we analyze ASR performance on observed and enhanced speech at various noise and interference conditions, and show that speech enhancement degrades ASR under some conditions even for overlapping speech. Based on these findings, we propose a simple switching algorithm between observed and enhanced speech based on the estimated signal-to-interference ratio and signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrated experimentally that such a simple switching mechanism can improve recognition performance when processing artifacts are detrimental to ASR",

To address this challenge, we explore the use of a transformer architecture — FastSpeech, with explicit duration modelling to learn hard alignments between the phonemes and articulatory movements.

To address this issue, domain adaptation (DA) is one solution and many unsupervised DA methods have been proposed. These methods focus on a scenario of single source domain to single target domain. However, we will face such problem that test data comes from multiple target domains. This problem can be addressed by producing one model per target domain, but this solution is too costly. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised multi-target domain adaption (MTDA) method for ASC, which can adapt to multiple target domains simultaneously and make use of the underlying relation among multiple domains. Specifically, our approach combines traditional adversarial adaptation with two novel discriminator tasks that learns a common subspace shared by all domains. Furthermore, we propose to divide the target domain into the easy-to-adapt and hard-to-adapt domain, which enables the system to pay more attention to hard-to-adapt domain in training.

Often, the voiced speech is regarded as the deterministic component, and the unvoiced speech and additive noise are the stochastic components. Typically, the speech signal is considered stationary within fixed segments of 20–40 ms, but the degree of stationarity varies over time. For decomposing noisy speech into its voiced and unvoiced components, a fixed segmentation may be too crude, and we here propose to adapt the segment length according to the signal local characteristics. The segmentation relies on parameter estimates of a hybrid speech model and the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and log-likelihood criteria as rules for model selection among the possible segment lengths, for voiced and unvoiced speech, respectively. Given the optimal segmentation markers and the estimated statistics, both components are estimated using linear filtering. A codebook-based approach differentiates between unvoiced speech and noise. A better extraction of the components is possible by taking into account the adaptive segmentation, compared to a fixed one. Also, a lower distortion for voiced speech and higher segSNR for both components is possible, as compared to other decomposition methods",

At the syllable level, the effectiveness of perceptual relevant embeddings in the stylized pitch is analyzed by estimating syllabic tones and comparing those with manual tone markings using the Levenshtein distance measure.

The time-rate synchronization between raw speech signal and the articulatory signal is obtained through a decimation process that acts upon each convolution step. Decimation in time thus avoids degradation phenomena observed in the conventional AAI procedure, caused by the need of framing the speech signal to produce a feature sequence that perfectly matches the articulatory data rate. Experimental evidence on the \"Haskins Production Rate Comparison\" corpus demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution, which outperforms a conventional state-of-the-art AAI system leveraging MFCCs with an 20% relative improvement in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) in mismatched speaking rate conditions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Spoken language understanding (SLU) systems translate voice input commands to semantics which are encoded as an intent and pairs of slot tags and values. Most current SLU systems deploy a cascade of two neural models where the first one maps the input audio to a transcript (ASR) and the second predicts the intent and slots from the transcript (NLU). In this paper, we introduce FANS, a new end-to-end SLU model that fuses an ASR audio encoder to a multi-task NLU decoder to infer the intent, slot tags, and slot values directly from a given input audio, obviating the need for transcription. FANS consists of a shared audio encoder and three decoders, two of which are seq-to-seq decoders that predict non null slot tags and slot values in parallel and in an auto-regressive manner. FANS neural encoder and decoders architectures are flexible which allows us to leverage different combinations of LSTM, self-attention, and attenders. Our experiments show compared to the state-of-the-art end-to-end SLU models, FANS reduces ICER and IRER errors relatively by 30% and 7%, respectively, when tested on an in-house SLU dataset and by 0.86% and 2% absolute when tested on a public SLU dataset",

    "abstract": "Human-computer interaction (HCI) is significantly impacted by delayed responses from a spoken dialogue system. Hence, end-to-end (e2e) spoken language understanding (SLU) solutions have recently been proposed to decrease latency. Such approaches allow for the extraction of semantic information directly from the speech signal, thus bypassing the need for a transcript from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In this paper, we propose a compact e2e SLU architecture for streaming scenarios, where chunks of the speech signal are processed continuously to predict intent and slot values. Our model is based on a 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and a unidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). We compare the performance of two alignment-free losses: the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) method and its adapted version, namely connectionist temporal localization (CTL). The latter performs not only the classification but also localization of sequential audio events. The proposed solution is evaluated on the Fluent Speech Command dataset and results show our model ability to process incoming speech signal, reaching accuracy as high as 98.97% for CTC and 98.78% for CTL on single-label classification, and as high as 95.69% for CTC and 95.28% for CTL on two-label prediction",

    "abstract": "The success of interactive dialog systems is usually associated with the quality of the spoken language understanding (SLU) task, which mainly identifies the corresponding dialog acts and slot values in each turn. By treating utterances in isolation, most SLU systems often overlook the semantic context in which a dialog act is expected. The act dependency between turns is nontrivial and yet critical to the identification of the correct semantic representations. Previous works with limited context awareness have exposed the inadequacy of dealing with complexity in multiproned user intents, which are subject to spontaneous change during turn transitions. In this work, we propose to enhance SLU in multi-turn dialogs, employing a context-aware hierarchical BERT fusion Network (CaBERT-SLU) to not only discern context information within a dialog but also jointly identify multiple dialog acts and slots in each utterance.

In this paper, we investigate the importance of dialog history and how it can be effectively integrated into end-to-end SLU systems.

We encode the dialog history as BERT embeddings, and use them as an additional input to the SLU model along with the speech features for the current utterance.

Spoken intent prediction, for example, combines automatic speech recognition and natural language understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, typically hold out examples for only the surface-level sub-task. As a result, models with similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility functions. Given a dataset for a decomposable task, our method optimally creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing natural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10% between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development. We release our splits and tools for the community",

During the training of end-to-end ASR, data augmentation is a quite effective technique for regularizing the neural networks. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation technique based on semantic transposition of the transcriptions via syntax rules for end-to-end Mandarin ASR. Specifically, we first segment the transcriptions based on part-of-speech tags. Then transposition strategies, such as placing the object in front of the subject or swapping the subject and the object, are applied on the segmented sentences. Finally, the acoustic features corresponding to the transposed transcription are reassembled based on the audio-to-text forced-alignment produced by a pre-trained ASR system. The combination of original data and augmented one is used for training a new ASR system. The experiments are conducted on the Transformer[2] and Conformer[3] based ASR. The results show that the proposed method can give consistent performance gain to the system.

    "abstract": "Accent variability has posed a huge challenge to automatic speech recognition (ASR) modeling. Although one-hot accent vector based adaptation systems are commonly used, they require prior knowledge about the target accent and cannot handle unseen accents. Furthermore, simply concatenating accent embeddings does not make good use of accent knowledge, which has limited improvements. In this work, we aim to tackle these problems with a novel layer-wise adaptation structure injected into the E2E ASR model encoder. The adapter layer encodes an arbitrary accent in the accent space and assists the ASR model in recognizing accented speech. Given an utterance, the adaptation structure extracts the corresponding accent information and transforms the input acoustic feature into an accent-related feature through the linear combination of all accent bases. We further explore the injection position of the adaptation layer, the number of accent bases, and different types of accent bases to achieve better accent adaptation.

To reliably perform continuous on-device learning, it is important for the training process to be completely autonomous without manual intervention. Our simulation studies show that training over many rounds may eventually lead to a significant model drift if the personalized model is indiscriminately accepted at the end of each training round. It is important to have appropriate acceptance criteria in place to guard the model against drifting. Moreover, for storage efficiency, it is desirable to persist the model weights in quantized form. We found that quantizing and dequantizing the model weights in between training rounds can prevent the model from learning effectively. This issue can be circumvented by adding noise to the quantized weights at the start of each training round",

Multilingual phonetic recognition systems mitigate data sparsity issues by training models on data from multiple languages and learning a speech-to-phone or speech-to-text model universal to all languages. However, despite their good performance on the seen training languages, multilingual systems have poor performance on unseen languages. This paper argues that in the real world, even an unseen language has metadata: linguists can tell us the language name, its language family and, usually, its phoneme inventory. Even with no transcribed speech, it is possible to train a language embedding using only data from language typologies (phylogenetic node and phoneme inventory) that reduces ASR error rates. Experiments on a 20-language corpus show that our methods achieve phonetic token error rate (PTER) reduction on all the unseen test languages. An ablation study shows that using the wrong language embedding usually harms PTER if the two languages are from different language families. However, even the wrong language embedding often improves PTER if the language embedding belongs to another member of the same language family",

We hierarchically decompose the conformer transducer and compare adapting each component through fine-tuning. Among various interesting observations, there are three distinct findings: First, adapting the self-attention can achieve more than 80% gain of the full network adaptation. When the adaptation data is extremely scarce, attention is all you need to adapt. Second, within the self-attention, adapting the value projection outperforms adapting the key or the query projection. Lastly, bias adaptation, despite of its compact parameter space, is surprisingly effective. We conduct experiments on a state-of-the-art conformer transducer for an email dictation task. With 3 to 5 min source speech and 200 minute personalized TTS speech, the best performing encoder and joint network adaptation yields 38.37% and 19.90% relative word error rate (WER) reduction.

Results and analysis have shown that the pronunciation dictionary extension is effective in improving WER performance for non-native speech recognition.

The poor quality of dysarthric speech can be greatly improved by statistical VC, but as the normal speech utterances of a dysarthria patient are nearly impossible to collect, previous work failed to recover the individuality of the patient. In light of this, we suggest a novel, two-stage approach for DVC, which is highly flexible in that no normal speech of the patient is required. First, a powerful parallel sequence-to-sequence model converts the input dysarthric speech into a normal speech of a reference speaker as an intermediate product, and a nonparallel, frame-wise VC model realized with a variational autoencoder then converts the speaker identity of the reference speech back to that of the patient while assumed to be capable of preserving the enhanced quality. We investigate several design options.

    "abstract": "Voice conversion (VC) is a technique that converts speaker-dependent non-linguistic information into that of another speaker, while retaining the linguistic information of the input speech. A typical VC system comprises two modules: an encoder module that removes speaker individuality from the input speech and a decoder module that incorporates another speaker's individuality in synthesized speech. This paper proposes a training method for a vocoder-free any-to-many encoder-decoder VC model with limited data. Various pre-training techniques have been proposed to solve problems training to limited training data; some of these techniques employ the text-to-speech (TTS) task for pre-training. We pre-train the decoder module in the voice conversion task for growing our pre-training technique into continuously adding target speakers to the VC system. The experimental results show that good conversion performance can be achieved by conducting VC-based pre-training.

Existing work generally ignores the correlation between different speech representations during training, which causes leakage of content information into the speaker representation and thus degrades VC performance. To alleviate this issue, we employ vector quantization (VQ) for content encoding and introduce mutual information (MI) as the correlation metric during training, to achieve proper disentanglement of content, speaker and pitch representations, by reducing their inter-dependencies in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results reflect the superiority of the proposed method in learning effective disentangled speech representations for retaining source linguistic content and intonation variations, while capturing target speaker characteristics.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary voice conversion, also referred to as zero-shot voice conversion, has recently attracted increased attention in the literature. Although disentangling the linguistic and style representations for acoustic features is an effective way to achieve zero-shot voice conversion, the problem of how to convert to a natural speaker style is challenging because of the intrinsic variabilities of speech and the difficulties of completely decoupling them. For this reason, in this paper, we propose a Two-Pathway Style Embedding Voice Conversion framework (TPSE-VC) for realistic and natural speech conversion. The novel feature of this method is to simultaneously embed sentence-level and phoneme-level style information. A novel attention mechanism is proposed to implement the implicit alignment for timbre style and phoneme content, further embedding a phoneme-level style representation. In addition, we consider embedding the complete set of time steps of audio style into a fixed-length vector to obtain the sentence-level style representation. Moreover, TPSEVC does not require any pre-trained models, and is only trained with non-parallel speech data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TPSE-VC outperforms the state-of-the-art results on zero-shot voice conversion",

Non-parallel VC is usually achieved by firstly disentangling linguistic and speaker representations, and then concatenating the linguistic content with the learned target speaker's embedding at the conversion stage. While such a concatenation-based approach could introduce speaker-specific characteristics into the network, it is not very effective as it entirely relies on the network to learn to combine the linguistic content and the speaker characteristics. Inspired by X-vectors, where the statistics of hidden representation such as means and standard deviations are used for speaker differentiation, we propose a statistics replacement layer in VC systems to directly modify the hidden states to have the target speaker's statistics. The speaker-specific statistics of hidden states are learned for each target speaker during training and are used as guidance for the statistics replacement layer during inference. Moreover, to better concentrate the speaker information into the statistics of hidden representation, a multitask training with X-vector based speaker classification is also performed. Experimental results with Librispeech and VCTK datasets show that the proposed method can effectively improve the converted speech's naturalness and similarity",

Moreover, source speaker and target speaker do not need to be seen during training.

In this paper, we propose a deep discriminative speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding from one utterance more effectively. Specifically, the speaker encoder first integrates residual network and squeeze-and-excitation network to extract discriminative speaker information in frame level by modeling frame-wise and channel-wise interdependence in features. Then attention mechanism is introduced to further emphasize speaker related information via assigning different weights to frame level speaker information. Finally a statistic pooling layer is used to aggregate weighted frame level speaker information to form utterance level speaker embedding.

This raises important questions about whether these recordings are comparable to those made in traditional lab-based settings. Some previous studies have compared the viability of recordings made with personal devices for the clinical evaluation of voice quality. However, these studies rely on simple statistical analyses and do not examine acoustic correlates of voice quality typically examined in the (socio-) phonetic literature (e.g. H1-H2). In this study, we compare recordings from a set of smartphones/laptops and a solid-state recorder to assess the reliability of a range of acoustic correlates of voice quality. The results show significant differences for many acoustic measures of voice quality across devices. Further exploratory analyses demonstrate that these differences are not simple offsets, but rather that their magnitude depends on the value of the measurement of interest. We therefore urge researchers to exercise caution when examining voice quality based on recordings made with participants' devices, particularly when interested in small effect sizes.

    "abstract": "Non-invasive measures of voice quality, such as H1-H2, rely on oral flow signals, inverse filtered speech signals, or corrections for the effects of formants. Voice quality measures play especially important roles in the assessment of voice disorders and the evaluation of treatment efficacy. One type of treatment that is increasingly common in voice therapy, as well as in voice training for singers and actors, is semi-occluded vocal tract exercises (SOVTEs). The goal of SOVTEs is to change patterns of vocal fold vibration and thereby improve voice quality and vocal efficiency. Accelerometers applied to the skin of the neck have been used to investigate subglottal acoustics, to inverse-filter speech signals, and to obtain voice quality metrics. This paper explores the application of neck-skin accelerometers to measure voice quality without oral flow, inverse filtering, or formant correction. Accelerometer-based measures (uncorrected K1-K2 and corrected K1*-K2*, analogous to microphone-based H1-H2 and H1*-H2*) were obtained from typically developing children with healthy voice, before and during SOVTEs. Traditional microphone-based H1-H2 measures (corrected and uncorrected) were also obtained.

Motor severity (captured via motor score) is a key component in assessing overall HD severity. However, motor score evaluation involves in-clinic visits with a trained medical professional, which are expensive and not always accessible. Speech analysis provides an attractive avenue for tracking HD severity because speech is easy to collect remotely and provides insight into motor changes. HD speech is typically characterized as having irregular articulation. With this in mind, acoustic features that can capture vocal tract movement and articulatory coordination are particularly promising for characterizing motor symptom progression in HD. In this paper, we present an experiment that uses Vocal Tract Coordination (VTC) features extracted from read speech to estimate a motor score. When using an elastic-net regression model, we find that VTC features significantly outperform other acoustic features across varied-length audio segments, which highlights the effectiveness of these features for both short- and long-form reading tasks. Lastly, we analyze the F-value scores of VTC features to visualize which channels are most related to motor score. This work enables future research efforts to consider VTC features for acoustic analyses which target HD motor symptomatology tracking",

    "abstract": "We propose a technique to compute spectrograms using Frequency Domain Linear Prediction (FDLP) that uses all-pole models to fit the squared Hilbert envelope of speech in different frequency sub-bands. The spectrogram of a complete speech utterance is computed by overlap-add of contiguous all-pole model responses. A long context window of 1.5 seconds allows us to capture the low frequency temporal modulations of speech in the spectrogram. For an end-to-end automatic speech recognition task, the FDLP spectrogram performs on par with the standard mel spectrogram features for clean read speech training and test data. For more realistic speech data with train-test domain mismatches or reverberations, FDLP spectrogram shows up to 25% and 22% relative WER improvements over mel spectrogram respectively",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unlike traditional (hybrid) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), end-to-end ASR systems simplify the training procedure by directly mapping acoustic features to sequences of graphemes or characters, thereby eliminating the need for specialized acoustic, language, or pronunciation models. However, one drawback of end-to-end ASR systems is that they require more training data than conventional ASR systems to achieve similar word error rate (WER). This makes it difficult to develop ASR systems for tasks where transcribed target data is limited such as developing ASR for Second Language (L2) speakers of Swedish. Nonetheless, recent advancements in self-supervised acoustic learning, manifested in wav2vec models [1, 2, 3], leverage the available untranscribed speech data to provide compact acoustic representation that can achieve low WER when incorporated in end-to-end systems. To this end, we experiment with several monolingual and cross-lingual self-supervised acoustic models to develop end-to-end ASR system for L2 Swedish. Even though our test is very small, it indicates that these systems are competitive in performance with traditional ASR pipeline. Our best model seems to reduce the WER by 7% relative to our traditional ASR baseline trained on the same target data",

Articulation rate and measures of f0 level, range and variability were measured in 40 prosodic phrases per speaker in each condition. Analyses of LME models did not reveal a significant global effect of time throughout the interaction on the distance between speakers (convergence) in any of the examined parameters, or that of preceding phrase value on the subsequent turn-initial value (synchrony). However, more consistent patterns were observed when speaker pairs were examined separately, revealing substantial individual variation on the one hand and non-linear effects on the other.

This study is of Gheg Albanian, a dialect spoken in and around the capital Tirana. Two features were investigated: rounding of /a/ and vowel length contrasts. Two groups of adults and children were compared: one from Tirana and one from a nearby village. Additionally, the children were recorded twice over a period of 12 months and were compared longitudinally. The results showed that length contrasts were still present in both communities and age groups.

We investigate the phonetic realization of the rhotic and lateral phonemes in a Bantu language, Ruruuli. The acoustic space used for rhotics and laterals in this language is extremely similar, although the density peaks in terms of formant values are different. Formant values as well as formant ratios can be reliably used to distinguish between rhotics and laterals. In common with many other languages, an asymmetry between laterals and rhotics is found in Ruruuli, with laterals being more positionally constrained than rhotics.

Productions of /t/ and /d/ were elicited in four domain-initial prosodic positions corresponding to progressively higher-level boundaries: syllable, word, intermediate phrase, and Intonational Phrase. A fifth position, nuclear word, was included in order to better situate it within the prosodic hierarchy. Acoustic correlates of articulatory strength were measured, including closure duration for /d/ and /t/, as well as voice onset time and burst energy for /t/. Our results show that closure duration increases cumulatively from syllable to intermediate phrase, while voice onset time and burst energy are not influenced by boundary strength. These findings provide corroborating evidence for Ipek & Jun's model, particularly for the distinction between word and intermediate phrase boundaries.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition systems deteriorate in presence of overlapped speech. A popular approach to alleviate this is target speech extraction. The extraction system is usually trained with a loss function measuring the discrepancy between the estimated and the reference target speech. This often leads to distortions to the target signal which is detrimental to the recognition accuracy. Additionally, it is necessary to have the strong supervision provided by parallel data consisting of speech mixtures and single-speaker signals. We propose an auxiliary loss function for retraining the target speech extraction. It is composed of two parts: first, a speaker identity loss, forcing the estimated speech to have correct speaker characteristics, and second, a mixture consistency loss, making the extracted sources sum back to the original mixture. The only supervision required for the proposed loss is speaker characteristics obtained from several segments spoken by the target speaker. Such weak supervision makes the loss suitable for adapting the system directly on real recordings. We show that the proposed loss yields signals more suitable for speech recognition and further, we can gain additional improvements by adaptation to target data. Overall, we can reduce the word error rate on LibriCSS dataset from 27.4% to 24.0%",

First, we formulate four speaker extraction conditions to cover the typical scenarios of everyday conversations with one and two talkers.

Our approach utilizes x-vectors as input features so that, within the subsequent pipeline stages, these embedding instances can also directly be employed for speaker diarization and recognition. The x-vectors are extracted by feed-forward sequential memory network (FSMN), allowing for modeling long-time dependencies; they thus form an input into a computationally undemanding binary classifier, whose output is smoothed by a decoder. Evaluation is performed on the standardized QUT-NOISE-TIMIT dataset as well as on broadcast data with large portions of music and background noise.

Next, the attention mechanism summarizes the extracted information into a compact feature vector without losing critical information.

Experiments on simulated overlapping speech using WSJ corpus show that the attention solution is shown to improve the performance by almost 3% absolute over conventional temporal average pooling.

However, for real-world applications where the distribution of different language data is highly imbalanced, the performance of existing LID systems is still far from satisfactory. This raises the challenge of In this paper, we propose an effective weight moving average (WMA) based alternate decoupled learning algorithm, termed WADCL, for long-tailed LID. The system is divided into two components, a frontend feature extractor and a backend classifier. These are then alternately learned in an end-to-end manner using different sampling schemes to alleviate the distribution mismatch between training and test datasets. Furthermore, our WMA method aims to mitigate the side-effects of re-sampling schemes, by fusing the model parameters learned along the trajectory of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed WADCL algorithm, we evaluate and compare several systems over a language dataset constructed to match a long-tailed distribution based on real world application [1].

The proposed framework is not only more compact but can also yield comparable or even better results than standalone systems. Specifically, we found that the overall performance is predominantly determined by the ASR task, and the E2E-based ASR pretraining is essential to achieve improved performance, particularly for the AR task. Additionally, we conduct several analyses of the proposed method. First, though the objective loss for the AR task is much smaller compared with its counterpart of ASR task, a smaller weighting factor with the AR task in the joint objective function is necessary to yield better results for each task. Second, we found that sharing only a few layers of the encoder yields better AR results than sharing the overall encoder. Experimentally, the proposed method produces WER results close to the best standalone E2E ASR ones, while it achieves 7.7% and 4.2% relative improvement over standalone and single-task-based joint recognition methods on test set for accent recognition respectively",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Ao is an under-resourced Tibeto-Burman tonal language spoken in Nagaland, India. There are three distinct dialects of the language, namely, Chungli, Mongsen and Changki. The objective of dialect identification is to identify one dialect from the other within the same language family. The goal of this study is to ascertain the potential of excitation source features for automatic dialect identification in Ao. In this direction, Integrated Linear Prediction Residual (ILPR), an approximate representation of source signal, is explored. The log Mel spectrogram of ILPR ( ) signal is used to exploit the time-frequency characteristics of the excitation source. This work proposes attention based CNN-BiGRU architecture for automatic dialect identification tasks. Additionally, log Mel spectrogram ( ), extracted from the pre-emphasized speech signal, is used as a baseline method. The ( ) contains the vocal-tract characteristics of the speech signal. A significant performance improvement of (nearly) 6% accuracy is observed when the excitation source feature ( ) is combined with the vocal tract representation ( ). To analyse the effect of segment duration, dialect identification performance is reported for three different durations, viz., 1 sec, 3 sec and 6 sec. The effect of gender in dialect identification task for Ao is also studied in this work",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Cross-lingual transfer of knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages is an important research problem in automatic speech recognition (ASR). We propose a new strategy of transfer learning by pretraining using large amounts of speech in the high-resource language but with its text transliterated to the target low-resource language. This simple mapping of scripts explicitly encourages increased sharing between the output spaces of both languages and is surprisingly effective even when the high-resource and low-resource languages are from unrelated language families. The utility of our proposed technique is more evident in very low-resource scenarios, where better initializations are more beneficial. We evaluate our technique on a transformer ASR architecture and the state-of-the-art wav2vec2.0 ASR architecture, with English as the high-resource language and six languages as low-resource targets. With access to 1 hour of target speech, we obtain relative WER reductions of up to 8.2% compared to existing transfer-learning approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper tackles automatically discovering phone-like acoustic units (AUD) from unlabeled speech data. Past studies usually proposed single-step approaches. We propose a two-stage approach: the first stage learns a subword-discriminative feature representation, and the second stage applies clustering to the learned representation and obtains phone-like clusters as the discovered acoustic units. In the first stage, a recently proposed method in the task of unsupervised subword modeling is improved by replacing a monolingual out-of-domain (OOD) ASR system with a multilingual one to create a subword-discriminative representation that is more language-independent. In the second stage, segment-level k-means is adopted, and two methods to represent the variable-length speech segments as fixed-dimension feature vectors are compared. Experiments on a very low-resource Mboshi language corpus show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art AUD in both normalized mutual information (NMI) and F-score. The multilingual ASR improved upon the monolingual ASR in providing OOD phone labels and in estimating the phone boundaries. A comparison of our systems with and without knowing the ground-truth phone boundaries showed a 16% NMI performance gap, suggesting that the current approach can significantly benefit from improved phone boundary estimation",

    "abstract": "We investigate segmenting and clustering speech into low-bitrate phone-like sequences without supervision. We specifically constrain pretrained self-supervised vector-quantized (VQ) neural networks so that blocks of contiguous feature vectors are assigned to the same code, thereby giving a variable-rate segmentation of the speech into discrete units. Two segmentation methods are considered. In the first, features are greedily merged until a prespecified number of segments are reached. The second uses dynamic programming to optimize a squared error with a penalty term to encourage fewer but longer segments. We show that these VQ segmentation methods can be used without alteration across a wide range of tasks: unsupervised phone segmentation, ABX phone discrimination, same-different word discrimination, and as inputs to a symbolic word segmentation algorithm. The penalized dynamic programming method generally performs best. While performance on individual tasks is only comparable to the state-of-the-art in some cases, in all tasks a reasonable competing approach is outperformed at a substantially lower bitrate",

Among those methods, SimCLR greatly advanced the state of the art in self-supervised and semi-supervised learning on ImageNet. The input feature representations for speech and visual tasks are both continuous, so it is natural to consider applying similar objective on speech representation learning. In this paper, we propose Speech SimCLR, a new self-supervised objective for speech representation learning. During training, Speech SimCLR applies augmentation on raw speech and its spectrogram. Its objective is the combination of contrastive loss that maximizes agreement between differently augmented samples in the latent space and reconstruction loss of input representation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Acoustic word embedding models map variable duration speech segments to fixed dimensional vectors, enabling efficient speech search and discovery. Previous work explored how embeddings can be obtained in zero-resource settings where no labelled data is available in the target language. The current best approach uses transfer learning: a single supervised multilingual model is trained using labelled data from multiple well-resourced languages and then applied to a target zero-resource language (without fine-tuning). However, it is still unclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream performance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training languages related to the target. Using data from eleven languages spoken in Southern Africa, we experiment with adding data from different language families while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word discrimination and query-by-example search evaluations, we show that training on languages from the same family gives large improvements. Through finer-grained analysis, we show that training on even just a single related language gives the largest gain. We also find that adding data from unrelated languages generally doesn't hurt performance",
