    "title": "Approximation Bounds for Hierarchical Clustering: Average Linkage, Bisecting K-means, and Local Search",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Hierarchical clustering is a data analysis method that has been used for decades. Despite its widespread use, the method has an underdeveloped analytical foundation. Having a well-understood foundation would both support the currently used methods and help guide future improvements. The goal of this paper is to give an analytic framework to better understand observations seen in practice. This paper considers the dual of a problem framework for hierarchical clustering introduced by Dasgupta. The main result is that one of the most popular algorithms used in practice, average linkage agglomerative clustering, has a small constant approximation ratio for this objective. To contrast, this paper establishes that using several other popular algorithms, including bisecting $k$-means divisive clustering, have a very poor lower bound on its approximation ratio for the same objective. However, we show that there are divisive algorithms that perform well with respect to this objective by giving two constant approximation algorithms. This paper is some of the first work to establish guarantees on widely used hierarchical algorithms for a natural objective function. This objective and analysis give insight into what these popular algorithms are optimizing and when they will perform well",

    "title": "The Brier Score under Administrative Censoring: Problems and a Solution",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The Brier score is commonly used for evaluating probability predictions. In survival analysis, with right-censored observations of the event times, this score can be weighted by the inverse probability of censoring (IPCW) to retain its original interpretation. It is common practice to estimate the censoring distribution with the Kaplan-Meier estimator, even though it assumes that the censoring distribution is independent of the covariates. This paper investigates problems that may arise for the IPCW weighting scheme when the covariates used in the prediction model contain information about the censoring times. In particular, this may occur for administratively censored data if the distribution of the covariates varies with calendar time. For administratively censored data, we propose an alternative version of the Brier score. This administrative Brier score does not require estimation of the censoring distribution and is valid also when the censoring times can be predicted from the covariates",

    "title": "Bayesian Spiked Laplacian Graphs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In network analysis, it is common to work with a collection of graphs that exhibit heterogeneity. For example, neuroimaging data from patient cohorts are increasingly available. A critical analytical task is to identify communities, and graph Laplacian-based methods are routinely used. However, these methods are currently limited to a single network and also do not provide measures of uncertainty on the community assignment. In this work, we first propose a probabilistic network model called the \"Spiked Laplacian Graph\" that considers an observed network as a transform of the Laplacian and degree matrices of the network generating process, with the Laplacian eigenvalues modeled by a modified spiked structure. This effectively reduces the number of parameters in the eigenvectors, and their sign patterns allow efficient estimation of the underlying community structure. Further, the posterior distribution of the eigenvectors provides uncertainty quantification for the community estimates. Second, we introduce a Bayesian non-parametric approach to address the issue of heterogeneity in a collection of graphs. Theoretical results are established on the posterior consistency of the procedure and provide insights on the trade-off between model resolution and accuracy. We illustrate the performance of the methodology on synthetic data sets, as well as a neuroscience study related to brain activity in working memory",

The bounded-improvement model seeks a classifier with a guaranteed selective risk and maximal cover. The bounded-abstention model seeks a classifier with guaranteed cover and minimal selective risk. We prove that despite their different formulations the three rejection models lead to the same prediction strategy: the Bayes classifier endowed with a randomized Bayes selection function. We define the notion of a proper uncertainty score as a scalar summary of the prediction uncertainty sufficient to construct the randomized Bayes selection function.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The count-min sketch (CMS) is a time and memory efficient randomized data structure that provides estimates of tokens' frequencies in a data stream of tokens, i.e. point queries, based on random hashed data. A learning-augmented version of the CMS, referred to as CMS-DP, has been proposed by Cai, Mitzenmacher and Adams (NeurIPS 2018), and it relies on Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) modeling of the data stream of tokens via a Dirichlet process (DP) prior, with estimates of a point query being that are obtained as mean functionals of the posterior distribution of the point query, given the hashed data. While the CMS-DP has proved to improve on some aspects of CMS, it has the major drawback of arising from a \"constructive\" proof that builds upon arguments that are tailored to the DP prior, namely arguments that are not usable for other nonparametric priors. In this paper, we present a \"Bayesian\" proof of the CMS-DP that has the main advantage of building upon arguments that are usable under the popular Pitman-Yor process (PYP) prior, which generalizes the DP prior by allowing for a more flexible tail behaviour, ranging from geometric tails to heavy power-law tails. This result leads to develop a novel learning-augmented CMS under power-law data streams, referred to as CMS-PYP, which relies on BNP modeling of the data stream of tokens via a PYP prior. Under this more general framework, we apply the arguments of the \"Bayesian\" proof of the CMS-DP, suitably adapted to the PYP prior, in order to compute the posterior distribution of a point query, given the hashed data. Applications to synthetic data and real textual data show that the CMS-PYP outperforms the CMS and the CMS-DP in estimating low-frequency tokens, which are known to be of critical interest in textual data, and it is competitive with respect to a variation of the CMS designed to deal with the estimation of low-frequency tokens.

In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic framework to generalize and extend adversarial attacks in order to produce a desired probability distribution for the classes when we apply the attack method to a large number of inputs. This novel attack paradigm provides the adversary with greater control over the target model, thereby exposing, in a wide range of scenarios, threats against deep learning models that cannot be conducted by the conventional paradigms. We introduce four different strategies to efficiently generate such attacks, and illustrate our approach by extending multiple adversarial attack algorithms. We also experimentally validate our approach for the spoken command classification task and the Tweet emotion classification task, two exemplary machine learning problems in the audio and text domain, respectively.

Then, the assumption that the conditional distribution of response $Y$ given features $X$ is the same for all samples may not hold. Furthermore, in scientific applications, the covariance structure of the features may contain important signals and its learning is also affected by latent group structure. We propose a class of mixture models for paired data $(X,Y)$ that couples together the distribution of $X$ (using sparse graphical models) and the conditional $Y \\! \\mid \\!

Although recent studies have characterized the convergence rate for several such popular algorithms, it is still unclear how much further these convergence rates can be improved. In this paper, we address this fundamental question from two perspectives. First, we provide the first-known lower complexity bounds of $\\widetilde \\Omega\\bigg(\\sqrt{\\frac{L_y\\widetilde L_{xy}^2}{\\mu_x\\mu_y^2}}\\bigg)$ and $\\widetilde \\Omega\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}}\\min\\{\\kappa_y,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon^{3}}}\\}\\big)$ respectively for strongly-convex-strongly-convex and convex-strongly-convex bilevel optimizations. Second, we propose an accelerated bilevel optimizer named AccBiO, for which we provide the first-known complexity bounds without the gradient boundedness assumption (which was made in existing analyses) under the two aforementioned geometries. We also provide significantly tighter upper bounds than the existing complexity when the bounded gradient assumption does hold. We show that AccBiO achieves the optimal results (i.e., the upper and lower bounds match up to logarithmic factors) when the inner-level problem takes a quadratic form with a constant-level condition number. Interestingly, our lower bounds under both geometries are larger than the corresponding optimal complexities of minimax optimization, establishing that bilevel optimization is provably more challenging than minimax optimization.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Insights into complex, high-dimensional data can be obtained by discovering features of the data that match or do not match a model of interest. To formalize this task, we introduce the \"data selection\" problem: finding a lower-dimensional statistic - such as a subset of variables - that is well fit by a given parametric model of interest. A fully Bayesian approach to data selection would be to parametrically model the value of the statistic, nonparametrically model the remaining \"background\" components of the data, and perform standard Bayesian model selection for the choice of statistic. However, fitting a nonparametric model to high-dimensional data tends to be highly inefficient, statistically and computationally. We propose a novel score for performing data selection, the \"Stein volume criterion (SVC)\", that does not require fitting a nonparametric model. The SVC takes the form of a generalized marginal likelihood with a kernelized Stein discrepancy in place of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We prove that the SVC is consistent for data selection, and establish consistency and asymptotic normality of the corresponding generalized posterior on parameters. We apply the SVC to the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data sets using probabilistic principal components analysis and a spin glass model of gene regulation",

First, we use a deep generative model to learn a representation of the response that has a unimodal distribution. Existing multiple-output quantile regression approaches are effective in such cases, so we apply them on the learned representation, and then transform the solution to the original space of the response. This process results in a flexible and informative region that can have an arbitrary shape, a property that existing methods lack. Second, we propose an extension of conformal prediction to the multivariate response setting that modifies any method to return sets with a pre-specified coverage level. The desired coverage is theoretically guaranteed in the finite-sample case for any distribution. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic data show that our method constructs regions that are significantly smaller compared to existing techniques",

Recently, these methods have been studied using a variational perspective (Betancourt et al., 2018). This has opened up the possibility of introducing variational and symplectic methods using geometric integration. In particular, in this paper, we introduce variational integrators (Marsden and West, 2001) which allow us to derive different methods for optimization. Using both Hamilton's and Lagrange-d'Alembert's principle, we derive two families of optimization methods in one-to-one correspondence that generalize Polyak's heavy ball (Polyak, 1964) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (Nesterov, 1983), the second of which mimics the behavior of the latter reducing the oscillations of classical momentum methods. However, since the systems considered are explicitly time-dependent, the preservation of symplecticity of autonomous systems occurs here solely on the fibers.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many scientific problems require identifying a small set of covariates that are associated with a target response and estimating their effects. Often, these effects are nonlinear and include interactions, so linear and additive methods can lead to poor estimation and variable selection. Unfortunately, methods that simultaneously express sparsity, nonlinearity, and interactions are computationally intractable --- with runtime at least quadratic in the number of covariates, and often worse. In the present work, we solve this computational bottleneck. We show that suitable interaction models have a kernel representation, namely there exists a \"kernel trick\" to perform variable selection and estimation in $O$(# covariates) time. Our resulting fit corresponds to a sparse orthogonal decomposition of the regression function in a Hilbert space (i.e., a functional ANOVA decomposition), where interaction effects represent all variation that cannot be explained by lower-order effects. On a variety of synthetic and real data sets, our approach outperforms existing methods used for large, high-dimensional data sets while remaining competitive (or being orders of magnitude faster) in runtime",

    "title": "Impact of classification difficulty on the weight matrices spectra in Deep Learning and application to early-stopping",
    "volume": "MLOSS",
    "abstract": "Much recent research effort has been devoted to explain the success of deep learning. Random Matrix Theory (RMT) provides an emerging way to this end by analyzing the spectra of large random matrices involved in a trained deep neural network (DNN) such as weight matrices or Hessian matrices in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. To better understand spectra of weight matrices, we conduct extensive experiments on weight matrices under different settings for layers, networks and data sets. Based on the previous work of {martin2018implicit}, spectra of weight matrices at the terminal stage of training are classified into three main types: Light Tail (LT), Bulk Transition period (BT) and Heavy Tail (HT). These different types, especially HT, implicitly indicate some regularization in the DNNs. In this paper, inspired from {martin2018implicit}, we identify the difficulty of the classification problem as an important factor for the appearance of HT in weight matrices spectra. Higher the classification difficulty, higher the chance for HT to appear. Moreover, the classification difficulty can be affected either by the signal-to-noise ratio of the dataset, or by the complexity of the classification problem (complex features, large number of classes) as well. Leveraging on this finding, we further propose a spectral criterion to detect the appearance of HT and use it to early stop the training process without testing data. Such early stopped DNNs have the merit of avoiding overfitting and unnecessary extra training while preserving a much comparable generalization ability. These findings from the paper are validated in several NNs (LeNet, MiniAlexNet and VGG), using Gaussian synthetic data and real data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10)",

    "abstract": "The susceptibility of federated learning (FL) to attacks from untrustworthy endpoints has led to the design of several defense systems. FL defense systems enhance the federated optimization algorithm using anomaly detection, scaling the updates from endpoints depending on their anomalous behavior. However, the defense systems themselves may be exploited by the endpoints with more sophisticated attacks. First, this paper proposes three categories of attacks and shows that they can effectively deceive some well-known FL defense systems. In the first two categories, referred to as on-off attacks, the adversary toggles between being honest and engaging in attacks. We analyse two such on-off attacks, label flipping and free riding, and show their impact against existing FL defense systems. As a third category, we propose attacks based on \"good mouthing\" and \"bad mouthing\", to boost or diminish influence of the victim endpoints on the global model. Secondly, we propose a new federated optimization algorithm, Viceroy, that can successfully mitigate all the proposed attacks. The proposed attacks and the mitigation strategy have been tested on a number of different experiments establishing their effectiveness in comparison with other contemporary methods. The proposed algorithm has also been made available as open source. Finally, in the appendices, we provide an induction proof for the on-off model poisoning attack, and the proof of convergence and adversarial tolerance for the new federated optimization algorithm",

We call this statistic \"sufficiently-labeled data\" and prove its sufficiency and efficiency for finding the optimal hidden representations, on which competent classifier heads can be trained using as few as a single randomly-chosen fully-labeled example per class. Sufficiently-labeled data can be obtained from annotators directly without collecting the fully-labeled data first. And we prove that it is easier to directly obtain sufficiently-labeled data than obtaining fully-labeled data. Furthermore, sufficiently-labeled data is naturally more secure since it stores relative, instead of absolute, information. Extensive experimental results are provided to support our theory",

While most existing methods focus on building principal components (PCs) iteratively through deflation, we propose GeoSPCA, a novel algorithm to build all PCs at once while satisfying the orthogonality constraints which brings substantial benefits over deflation. This novel approach is based on the left eigenvalues of the covariance matrix which helps circumvent the non-convexity of the problem by approximating the optimal solution using a binary linear optimization problem that can find the optimal solution. The resulting approximation can be used to tackle different versions of the sparse PCA problem including the case in which the principal components share the same support or have disjoint supports and the Structured Sparse PCA problem. We also propose optimality bounds and illustrate the benefits of GeoSPCA in selected real world problems both in terms of explained variance, sparsity and tractability. Improvements vs. the greedy algorithm, which is often at par with state-of-the-art techniques, reaches up to 24% in terms of variance while solving real world problems with 10,000s of variables and support cardinality of 100s in minutes.

    "title": "Gap Minimization for Knowledge Sharing and Transfer",

    "abstract": "Learning from multiple related tasks by knowledge sharing and transfer has become increasingly relevant over the last two decades. In order to successfully transfer information from one task to another, it is critical to understand the similarities and differences between the domains. In this paper, we introduce the notion of performance gap, an intuitive and novel measure of the distance between learning tasks. Unlike existing measures which are used as tools to bound the difference of expected risks between tasks (e.g., $\\mathcal{H}$-divergence or discrepancy distance), we theoretically show that the performance gap can be viewed as a data- and algorithm-dependent regularizer, which controls the model complexity and leads to finer guarantees. More importantly, it also provides new insights and motivates a novel principle for designing strategies for knowledge sharing and transfer: gap minimization. We instantiate this principle with two algorithms: 1. gapBoost, a novel and principled boosting algorithm that explicitly minimizes the performance gap between source and target domains for transfer learning; and 2. gapMTNN, a representation learning algorithm that reformulates gap minimization as semantic conditional matching for multitask learning. Our extensive evaluation on both transfer learning and multitask learning benchmark data sets shows that our methods outperform existing baselines",

In particular, we focus on the class of games where the followers are myopically rational; i.e., they aim to maximize their instantaneous rewards. For such a game, our goal is to find a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium (SNE), which is a policy pair $(\\pi^*, \\nu^*)$ such that: (i) $\\pi^*$ is the optimal policy for the leader when the followers always play their best response, and (ii) $\\nu^*$ is the best response policy of the followers, which is a Nash equilibrium of the followers' game induced by $\\pi^*$. We develop sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for solving for an SNE in both online and offline settings. Our algorithms are optimistic and pessimistic variants of least-squares value iteration, and they are readily able to incorporate function approximation tools in the setting of large state spaces. Furthermore, for the case with linear function approximation, we prove that our algorithms achieve sublinear regret and suboptimality under online and offline setups respectively.

How to reduce its uncertainty and leverage its effectiveness is still a challenging task. As two types of representative label ambiguities, Label Distribution Learning (LDL), which annotates each instance with a label distribution, and Emerging New Class (ENC), which focuses on model reusing with new classes, have attached extensive attentions. Nevertheless, in many applications, such as emotion distribution recognition and facial age estimation, we may face a more complicated label ambiguity scenario, i.e., label distribution changing with sample space expanding owing to the new class. To solve this crucial but rarely studied problem, we propose a new framework named as Label Distribution Changing Learning (LDCL) in this paper, together with its theoretical guarantee with generalization error bound. Our approach expands the sample space by re-scaling previous distribution and then estimates the emerging label value via scaling constraint factor. For demonstration, we present two special cases within the framework, together with their optimizations and convergence analyses. Besides evaluating LDCL on most of the existing 13 data sets, we also apply it in the application of emotion distribution recognition. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both tackling label ambiguity problem and estimating facial emotion",

    "abstract": "Solving an ill-posed linear inverse problem requires knowledge about the underlying signal model. In many applications, this model is a priori unknown and has to be learned from data. However, it is impossible to learn the model using observations obtained via a single incomplete measurement operator, as there is no information about the signal model in the nullspace of the operator, resulting in a chicken-and-egg problem: to learn the model we need reconstructed signals, but to reconstruct the signals we need to know the model. Two ways to overcome this limitation are using multiple measurement operators or assuming that the signal model is invariant to a certain group action. In this paper, we present necessary and sufficient sensing conditions for learning the signal model from measurement data alone which only depend on the dimension of the model and the number of operators or properties of the group action that the model is invariant to. As our results are agnostic of the learning algorithm, they shed light into the fundamental limitations of learning from incomplete data and have implications in a wide range set of practical algorithms, such as dictionary learning, matrix completion and deep neural networks",

    "title": "On Batch Teaching Without Collusion",

    "abstract": "Formal models of learning from teachers need to respect certain criteria to avoid collusion. The most commonly accepted notion of collusion-avoidance was proposed by Goldman and Mathias (1996), and various teaching models obeying their criterion have been studied. For each model $M$ and each concept class $\\mathcal{C}$, a parameter $M$-TD$(\\mathcal{C})$ refers to the teaching dimension of concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ in model $M$---defined to be the number of examples required for teaching a concept, in the worst case over all concepts in $\\mathcal{C}$. This paper introduces a new model of teaching, called no-clash teaching, together with the corresponding parameter NCTD$(\\mathcal{C})$. No-clash teaching is provably optimal in the strong sense that, given any concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ and any model $M$ obeying Goldman and Mathias's collusion-avoidance criterion, one obtains NCTD$(\\mathcal{C})\\le M$-TD$(\\mathcal{C})$. We also study a corresponding notion NCTD$^+$ for the case of learning from positive data only, establish useful bounds on NCTD and NCTD$^+$, and discuss relations of these parameters to other complexity parameters of interest in computational learning theory. We further argue that Goldman and Mathias's collusion-avoidance criterion may in some settings be too weak in that it admits certain forms of interaction between teacher and learner that could be considered collusion in practice. Therefore, we introduce a strictly stronger notion of collusion-avoidance and demonstrate that the well-studied notion of Preference-based Teaching is optimal among all teaching schemes that are strongly collusion-avoiding on all finite subsets of a given concept class",

Engineering applications for modeling, characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in real time. Common existing paradigms for dimensionality reduction include linear methods, such as the singular value decomposition (SVD), and nonlinear methods, such as variants of convolutional autoencoders (CAE). However, these encoding techniques lack the ability to efficiently represent the complexity associated with spatio-temporal data, which often requires variable geometry, non-uniform grid resolution, adaptive meshing, and/or parametric dependencies. To resolve these practical engineering challenges, we propose a general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation of large-scale, parametric, spatial-temporal data. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons (MLPs): (i) ShapeNet, which isolates and represents the spatial complexity, and (ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements. We demonstrate the utility of NIF for parametric surrogate modeling, enabling the interpretable representation and compression of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, efficient many-spatial-query tasks, and improved generalization performance for sparse reconstruction",

The most popular approaches to estimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine predictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time, industrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and computational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all the issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study principled approaches to improve the uncertainty property of a single network, based on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty quantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance awareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing example from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that improves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes: (1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz smoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a Gaussian process layer. On a suite of vision and language understanding benchmarks and on modern architectures (Wide-ResNet and BERT), SNGP consistently outperforms other single-model approaches in prediction, calibration and out-of-domain detection. Furthermore, SNGP provides complementary benefits to popular techniques such as deep ensembles and data augmentation, making it a simple and scalable building block for probabilistic deep learning",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the standard toolkit for analyzing and learning from data on graphs. This emerging field has witnessed an extensive growth of promising techniques that have been applied with success to computer science, mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry. But for any successful field to become mainstream and reliable, benchmarks must be developed to quantify progress. This led us in March 2020 to release a benchmark framework that i) comprises of a diverse collection of mathematical and real-world graphs, ii) enables fair model comparison with the same parameter budget to identify key architectures, iii) has an open-source, easy-to use and reproducible code infrastructure, and iv) is flexible for researchers to experiment with new theoretical ideas. As of December 2022, the GitHub repository has reached 2,000 stars and 380 forks, which demonstrates the utility of the proposed open-source framework through the wide usage by the GNN community. In this paper, we present an updated version of our benchmark with a concise presentation of the aforementioned framework characteristics, an additional medium-sized molecular dataset AQSOL, similar to the popular ZINC, but with a real-world measured chemical target, and discuss how this framework can be leveraged to explore new GNN designs and insights. As a proof of value of our benchmark, we study the case of graph positional encoding (PE) in GNNs, which was introduced with this benchmark and has since spurred interest of exploring more powerful PE for Transformers and GNNs in a robust experimental setting",

    "abstract": "Motivated by the exploding growth of web-based services and the importance of efficiently managing the computational resources of such systems, we introduce and study a theoretical model for load balancing of very large databases such as commercial search engines. Our model is a more realistic version of the well-received \\bab model with an additional constraint that limits the number of servers that carry each piece of the data. This additional constraint is necessary when, on one hand, the data is so large that we can not copy the whole data on each server. On the other hand, the query response time is so limited that we can not ignore the fact that the number of queries for each piece of the data changes over time, and hence we can not simply split the data over different machines. In this paper, we develop an almost optimal load balancing algorithm that works given an estimate of the load of each piece of the data. Our algorithm is almost perfectly robust to wrong estimates, to the extent that even when all of the loads are adversarially chosen the performance of our algorithm is $1-1/e$, which is provably optimal. Along the way, we develop various techniques for analyzing the balls-into-bins process under certain correlations and build a novel connection with the multiplicative weights update scheme",

This approach has two main benefits. First, categorical d-separation is a very intuitive criterion based on topological connectedness. Second, our results apply both to measure-theoretic probability (with standard Borel spaces) and beyond probability theory, including to deterministic and possibilistic networks. It therefore provides a clean proof of the equivalence of local and global Markov properties with causal compatibility for continuous and mixed random variables as well as deterministic and possibilistic variables",

We provide state-of-the-art convergence guarantees for SGD under mild conditions and allow a large constant step size at the beginning of training.

However, many real-world problems require optimization of an objective that is non-linear in cumulative rewards for which dynamic programming cannot be applied directly. For example, in a resource allocation problem, one of the objectives is to maximize long-term fairness among the users. We notice that when an agent aim to optimize some function of the sum of rewards is considered, the problem loses its Markov nature. This paper addresses and formalizes the problem of optimizing a non-linear function of the long term average of rewards.

    "abstract": "Density estimation is a building block for many other statistical methods, such as classification, nonparametric testing, and data compression. In this paper, we focus on a non-parametric approach to multivariate density estimation, and study its asymptotic properties under both frequentist and Bayesian settings. The estimated density function is obtained by considering a sequence of approximating spaces to the space of densities. These spaces consist of piecewise constant density functions supported by binary partitions with increasing complexity. To obtain an estimate, the partition is learned by maximizing either the likelihood of the corresponding histogram on that partition, or the marginal posterior probability of the partition under a suitable prior. We analyze the convergence rate of the maximum likelihood estimator and the posterior concentration rate of the Bayesian estimator, and conclude that for a relatively rich class of density functions the rate does not directly depend on the dimension. We also show that the Bayesian method can adapt to the unknown smoothness of the density function. The method is applied to several specific function classes and explicit rates are obtained. These include spatially sparse functions, functions of bounded variation, and H{\\\"o}lder continuous functions. We also introduce an ensemble approach, obtained by aggregating multiple density estimates fit under carefully designed perturbations, and show that for density functions lying in a H{\\\"o}lder space ($\\mathcal{H}^{1, \\beta}, 0 < \\beta \\leq 1$), the ensemble method can achieve minimax convergence rate up to a logarithmic term, while the corresponding rate of the density estimator based on a single partition is suboptimal for this function class",

Our IRL algorithm identifies optimality and then constructs set-valued estimates of the cost function. To achieve this IRL objective, we use novel ideas from Bayesian revealed preferences stemming from microeconomics. We illustrate the proposed IRL scheme using two important examples of stopping time problems, namely, sequential hypothesis testing and Bayesian search. As a real-world example, we illustrate using a YouTube dataset comprising metadata from 190000 videos how the proposed IRL method predicts user engagement in online multimedia platforms with high accuracy.

    "abstract": "We study a multi-round welfare-maximising mechanism design problem in instances where agents do not know their values. On each round, a mechanism first assigns an allocation to a set of agents and charges them a price; at the end of the round, the agents provide (stochastic) feedback to the mechanism for the allocation they received. This setting is motivated by applications in cloud markets and online advertising where an agent may know her value for an allocation only after experiencing it. Therefore, the mechanism needs to explore different allocations for each agent so that it can learn their values, while simultaneously attempting to find the socially optimal set of allocations. Our focus is on truthful and individually rational mechanisms which imitate the classical VCG mechanism in the long run. To that end, we first define three notions of regret for the welfare, the individual utilities of each agent and that of the mechanism. We show that these three terms are interdependent via an $\\Omega(T^{\\frac{2}{3}})$ lower bound for the maximum of these three terms after $T$ rounds of allocations, and describe an algorithm which essentially achieves this rate. Our framework also provides flexibility to control the pricing scheme so as to trade-off between the agent and seller regrets. Next, we define asymptotic variants for the truthfulness and individual rationality requirements and provide asymptotic rates to quantify the degree to which both properties are satisfied by the proposed algorithm",

In this paper, we prove that, in fact, constant step size online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) converges from arbitrary initializations for the non-smooth, non-convex amplitude squared loss objective. In this setting, online SGD is also equivalent to the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm from numerical analysis. Our analysis can easily be generalized to other single index models.

A prime example of this is the influential~ Shap-score, a version of the Shapley value that can help explain the result of a learned model on a specific entity by assigning a score to every feature. While in general computing Shapley values is a computationally intractable problem, we prove a strong positive result stating that the Shap-score can be computed in polynomial time over deterministic and decomposable Boolean circuits under the so-called product distributions on entities. Such circuits are studied in the field of Knowledge Compilation and generalize a wide range of Boolean circuits and binary decision diagrams classes, including binary decision trees, Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs) and Free Binary Decision Diagrams (FBDDs). Our positive result extends even beyond binary classifiers, as it continues to hold if each feature is associated with a finite domain of possible values. We also establish the computational limits of the notion of Shap-score by observing that, under a mild condition, computing it over a class of Boolean models is always polynomially as hard as the model counting problem for that class. This implies that both determinism and decomposability are essential properties for the circuits that we consider, as removing one or the other renders the problem of computing the Shap-score intractable (namely, $\\#P$-hard). It also implies that computing Shap-scores is $\\#P$-hard even over the class of propositional formulas in DNF. Based on this negative result, we look for the existence of fully-polynomial randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS) for computing Shap-scores over such class. In stark contrast to the model counting problem for DNF formulas, which admits an FPRAS, we prove that no such FPRAS exists (under widely believed complexity assumptions) for the computation of Shap-scores. Surprisingly, this negative result holds even for the class of monotone formulas in DNF. These techniques can be further extended to prove another strong negative result: Under widely believed complexity assumptions, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that checks, given a monotone DNF formula $\\varphi$ and features $x,y$, whether the Shap-score of $x$ in $\\varphi$ is smaller than the Shap-score of $y$ in $\\varphi$",

We estimate virtual statistics for data generated by the prior predictive distribution and then optimize over the hyperparameters to learn those for which the virtual statistics match the target values provided by the user or estimated from (a subset of) the observed data. We apply the principle for probabilistic matrix factorization, for which good solutions for prior selection have been missing. We show that for Poisson factorization models we can analytically determine the hyperparameters, including the number of factors, that best replicate the target statistics, and we empirically study the sensitivity of the approach for the model mismatch.

The problem can be alleviated by the explosive sample size in the era of big data, while the large-scale data size presents some challenges in the storage of data and the calculation of estimators. These challenges make the classical nonparametric regression imputation methods no longer applicable. This motivates us to develop two distributed nonparametric regression imputation methods. One is based on kernel smoothing and the other on the sieve method. The kernel-based distributed imputation method has extremely low communication cost, and the sieve-based distributed imputation method can accommodate more local machines. The response mean estimation is considered to illustrate the proposed imputation methods. Two distributed nonparametric regression imputation estimators are proposed for the response mean, which are proved to be asymptotically normal with asymptotic variances achieving the semiparametric efficiency bound.

ROC curves can also be used in other problems with false positive and true positive rates such as changepoint detection. We show that in this more general context, the ROC curve can have loops, points with highly sub-optimal error rates, and AUC greater than one. This observation motivates a new optimization objective: rather than maximizing the AUC, we would like a monotonic ROC curve with AUC=1 that avoids points with large values for Min(FP,FN). We propose an L1 relaxation of this objective that results in a new surrogate loss function called the AUM, short for Area Under Min(FP, FN). Whereas previous loss functions are based on summing over all labeled examples or pairs, the AUM requires a sort and a sum over the sequence of points on the ROC curve. We show that AUM directional derivatives can be efficiently computed and used in a gradient descent learning algorithm. In our empirical study of supervised binary classification and changepoint detection problems, we show that our new AUM minimization learning algorithm results in improved AUC and speed relative to previous baselines",

To this end, we propose a peeling algorithm based on nodewise regressions to establish a topological order of primary variables. Moreover, we prove that the peeling algorithm yields a consistent estimator in low-order polynomial time. Second, we propose a likelihood ratio test integrated with a data perturbation scheme to account for the uncertainty of identifying ancestors and interventions.

We also show that unless the acceptance probability is constant across databases, the runtime of a rejection sampler does not satisfy $\\epsilon$-DP for any $\\epsilon$. We show that there is a similar breakdown in privacy with adaptive rejection samplers. We propose three modifications to the rejection sampling algorithm, with varying assumptions, to protect against timing attacks by making the runtime independent of the data. The modification with the weakest assumptions is an approximate sampler, introducing a small increase in the privacy cost, whereas the other modifications give perfect samplers. We also use our techniques to develop an adaptive rejection sampler for log-H√∂lder densities, which also has data-independent runtime. We give several examples of DP mechanisms that fit the assumptions of our methods and can thus be implemented using our samplers",

This fact implies the convergence of the associated persistence diagrams. The use of this intrinsic distance when computing persistent homology presents advantageous properties such as robustness to the presence of outliers in the input data and less sensitiveness to the particular embedding of the underlying manifold in the ambient space.

General dimensionality reduction techniques can alleviate such difficulty by extracting a few important features, but they are limited due to the lack of interpretability and connectivity to actual decision making associated with each physical variable. Variable selection techniques, as an alternative, can maintain the interpretability, but they often involve a greedy search that is susceptible to failure in capturing important interactions or a metaheuristic search that requires extensive computations. This research proposes a novel method that identifies critical subspaces, reduced-dimensional physical spaces, to achieve dimensionality reduction and variable selection.

More specifically, a deep generative model is used to model high-dimensional data that are assumed to concentrate around some low-dimensional structure. Estimating the distribution supported on this low-dimensional structure, such as a low-dimensional manifold, is challenging due to its singularity with respect to the Lebesgue measure in the ambient space. In the considered model, a usual likelihood approach can fail to estimate the target distribution consistently due to the singularity. We prove that a novel and effective solution exists by perturbing the data with an instance noise, which leads to consistent estimation of the underlying distribution with desirable convergence rates. We also characterize the class of distributions that can be efficiently estimated via deep generative models. This class is sufficiently general to contain various structured distributions such as product distributions, classically smooth distributions and distributions supported on a low-dimensional manifold.

We use a Siamese recurrent neural network architecture to learn rewards in space and time between motion clips while training an RL policy to minimize this distance. Through experimentation, we also find that the inclusion of multi-task data and additional image encoding losses improve the temporal consistency of the learned rewards and, as a result, significantly improve policy learning.

In the penalized Gaussian regression setup, existing approaches provide adjustments for selection events that can be expressed as linear inequalities in the data variables. Such a representation, however, fails to hold for selection with the Group LASSO and substantially obstructs the scope of subsequent post-selective inference. Key questions of inferential interest, e.g., inference for the effects of selected variables on the outcome, remain unanswered. In the present paper, we develop a consistent, post-selective, Bayesian method to address the existing gaps by deriving a likelihood adjustment factor and an approximation thereof that eliminates bias from the selection of groups.

    "title": "Temporal Abstraction in Reinforcement Learning with the Successor Representation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reasoning at multiple levels of temporal abstraction is one of the key attributes of intelligence. In reinforcement learning, this is often modeled through temporally extended courses of actions called options. Options allow agents to make predictions and to operate at different levels of abstraction within an environment. Nevertheless, approaches based on the options framework often start with the assumption that a reasonable set of options is known beforehand. When this is not the case, there are no definitive answers for which options one should consider. In this paper, we argue that the successor representation, which encodes states based on the pattern of state visitation that follows them, can be seen as a natural substrate for the discovery and use of temporal abstractions. To support our claim, we take a big picture view of recent results, showing how the successor representation can be used to discover options that facilitate either temporally-extended exploration or planning. We cast these results as instantiations of a general framework for option discovery in which the agent's representation is used to identify useful options, which are then used to further improve its representation. This results in a virtuous, never-ending, cycle in which both the representation and the options are constantly refined based on each other. Beyond option discovery itself, we also discuss how the successor representation allows us to augment a set of options into a combinatorially large counterpart without additional learning. This is achieved through the combination of previously learned options. Our empirical evaluation focuses on options discovered for temporally-extended exploration and on the use of the successor representation to combine them. Our results shed light on important design decisions involved in the definition of options and demonstrate the synergy of different methods based on the successor representation, such as eigenoptions and the option keyboard",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Standard Monte Carlo computation is widely known to exhibit a canonical square-root convergence speed in terms of sample size. Two recent techniques, one based on control variate and one on importance sampling, both derived from an integration of reproducing kernels and Stein's identity, have been proposed to reduce the error in Monte Carlo computation to supercanonical convergence. This paper presents a more general framework to encompass both techniques that is especially beneficial when the sample generator is biased and noise-corrupted. We show our general estimator, which we call the doubly robust Stein-kernelized estimator, outperforms both existing methods in terms of mean squared error rates across different scenarios. We also demonstrate the superior performance of our method via numerical examples",

Building off the theory of functional linear regression (FLR), we estimate the best-fit Green's function and bias term of the fundamental solution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) which allows us to regularize their smoothness and impose various structural constraints. We derive a general representer theorem for operator RKHSs to approximate the original infinite-dimensional regression problem by a finite-dimensional one, reducing the search space to a parametric class of Green's functions. In order to study the prediction error of our Green's function estimator, we extend prior results on FLR with scalar outputs to the case with functional outputs. Finally, we demonstrate our method on several linear PDEs including the Poisson, Helmholtz, Schr√∂dinger, Fokker-Planck, and heat equation.

Over the last two decades, this problem has received substantial attention in the frequentist literature. Bayesian approaches for handling measurement error have only been explored recently and are surprisingly successful, although there still is a lack of a proper theoretical justification regarding the asymptotic performance of the estimators. By specifying a Gaussian process prior on the regression function and a Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture prior on the unknown distribution of the unobserved covariates, we show that the posterior distribution of the regression function and the unknown covariate density attain optimal rates of contraction adaptively over a range of Holder classes, up to logarithmic terms. We also develop a novel surrogate prior for approximating the Gaussian process prior that leads to efficient computation and preserves the covariance structure, thereby facilitating easy prior elicitation. We demonstrate the empirical performance of our approach and compare it with competitors in a wide range of simulation experiments and a real data example",

    "title": "Dimension-Grouped Mixed Membership Models for Multivariate Categorical Data",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Mixed Membership Models (MMMs) are a popular family of latent structure models for complex multivariate data. Instead of forcing each subject to belong to a single cluster, MMMs incorporate a vector of subject-specific weights characterizing partial membership across clusters. With this flexibility come challenges in uniquely identifying, estimating, and interpreting the parameters. In this article, we propose a new class of Dimension-Grouped MMMs (Gro-M$^3$s) for multivariate categorical data, which improve parsimony and interpretability. In Gro-M$^3$s, observed variables are partitioned into groups such that the latent membership is constant for variables within a group but can differ across groups. Traditional latent class models are obtained when all variables are in one group, while traditional MMMs are obtained when each variable is in its own group. The new model corresponds to a novel decomposition of probability tensors. Theoretically, we derive transparent identifiability conditions for both the unknown grouping structure and model parameters in general settings. Methodologically, we propose a Bayesian approach for Dirichlet Gro-M$^3$s to inferring the variable grouping structure and estimating model parameters. Simulation results demonstrate good computational performance and empirically confirm the identifiability results.

We formulate the neural operator as a composition of linear integral operators and nonlinear activation functions. We prove a universal approximation theorem for our proposed neural operator, showing that it can approximate any given nonlinear continuous operator. The proposed neural operators are also discretization-invariant, i.e., they share the same model parameters among different discretization of the underlying function spaces. Furthermore, we introduce four classes of efficient parameterization, viz., graph neural operators, multi-pole graph neural operators, low-rank neural operators, and Fourier neural operators. An important application for neural operators is learning surrogate maps for the solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider standard PDEs such as the Burgers, Darcy subsurface flow, and the Navier-Stokes equations, and show that the proposed neural operators have superior performance compared to existing machine learning based methodologies, while being several orders of magnitude faster than conventional PDE solvers",

    "abstract": "In recent years, persistent homology has been successfully applied to real-world data in many different settings. Despite significant computational advances, persistent homology algorithms do not yet scale to large datasets preventing interesting applications. One approach to address computational issues posed by persistent homology is to select a set of landmarks by subsampling from the data. Currently, these landmark points are chosen either at random or using the maxmin algorithm. Neither is ideal as random selection tends to favour dense areas of the data while the maxmin algorithm is very sensitive to noise. Here, we propose a novel approach to select landmarks specifically for persistent homology that preserves coarse topological information of the original dataset. Our method is motivated by the Mayer-Vietoris sequence and requires only local persistent homology calculations thus enabling efficient computation. We test our landmarks on artificial data sets which contain different levels of noise and compare them to standard landmark selection techniques. We demonstrate that our landmark selection outperforms standard methods as well as a subsampling technique based on an outlier-robust version of the k-means algorithm for low sampling densities in noisy data with respect to robustness to outliers",

We prove by construction this lower bound is tight and achievable. Motivated by our insights, we further propose DeTAG, a practical gossip-style decentralized algorithm that achieves the lower bound with only a logarithm gap. While a simple version of DeTAG with plain SGD and constant step size suffice for achieving theoretical limits, we additionally provide convergence bound for DeTAG under general non-increasing step size and momentum. Empirically, we compare DeTAG with other decentralized algorithms on multiple vision benchmarks, including CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet.

    "title": "Faith-Shap: The Faithful Shapley Interaction Index",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Shapley values, which were originally designed to assign attributions to individual players in coalition games, have become a commonly used approach in explainable machine learning to provide attributions to input features for black-box machine learning models. A key attraction of Shapley values is that they uniquely satisfy a very natural set of axiomatic properties. However, extending the Shapley value to assigning attributions to interactions rather than individual players, an interaction index, is non-trivial: as the natural set of axioms for the original Shapley values, extended to the context of interactions, no longer specify a unique interaction index. Many proposals thus introduce additional possibly stringent axioms, while sacrificing the key axiom of efficiency, in order to obtain unique interaction indices. In this work, rather than introduce additional conflicting axioms, we adopt the viewpoint of Shapley values as coefficients of the most faithful linear approximation to the pseudo-Boolean coalition game value function. By extending linear to higher order polynomial approximations, we can then define the general family of faithful interaction indices. We show that by additionally requiring the faithful interaction indices to satisfy interaction-extensions of the standard individual Shapley axioms (dummy, symmetry, linearity, and efficiency), we obtain a unique Faithful Shapley Interaction index, which we denote Faith-Shap, as a natural generalization of the Shapley value to interactions. We then provide some illustrative contrasts of Faith-Shap with previously proposed interaction indices, and further investigate some of its interesting algebraic properties. We further show the computational efficiency of computing Faith-Shap, together with some additional qualitative insights, via some illustrative experiments",

Under a popular nonlinear factor analysis model, we obtain a point estimator and derive its asymptotic normality. Moreover, our analysis adopts a flexible missing-entry design that does not require a random sampling scheme as required by most of the existing asymptotic results for matrix completion. Under reasonable conditions, the proposed estimator is statistically efficient and optimal in the sense that the Cramer-Rao lower bound is achieved asymptotically for the model parameters. Two applications are considered, including (1) linking two forms of an educational test and (2) linking the roll call voting records from multiple years in the United States Senate.

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the performance of sub-gradient method (SubGM) on a natural nonconvex and nonsmooth formulation of low-rank matrix recovery with $\\ell_1$-loss, where the goal is to recover a low-rank matrix from a limited number of measurements, a subset of which may be grossly corrupted with noise. We study a scenario where the rank of the true solution is unknown and over-estimated instead. The over-estimation of the rank gives rise to an over-parameterized model in which there are more degrees of freedom than needed. Such over-parameterization may lead to overfitting, or adversely affect the performance of the algorithm. We prove that a simple SubGM with small initialization is agnostic to both over-parameterization and noise in the measurements. In particular, we show that small initialization nullifies the effect of over-parameterization on the performance of SubGM, leading to an exponential improvement in its convergence rate. Moreover, we provide the first unifying framework for analyzing the behavior of SubGM under both outlier and Gaussian noise models, showing that SubGM converges to the true solution, even under arbitrarily large and arbitrarily dense noise values, and, perhaps surprisingly, even if the globally optimal solutions do not correspond to the ground truth. At the core of our results is a robust variant of restricted isometry property, called Sign-RIP, which controls the deviation of the sub-differential of the $\\ell_1$-loss from that of an ideal, expected loss. As a byproduct of our results, we consider a subclass of robust low-rank matrix recovery with Gaussian measurements, and show that the number of required samples to guarantee the global convergence of SubGM is independent of the over-parameterized rank",

MLE is intractable for graph autoregressive models because the nodes in a graph can be arbitrarily reordered; thus the exact likelihood involves a sum over all possible node orders leading to the same graph. In this work, we fit the graph models by maximizing a variational bound, which is built by first deriving the joint probability over the graph and the node order of the autoregressive process. This approach avoids the need to specify ad-hoc node orders, since an inference network learns the most likely node sequences that have generated a given graph. We improve the approach by developing a graph generative model based on attention mechanisms and an inference network based on routing search. We demonstrate empirically that fitting autoregressive graph models via variational inference improves their qualitative and quantitative performance, and the improved model and inference network further boost the performance",

One fundamental challenge is that small input perturbations can often produce large movements in the network's final-layer feature space.

In our model, the adversary may move data an arbitrary distance in feature space but only in random low-dimensional subspaces. We prove such adversaries can be quite powerful: defeating any algorithm that must classify any input it is given. However, by allowing the algorithm to abstain on unusual inputs, we show such adversaries can be overcome when classes are reasonably well-separated in feature space. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for setting algorithm parameters to optimize over accuracy-abstention trade-offs using data-driven methods. Our results provide new robustness guarantees for nearest-neighbor style algorithms, and also have application to contrastive learning, where we empirically demonstrate the ability of such algorithms to obtain high robust accuracy with low abstention rates.

    "title": "Connectivity Matters: Neural Network Pruning Through the Lens of Effective Sparsity",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural network pruning is a fruitful area of research with surging interest in high sparsity regimes. Benchmarking in this domain heavily relies on faithful representation of the sparsity of subnetworks, which has been traditionally computed as the fraction of removed connections (direct sparsity). This definition, however, fails to recognize unpruned parameters that detached from input or output layers of the underlying subnetworks, potentially underestimating actual effective sparsity: the fraction of inactivated connections. While this effect might be negligible for moderately pruned networks (up to 10‚Äì100 compression rates), we find that it plays an increasing role for sparser subnetworks, greatly distorting comparison between different pruning algorithms. For example, we show that effective compression of a randomly pruned LeNet-300-100 can be orders of magnitude larger than its direct counterpart, while no discrepancy is ever observed when using SynFlow for pruning (Tanaka et al., 2020). In this work, we adopt the lens of effective sparsity to reevaluate several recent pruning algorithms on common benchmark architectures (e.g., LeNet-300-100, VGG-19, ResNet-18) and discover that their absolute and relative performance changes dramatically in this new, and as we argue, more appropriate framework. To aim for effective, rather than direct, sparsity, we develop a low-cost extension to most pruning algorithms. Further, equipped with effective sparsity as a reference frame, we partially reconfirm that random pruning with appropriate sparsity allocation across layers performs as well or better than more sophisticated algorithms for pruning at initialization (Su et al., 2020). In response to this observation, using an analogy of pressure distribution in coupled cylinders from thermodynamics, we design novel layerwise sparsity quotas that outperform all existing baselines in the context of random pruning",

While numerical approximations through graph representations have been well studied for the Matern covariogram and heat kernel, the behaviour of asymptotic inference on the parameters of the covariogram has received relatively scant attention. We focus on asymptotic behaviour for Gaussian processes constructed over compact Riemannian manifolds. Building upon a recently introduced Matern covariogram on a compact Riemannian manifold, we employ formal notions and conditions for the equivalence of two Matern Gaussian random measures on compact manifolds to derive the parameter that is identifiable, also known as the microergodic parameter, and formally establish the consistency of the maximum likelihood estimate and the asymptotic optimality of the best linear unbiased predictor.

In this article, we propose GRoup Outcome Weighted Learning (GROWL) to estimate the latent structure in the treatment space and the optimal group-structured ITRs through a single optimization.

In many real world applications, one often encounters high dimensional data (e.g.‚Äòpoint cloud data') centered around some lower dimensional unknown manifolds. The geometry of manifold is in general different from the usual Euclidean geometry. Naively applying traditional smoothing methods such as Euclidean Gaussian Processes (GPs) to manifold-valued data and so ignoring the geometry of the space can potentially lead to highly misleading predictions and inferences. A manifold embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space can be well described by a probabilistic mapping function and the corresponding latent space. We investigate the geometrical structure of the unknown manifolds using the Bayesian Gaussian Processes latent variable models(B-GPLVM) and Riemannian geometry. The distribution of the metric tensor is learned using B-GPLVM. The boundary of the resulting manifold is defined based on the uncertainty quantification of the mapping. We use the probabilistic metric tensor to simulate Brownian Motion paths on the unknown manifold. The heat kernel is estimated as the transition density of Brownian Motion and used as the covariance functions of GPUM. The applications of GPUM are illustrated in the simulation studies on the Swiss roll, high dimensional real datasets of WiFi signals and image data examples.

    "title": "Knowledge Hypergraph Embedding Meets Relational Algebra",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Relational databases are a successful model for data storage, and rely on query languages for information retrieval. Most of these query languages are based on relational algebra, a mathematical formalization at the core of relational models. Knowledge graphs are flexible data storage structures that allow for knowledge completion using machine learning techniques. Knowledge hypergraphs generalize knowledge graphs by allowing multi-argument relations. This work studies knowledge hypergraph completion through the lens of relational algebra and its core operations. We explore the space between relational algebra foundations and machine learning techniques for knowledge completion. We investigate whether such methods can capture high-level abstractions in terms of relational algebra operations. We propose a simple embedding-based model called Relational Algebra Embedding (ReAlE) that performs link prediction in knowledge hypergraphs. We show theoretically that ReAlE is fully expressive and can represent the relational algebra operations of renaming, projection, set union, selection, and set difference. We verify experimentally that ReAlE outperforms state-of-the-art models in knowledge hypergraph completion, and in representing each of these primitive relational algebra operations. For the latter experiment, we generate a synthetic knowledge hypergraph, for which we design an algorithm based on the Erdos-R'enyi model for generating random graphs",

    "abstract": "We prove concentration inequalities and associated PAC bounds for both continuous- and discrete-time additive functionals for possibly unbounded functions of multivariate, nonreversible diffusion processes. Our analysis relies on an approach via the Poisson equation allowing us to consider a very broad class of subexponentially ergodic, multivariate diffusion processes. These results add to existing concentration inequalities for additive functionals of diffusion processes which have so far been only available for either bounded functions or for unbounded functions of processes from a significantly smaller class. We demonstrate the power of these exponential inequalities by two examples of very different areas. Considering a possibly high-dimensional, parametric, nonlinear drift model under sparsity constraints we apply the continuous-time concentration results to validate the restricted eigenvalue condition for Lasso estimation, which is fundamental for the derivation of oracle inequalities. The results for discrete additive functionals are applied for an investigation of the unadjusted Langevin MCMC algorithm for sampling of moderately heavy tailed densities $\\pi$. In particular, we provide PAC bounds for the sample Monte Carlo estimator of integrals $\\pi(f)$ for polynomially growing functions $f$ that quantify sufficient sample and step sizes for approximation within a prescribed margin with high probability",

We construct physics-informed priors, which are multi-output GP priors that encode the model's structure in the covariance function. This is extended into a fully Bayesian framework that quantifies the uncertainty of physical parameters and model predictions. Since physical models often are imperfect descriptions of the real process, we allow the model to deviate from the observed data by considering a discrepancy function. For inference Hamiltonian Monte Carlo is used. Further, approximations for big data are developed that reduce the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N\\cdot m^2),$ where $m \\ll N.$ Our approach is demonstrated in simulation and real data case studies where the physics are described by time-dependent ODEs (cardiovascular models) and space-time dependent PDEs (heat equation). In the studies, it is shown that our modelling framework can recover the true parameters of the physical models in cases where 1) the reality is more complex than our modelling choice and 2) the data acquisition process is biased while also producing accurate predictions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that our approach is computationally faster than traditional Bayesian calibration methods",

Our theoretical framework extends the standard FedAvg aggregation scheme by introducing stochastic aggregation weights to represent the variability of the clients update time, due for example to heterogeneous hardware capabilities. Our formalism applies to the general federated setting where clients have heterogeneous datasets and perform at least one step of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We demonstrate convergence for such a scheme and provide sufficient conditions for the related minimum to be the optimum of the federated problem. We show that our general framework applies to existing optimization schemes including centralized learning, FedAvg, asynchronous FedAvg, and FedBuff. The theory here provided allows drawing meaningful guidelines for designing a federated learning experiment in heterogeneous conditions. In particular, we develop in this work FedFix, a novel extension of FedAvg enabling efficient asynchronous federated training while preserving the convergence stability of synchronous aggregation. We empirically demonstrate our theory on a series of experiments showing that asynchronous FedAvg leads to fast convergence at the expense of stability, and we finally demonstrate the improvements of FedFix over synchronous and asynchronous FedAvg",

Particularly notable is the idea of noise addition with the guarantee of differential privacy. There are, however, concerns about compromising data utility when very stringent privacy mechanisms are applied. Such compromises can be quite stark in correlated data, such as time series data. Adding white noise to a stochastic process may significantly change the correlation structure, a facet of the process that is essential to optimal prediction. We propose the use of all-pass filtering as a privacy mechanism for regularly sampled time series data, showing that this procedure preserves certain types of utility while also providing sufficient privacy guarantees to entity-level time series. Numerical studies explore the practical performance of the new method, and an empirical application to labor force data show the method's favorable utility properties in comparison to other competing privacy mechanisms",

In that sense, modularity-based community detection methods can be seen as a subclass of a more general class of projection methods, which we define as the community detection methods that adhere to the following two-step procedure: first, mapping the network to a point on the hypersphere; second, projecting this point to the set of clustering vectors. We show that this class of projection methods contains many interesting community detection methods. Many of these new methods cannot be described in terms of null models and resolution parameters, as is customary for modularity-based methods. We provide a new characterization of such methods in terms of meridians and latitudes of the hypersphere.

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a predictor perfectly fits noisy training data while attaining near-optimal expected loss, has received much attention in recent years, but still remains not fully understood beyond well-specified linear regression setups. In this paper, we provide several new results on when one can or cannot expect benign overfitting to occur, for both regression and classification tasks. We consider a prototypical and rather generic data model for benign overfitting of linear predictors, where an arbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension $k$ is concatenated with a high-dimensional distribution. For linear regression which is not necessarily well-specified, we show that the minimum-norm interpolating predictor (that standard training methods converge to) is biased towards an inconsistent solution in general, hence benign overfitting will generally *not* occur. Moreover, we show how this can be extended beyond standard linear regression, by an argument proving how the existence of benign overfitting on some regression problems precludes its existence on other regression problems. We then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much more favorable. Specifically, we prove that the max-margin predictor (to which standard training methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically biased towards minimizing a weighted squared hinge loss. This allows us to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler question of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification error, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings",

Given a large graph, graph coarsening aims to learn a smaller-tractable graph while preserving the properties of the originally given graph.

The existing graph coarsening methods ignore the node features and rely solely on a graph matrix to simplify graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for graph dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework lies in the unification of graph learning and dimensionality reduction. It takes both the graph matrix and the node features as the input and learns the coarsen graph matrix and the coarsen feature matrix jointly while ensuring desired properties. The proposed optimization formulation is a multi-block non-convex optimization problem, which is solved efficiently by leveraging block majorization-minimization, $\\log$ determinant, Dirichlet energy, and regularization frameworks.

This article identifies scenarios where the maximum likelihood estimator fails to be well-posed, in that the predictive distributions are not Lipschitz in the data with respect to the Hellinger distance. These failure cases occur in the noiseless data setting, for any Gaussian process with a stationary covariance function whose lengthscale parameter is estimated using maximum likelihood. Although the failure of maximum likelihood estimation is part of Gaussian process folklore, these rigorous theoretical results appear to be the first of their kind.

One of the central phenomena in this regime is the ability of the model to interpolate noisy data, but still have test error lower than the amount of noise in that data. arXiv:1906.11300 characterized for which covariance structure of the data such a phenomenon can happen in linear regression if one considers the interpolating solution with minimum $\\ell_2$-norm and the data has independent components: they gave a sharp bound on the variance term and showed that it can be small if and only if the data covariance has high effective rank in a subspace of small co-dimension. We strengthen and complete their results by eliminating the independence assumption and providing sharp bounds for the bias term. Thus, our results apply in a much more general setting than those of arXiv:1906.11300, e.g., kernel regression, and not only characterize how the noise is damped but also which part of the true signal is learned.

Taking a fully inferential viewpoint, this paper introduces a novel procedure termed HiGrad to conduct statistical inference for online learning, without incurring additional computational cost compared with SGD. The HiGrad procedure begins by performing SGD updates for a while and then splits the single thread into several threads, and this procedure hierarchically operates in this fashion along each thread. With predictions provided by multiple threads in place, a $t$-based confidence interval is constructed by decorrelating predictions using covariance structures given by a Donsker-style extension of the Ruppert--Polyak averaging scheme, which is a technical contribution of independent interest. Under certain regularity conditions, the HiGrad confidence interval is shown to attain asymptotically exact coverage probability. Finally, the performance of HiGrad is evaluated through extensive simulation studies and a real data example. An R package \\texttt{higrad} has been developed to implement the method",

Consequently the existing convergence results may not provide a guarantee as to whether the empirical risks are reliable or not when the data are potentially corrupted (generated by a distribution perturbed from the true). In this paper, we fill out the gap from robust statistics perspective (Kr√§tschmer, Schied and Z√§hle (2012); Kr√§tschmer, Schied and Z√§hle (2014); Guo and Xu (2020). First, we derive moderate sufficient conditions under which the expected risk changes stably (continuously) against small perturbation of the probability distributions of the underlying random variables and demonstrate how the cost function and kernel affect the stability. Second, we examine the difference between laws of the statistical estimators of the expected optimal loss based on pure data and contaminated data using Prokhorov metric and Kantorovich metric, and derive some asymptotic qualitative and non-asymptotic quantitative statistical robustness results. Third, we identify appropriate metrics under which the statistical estimators are uniformly asymptotically consistent. These results provide theoretical grounding for analysing asymptotic convergence and examining reliability of the statistical estimators in a number of regression models",

    "abstract": "We consider Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and address the underlying functional optimization problem ab initio within a variational setting. Strictly speaking, the optimization of the generator and discriminator functions must be carried out in accordance with the Euler-Lagrange conditions, which become particularly relevant in scenarios where the optimization cost involves regularizers comprising the derivatives of these functions. Considering Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) with a gradient-norm penalty, we show that the optimal discriminator is the solution to a Poisson differential equation. In principle, the optimal discriminator can be obtained in closed form without having to train a neural network. We illustrate this by employing a Fourier-series approximation to solve the Poisson differential equation. Experimental results based on synthesized Gaussian data demonstrate superior convergence behavior of the proposed approach in comparison with the baseline WGAN variants that employ weight-clipping, gradient or Lipschitz penalties on the discriminator on low-dimensional data. We also analyze the truncation error of the Fourier-series approximation and the estimation error of the Fourier coefficients in a high-dimensional setting. We demonstrate applications to real-world images considering latent-space prior matching in Wasserstein autoencoders and present performance comparisons on benchmark datasets such as MNIST, SVHN, CelebA, CIFAR-10, and Ukiyo-E. We demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves comparable reconstruction error and Frechet inception distance with faster convergence and up to two-fold improvement in image sharpness",

Graph clustering has the same overall goal as node pooling in GNNs‚Äîdoes this mean that GNN pooling methods do a good job at clustering graphs? Surprisingly, the answer is no‚Äîcurrent GNN pooling methods often fail to recover the cluster structure in cases where simple baselines, such as k-means applied on learned representations, work well. We investigate further by carefully designing a set of experiments to study different signal-to-noise scenarios both in graph structure and attribute data. To address these methods' poor performance in clustering, we introduce Deep Modularity Networks (DMoN), an unsupervised pooling method inspired by the modularity measure of clustering quality, and show how it tackles recovery of the challenging clustering structure of real-world graphs. Similarly, on real-world data, we show that DMoN produces high quality clusters which correlate strongly with ground truth labels, achieving state-of-the-art results with over 40% improvement over other pooling methods across different metrics",

In response, alternatives to centralized training such as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. FL is now starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies that must adhere to new legal demands and policies originating from governments and social groups advocating for privacy protection. However, the potential environmental impact related to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This article offers the first-ever systematic study of the carbon footprint of FL. We propose a rigorous model to quantify the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the investigation of the relationship between FL design and carbon emissions. We also compare the carbon footprint of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our findings show that, depending on the configuration, FL can emit up to two orders of magnitude more carbon than centralized training. However, in certain settings, it can be comparable to centralized learning due to the reduced energy consumption of embedded devices. Finally, we highlight and connect the results to the future challenges and trends in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware capabilities, and stronger industry transparency",

Information theory provides a powerful framework for formulating feature selection algorithms‚Äîyet, a rigorous, information-theoretic definition of feature relevancy, which accounts for feature interactions such as redundant and synergistic contributions, is still missing. We argue that this lack is inherent to classical information theory which does not provide measures to decompose the information a set of variables provides about a target into unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions. Such a decomposition has been introduced only recently by the partial information decomposition (PID) framework. Using PID, we clarify why feature selection is a conceptually difficult problem when approached using information theory and provide a novel definition of feature relevancy and redundancy in PID terms. From this definition, we show that the conditional mutual information (CMI) maximizes relevancy while minimizing redundancy and propose an iterative, CMI-based algorithm for practical feature selection. We demonstrate the power of our CMI-based algorithm in comparison to the unconditional mutual information on benchmark examples and provide corresponding PID estimates to highlight how PID allows to quantify information contribution of features and their interactions in feature-selection problems",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of estimating smooth Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) in the Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (NLDP) model. Unlike its classical setting, our model allows the server to access additional public but unlabeled data. In the first part of the paper, we focus on GLMs. Specifically, we first consider the case where each data record is i.i.d. sampled from a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the Stein's lemma, we present an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-NLDP algorithm for GLMs. Moreover, the sample complexity of public and private data for the algorithm to achieve an $\\ell_2$-norm estimation error of $\\alpha$ (with high probability) is ${O}(p \\alpha^{-2})$ and $\\tilde{O}(p^3\\alpha^{-2}\\epsilon^{-2})$ respectively, where $p$ is the dimension of the feature vector. This is a significant improvement over the previously known exponential or quasi-polynomial in $\\alpha^{-1}$, or exponential in $p$ sample complexities of GLMs with no public data. Then we consider a more general setting where each data record is i.i.d. sampled from some sub-Gaussian distribution with bounded $\\ell_1$-norm. Based on a variant of Stein's lemma, we propose an $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-NLDP algorithm for GLMs whose sample complexity of public and private data to achieve an $\\ell_\\infty$-norm estimation error of $\\alpha$ is ${O}(p^2\\alpha^{-2})$ and $\\tilde{O}(p^2\\alpha^{-2}\\epsilon^{-2})$ respectively, under some mild assumptions and if $\\alpha$ is not too small i.e., $\\alpha\\geq \\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{p}})$). In the second part of the paper, we extend our idea to the problem of estimating non-linear regressions and show similar results as in GLMs for both multivariate Gaussian and sub-Gaussian cases. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

However, standard approaches to RD analysis face two significant limitations. First, they require a priori knowledge of discontinuities in treatment. Second, they yield doubly-local treatment effect estimates, and fail to provide more general causal effect estimates away from the discontinuity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel method for automatically detecting RDs at scale, integrating information from multiple discovered discontinuities with an observational estimator, and extrapolating away from discovered, local RDs. We demonstrate the performance of our method on two synthetic datasets, showing improved performance compared to direct use of an observational estimator, direct extrapolation of RD estimates, and existing methods for combining multiple causal effect estimates.

    "abstract": "Estimation of the precision matrix (or inverse covariance matrix) is of great importance in statistical data analysis and machine learning. However, as the number of parameters scales quadratically with the dimension $p$, the computation becomes very challenging when $p$ is large. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sieving reduction algorithm to generate a solution path for the estimation of precision matrices under the $\\ell_1$ penalized D-trace loss, with each subproblem being solved by a second-order algorithm. In each iteration of our algorithm, we are able to greatly reduce the number of variables in the problem based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the sparse structure of the estimated precision matrix in the previous iteration. As a result, our algorithm is capable of handling data sets with very high dimensions that may go beyond the capacity of the existing methods. Moreover, for the sub-problem in each iteration, other than solving the primal problem directly, we develop a semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian algorithm with global linear convergence rate on the dual problem to improve the efficiency. Theoretical properties of our proposed algorithm have been established. In particular, we show that the convergence rate of our algorithm is asymptotically superlinear.

The reward function to learn, $f(x,y)$, does not have a particular parametric form. The literature has shown that the optimal regret is $\\tilde{O}(T^{(d_x\\!+\\!d_y\\!+\\!1)/(d_x\\!+\\!d_y\\!+\\!2)})$, where $d_x$ and $d_y$ are the dimensions of $x$ and $y$, and thus it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In many applications, only a small subset of variables in the covariate affect the value of $f$, which is referred to as sparsity in statistics. To take advantage of the sparsity structure of the covariate, we propose a variable selection algorithm called BV-LASSO, which incorporates novel ideas such as binning and voting to apply LASSO to nonparametric settings. Using it as a subroutine, we can achieve the regret $\\tilde{O}(T^{(d_x^*\\!+\\!d_y\\!+\\!1)/(d_x^*\\!+\\!d_y\\!+\\!2)})$, where $d_x^*$ is the effective covariate dimension.

We compute the curvature penalty function explicitly for various common initialization procedures. For instance, asymmetric initialization with a uniform distribution yields a constant curvature penalty, and thence the solution function is the natural cubic spline interpolation of the training data. For stochastic gradient descent we obtain the same implicit bias result. We obtain a similar result for different activation functions. For multivariate regression we show an analogous result, whereby the second derivative is replaced by the Radon transform of a fractional Laplacian. For initialization schemes that yield a constant penalty function, the solutions are polyharmonic splines.

Our work encapsulates representation methods using a subsampling approach, such as node2vec, into a single unifying framework. We prove, under the assumption that the graph is exchangeable, that the distribution of the learned embedding vectors asymptotically decouples. Moreover, we characterize the asymptotic distribution and provided rates of convergence, in terms of the latent parameters, which includes the choice of loss function and the embedding dimension.

Most of the existing works in the literature consider settings with binary or finitely many treatment options. In this paper, we focus on the continuous treatment setting and propose a jump interval-learning to develop an individualized interval-valued decision rule (I2DR) that maximizes the expected outcome. Unlike IDRs that recommend a single treatment, the proposed I2DR yields an interval of treatment options for each individual, making it more flexible to implement in practice. To derive an optimal I2DR, our jump interval-learning method estimates the conditional mean of the outcome given the treatment and the covariates via jump penalized regression, and derives the corresponding optimal I2DR based on the estimated outcome regression function. The regressor is allowed to be either linear for clear interpretation or deep neural network to model complex treatment-covariates interactions. To implement jump interval-learning, we develop a searching algorithm based on dynamic programming that efficiently computes the outcome regression function. Statistical properties of the resulting I2DR are established when the outcome regression function is either a piecewise or continuous function over the treatment space. We further develop a procedure to infer the mean outcome under the (estimated) optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real data application to a Warfarin study are conducted to demonstrate the empirical validity of the proposed I2DR",

Despite its prevalence in related fields, tilting has not seen widespread use in machine learning. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by exploring the use of tilting in risk minimization. We study a simple extension to ERM---tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM)---which uses exponential tilting to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses. The resulting framework has several useful properties: We show that TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variance-reduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to the tail probability of losses. Our work makes connections between TERM and related objectives, such as Value-at-Risk, Conditional Value-at-Risk, and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). We develop batch and stochastic first-order optimization methods for solving TERM, provide convergence guarantees for the solvers, and show that the framework can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications in machine learning, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. Despite the straightforward modification TERM makes to traditional ERM objectives, we find that the framework can consistently outperform ERM and deliver competitive performance with state-of-the-art, problem-specific approaches",

    "abstract": "Bayesian mixture models are widely used for clustering of high-dimensional data with appropriate uncertainty quantification. However, as the dimension of the observations increases, posterior inference often tends to favor too many or too few clusters. This article explains this behavior by studying the random partition posterior in a non-standard setting with a fixed sample size and increasing data dimensionality. We provide conditions under which the finite sample posterior tends to either assign every observation to a different cluster or all observations to the same cluster as the dimension grows. Interestingly, the conditions do not depend on the choice of clustering prior, as long as all possible partitions of observations into clusters have positive prior probabilities, and hold irrespective of the true data-generating model. We then propose a class of latent mixtures for Bayesian clustering (Lamb) on a set of low-dimensional latent variables inducing a partition on the observed data. The model is amenable to scalable posterior inference and we show that it can avoid the pitfalls of high-dimensionality under mild assumptions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has become a popular research area. However, the stochastic optimization of MAML is still underdeveloped. Existing MAML algorithms rely on the \"episode\" idea by sampling a few tasks and data points to update the meta-model at each iteration. Nonetheless, these algorithms either fail to guarantee convergence with a constant mini-batch size or require processing a large number of tasks at every iteration, which is unsuitable for continual learning or cross-device federated learning where only a small number of tasks are available per iteration or per round. To address these issues, this paper proposes memory-based stochastic algorithms for MAML that converge with vanishing error. The proposed algorithms require sampling a constant number of tasks and data samples per iteration, making them suitable for the continual learning scenario. Moreover, we introduce a communication-efficient memory-based MAML algorithm for personalized federated learning in cross-device (with client sampling) and cross-silo (without client sampling) settings. Our theoretical analysis improves the optimization theory for MAML, and our empirical results corroborate our theoretical findings",

    "abstract": "A variety of theoretically-sound policy gradient algorithms exist for the on-policy setting due to the policy gradient theorem, which provides a simplified form for the gradient. The off-policy setting, however, has been less clear due to the existence of multiple objectives and the lack of an explicit off-policy policy gradient theorem. In this work, we unify these objectives into one off-policy objective, and provide a policy gradient theorem for this unified objective. The derivation involves emphatic weightings and interest functions. We show multiple strategies to approximate the gradients, in an algorithm called Actor Critic with Emphatic weightings (ACE). We prove in a counterexample that previous (semi-gradient) off-policy actor-critic methods‚Äîparticularly Off-Policy Actor-Critic (OffPAC) and Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG)‚Äîconverge to the wrong solution whereas ACE finds the optimal solution. We also highlight why these semi-gradient approaches can still perform well in practice, suggesting strategies for variance reduction in ACE. We empirically study several variants of ACE on two classic control environments and an image-based environment designed to illustrate the tradeoffs made by each gradient approximation. We find that by approximating the emphatic weightings directly, ACE performs as well as or better than OffPAC in all settings tested",

We consider leveraging the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition to design faster stochastic algorithms with stronger convergence guarantee. Although PL condition has been utilized for designing many stochastic minimization algorithms, their applications for non-convex min-max optimization remain rare. In this paper, we propose and analyze a generic framework of proximal stage-based method with many well-known stochastic updates embeddable. Fast convergence is established in terms of both the primal objective gap and the duality gap. Compared with existing studies, (i) our analysis is based on a novel Lyapunov function consisting of the primal objective gap and the duality gap of a regularized function, and (ii) the results are more comprehensive with improved rates that have better dependence on the condition number under different assumptions.

Maximum Mean Discrepancies (MMD) and Wasserstein distances are two classes of distances between probability distributions that have attracted abundant attention in past years. This paper establishes some conditions under which the Wasserstein distance can be controlled by MMD norms. Our work is motivated by the compressive statistical learning (CSL) theory, a general framework for resource-efficient large scale learning in which the training data is summarized in a single vector (called sketch) that captures the information relevant to the considered learning task. Inspired by existing results in CSL, we introduce the H√∂lder Lower Restricted Isometric Property and show that this property comes with interesting guarantees for compressive statistical learning. Based on the relations between the MMD and the Wasserstein distances, we provide guarantees for compressive statistical learning by introducing and studying the concept of Wasserstein regularity of the learning task, that is when some task-specific metric between probability distributions can be bounded by a Wasserstein distance",

    "title": "Consistent Model-based Clustering using the Quasi-Bernoulli Stick-breaking Process",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In mixture modeling and clustering applications, the number of components and clusters is often not known. A stick-breaking mixture model, such as the Dirichlet process mixture model, is an appealing construction that assumes infinitely many components, while shrinking the weights of most of the unused components to near zero. However, it is well-known that this shrinkage is inadequate: even when the component distribution is correctly specified, spurious weights appear and give an inconsistent estimate of the number of clusters. In this article, we propose a simple solution: when breaking each mixture weight stick into two pieces, the length of the second piece is multiplied by a quasi-Bernoulli random variable, taking value one or a small constant close to zero. This effectively creates a soft truncation and further shrinks the unused weights. Asymptotically, we show that as long as this small constant diminishes to zero at a rate faster than $o(1/n^2)$, with $n$ the sample size and given data from a finite mixture model, the posterior distribution will converge to the true number of clusters. In comparison, we rigorously explore Dirichlet process mixture models using a concentration parameter that is either constant or rapidly diminishes to zero---both of which lead to inconsistency for the number of clusters. Our proposed model is easy to implement, requiring only a small modification of a standard Gibbs sampler for mixture models. In simulations and a data application of clustering brain networks, our proposed method recovers the ground-truth number of clusters, and leads to a small number of clusters",

However, most influence-estimation techniques are designed for deep learning models with continuous parameters. Gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are a powerful and widely-used class of models; however, these models are black boxes with opaque decision-making processes. In the pursuit of better understanding GBDT predictions and generally improving these models, we adapt recent and popular influence-estimation methods designed for deep learning models to GBDTs. Specifically, we adapt representer-point methods and TracIn, denoting our new methods TREX and BoostIn, respectively; source code is available at https://github.com/jjbrophy47/treeinfluence. We compare these methods to LeafInfluence and other baselines using 5 different evaluation measures on 22 real-world data sets with 4 popular GBDT implementations. These experiments give us a comprehensive overview of how different approaches to influence estimation work in GBDT models. We find BoostIn is an efficient influence-estimation method for GBDTs that performs equally well or better than existing work while being four orders of magnitude faster. Our evaluation also suggests the gold-standard approach of leave-one-out (LOO) retraining consistently identifies the single-most influential training example but performs poorly at finding the most influential set of training examples for a given target prediction",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data depth, introduced by Tukey (1975), is an important tool in data science, robust statistics, and computational geometry. One chief barrier to its broader practical utility is that many common measures of depth are computationally intensive, requiring on the order of $n^d$ operations to exactly compute the depth of a single point within a data set of $n$ points in $d$-dimensional space. Often however, we are not directly interested in the absolute depths of the points, but rather in their relative ordering. For example, we may want to find the most central point in a data set (a generalized median), or to identify and remove all outliers (points on the fringe of the data set with low depth). With this observation, we develop a novel instance-adaptive algorithm for adaptive data depth computation by reducing the problem of exactly computing $n$ depths to an $n$-armed stochastic multi-armed bandit problem which we can efficiently solve. We focus our exposition on simplicial depth, developed by Liu (1990), which has emerged as a promising notion of depth due to its interpretability and asymptotic properties. We provide general data-dependent theoretical guarantees for our proposed algorithms, which readily extend to many other common measures of data depth including majority depth, Oja depth, and likelihood depth. When specialized to the case where the gaps in the data follow a power law distribution with parameter $\\alpha<2$, we reduce the complexity of identifying the deepest point in the data set (the simplicial median) from $O(n^d)$ to $\\tilde{O}(n^{d-(d-1)\\alpha/2})$, where $\\tilde{O}$ suppresses a logarithmic factor. We corroborate our theoretical results with numerical experiments on synthetic data, showing the practical utility of our proposed methods",

    "abstract": "Modern approaches to supervised learning like deep neural networks (DNNs) typically implicitly assume that observed responses are statistically independent. In contrast, correlated data are prevalent in real-life large-scale applications, with typical sources of correlation including spatial, temporal and clustering structures. These correlations are either ignored by DNNs, or ad-hoc solutions are developed for specific use cases. We propose to use the mixed models framework to handle correlated data in DNNs. By treating the effects underlying the correlation structure as random effects, mixed models are able to avoid overfitted parameter estimates and ultimately yield better predictive performance. The key to combining mixed models and DNNs is using the Gaussian negative log-likelihood (NLL) as a natural loss function that is minimized with DNN machinery including stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Since NLL does not decompose like standard DNN loss functions, the use of SGD with NLL presents some theoretical and implementation challenges, which we address. Our approach which we call LMMNN is demonstrated to improve performance over natural competitors in various correlation scenarios on diverse simulated and real datasets.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The framework of optimal transport has been leveraged to extend the notion of rank to the multivariate setting as corresponding to an optimal transport map, while preserving desirable properties of the resulting goodness-of-fit (GoF) statistics. In particular, the rank energy (RE) and rank maximum mean discrepancy (RMMD) are distribution-free under the null, exhibit high power in statistical testing, and are robust to outliers. In this paper, we point to and alleviate some of the shortcomings of these GoF statistics that are of practical significance, namely high computational cost, curse of dimensionality in statistical sample complexity, and lack of differentiability with respect to the data. We show that all these issues are addressed by defining multivariate rank as an entropic transport map derived from the entropic regularization of the optimal transport problem, which we refer to as the soft rank. We consequently propose two new statistics, the soft rank energy (sRE) and soft rank maximum mean discrepancy (sRMMD). Given n sample data points, we provide non-asymptotic convergence rates for the sample estimate of the entropic transport map to its population version that are essentially of the order n^(-1/2) when the source measure is subgaussian and the target measure has compact support. This result is novel compared to existing results which achieve a rate of n^(-1) but crucially rely on both measures having compact support. In contrast, the corresponding convergence rate of estimating an optimal transport map, and hence the rank map, is exponential in the data dimension. We leverage these fast convergence rates to show that the sample estimates of sRE and sRMMD converge rapidly to their population versions. Combined with the computational efficiency of methods in solving the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem, these results enable efficient rank-based GoF statistical computation, even in high dimensions. Furthermore, the sample estimates of sRE and sRMMD are differentiable with respect to the data and amenable to popular machine learning frameworks that rely on gradient methods.

For instance, epidemiological forecasts, cost estimates, and revenue predictions all benefit from being able to quantify the range of possible values accurately. As such, many models have been developed for this problem over many years of research in statistics, machine learning, and related fields. Rather than proposing yet another (new) algorithm for quantile regression we adopt a meta viewpoint: we investigate methods for aggregating any number of conditional quantile models, in order to improve accuracy and robustness. We consider weighted ensembles where weights may vary over not only individual models, but also over quantile levels, and feature values. All of the models we consider in this paper can be fit using modern deep learning toolkits, and hence are widely accessible (from an implementation point of view) and scalable. To improve the accuracy of the predicted quantiles (or equivalently, prediction intervals), we develop tools for ensuring that quantiles remain monotonically ordered, and apply conformal calibration methods. These can be used without any modification of the original library of base models. We also review some basic theory surrounding quantile aggregation and related scoring rules, and contribute a few new results to this literature (for example, the fact that post sorting or post isotonic regression can only improve the weighted interval score).

While only a second-order stationary point $X$ can be provably found in reasonable time, if $X$ is additionally rank deficient, then its rank deficiency certifies it as being globally optimal. This way of certifying global optimality necessarily requires the search rank $r$ of the current iterate $X$ to be overparameterized with respect to the rank $r^{\\star}$ of the global minimizer $X^{\\star}$. Unfortunately, overparameterization significantly slows down the convergence of gradient descent, from a linear rate with $r=r^{\\star}$ to a sublinear rate when $r>r^{\\star}$, even when $\\phi$ is strongly convex.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The acquisition of labels for supervised learning can be expensive. To improve the sample efficiency of neural network regression, we study active learning methods that adaptively select batches of unlabeled data for labeling. We present a framework for constructing such methods out of (network-dependent) base kernels, kernel transformations, and selection methods. Our framework encompasses many existing Bayesian methods based on Gaussian process approximations of neural networks as well as non-Bayesian methods. Additionally, we propose to replace the commonly used last-layer features with sketched finite-width neural tangent kernels and to combine them with a novel clustering method. To evaluate different methods, we introduce an open-source benchmark consisting of 15 large tabular regression data sets. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art on our benchmark, scales to large data sets, and works out-of-the-box without adjusting the network architecture or training code. We provide open-source code that includes efficient implementations of all kernels, kernel transformations, and selection methods, and can be used for reproducing our results",

We employ, in a generic learning setting, two algorithms depending on whether the considered loss function is gradient-Lipschitz or not. Then, we instantiate our framework on several applications including vanilla sparse, group-sparse and low-rank matrix recovery. This leads, for each application, to efficient and robust learning algorithms, that reach near-optimal estimation rates under heavy-tailed distributions and the presence of outliers. For vanilla $s$-sparsity, we are able to reach the $s\\log (d)/n$ rate under heavy-tails and $\\eta$-corruption, at a computational cost comparable to that of non-robust analogs.

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider a composite optimization problem that minimizes the sum of a weakly smooth function and a convex function with either a bounded domain or a uniformly convex structure. In particular, we first present a parameter-dependent conditional gradient method for this problem, whose step sizes require prior knowledge of the parameters associated with the H√∂lder continuity of the gradient of the weakly smooth function, and establish its rate of convergence. Given that these parameters could be unknown or known but possibly conservative, such a method may suffer from implementation issue or slow convergence. We therefore propose a parameter-free conditional gradient method whose step size is determined by using a constructive local quadratic upper approximation and an adaptive line search scheme, without using any problem parameter. We show that this method achieves the same rate of convergence as the parameter-dependent conditional gradient method. Preliminary experiments are also conducted and illustrate the superior performance of the parameter-free conditional gradient method over the methods with some other step size rules",

    "abstract": "We analyse a general class of bilevel problems, in which the upper-level problem consists in the minimization of a smooth objective function and the lower-level problem is to find the fixed point of a smooth contraction map. This type of problems include instances of meta-learning, equilibrium models, hyperparameter optimization and data poisoning adversarial attacks. Several recent works have proposed algorithms which warm-start the lower-level problem, i.e. they use the previous lower-level approximate solution as a staring point for the lower-level solver. This warm-start procedure allows one to improve the sample complexity in both the stochastic and deterministic settings, achieving in some cases the order-wise optimal sample complexity. However, there are situations, e.g., meta learning and equilibrium models, in which the warm-start procedure is not well-suited or ineffective. In this work we show that without warm-start, it is still possible to achieve order-wise (near) optimal sample complexity. In particular, we propose a simple method which uses (stochastic) fixed point iterations at the lower-level and projected inexact gradient descent at the upper-level, that reaches an $\\epsilon$-stationary point using $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ samples for the stochastic and the deterministic setting, respectively. Finally, compared to methods using warm-start, our approach yields a simpler analysis that does not need to study the coupled interactions between the upper-level and lower-level iterates",

The second stage uses statistical models to embed the testing on the tree and control the false discovery rate.

We prove embedding guarantees for feature maps implemented by small neural networks called probabilistic transformers. Our guarantees are of memorization type: we prove that a probabilistic transformer of depth about $n\\log(n)$ and width about $n^2$ can bi-H\\\"older embed any $n$-point dataset from $\\mathcal{X}$ with low metric distortion, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. We further derive probabilistic bi-Lipschitz guarantees, which trade off the amount of distortion and the probability that a randomly chosen pair of points embeds with that distortion. If the geometry of $\\mathcal{X}$ is sufficiently regular, we obtain stronger bi-Lipschitz guarantees for all points. As applications, we derive neural embedding guarantees for datasets from Riemannian manifolds, metric trees, and certain types of combinatorial graphs. When instead embedding into multivariate Gaussian mixtures, we show that probabilistic transformers compute bi-H√∂lder embeddings with arbitrarily small distortion. Our results show that any finite metric dataset, from vertices on a graph to functions a function space, can be faithfully represented in a single representation space, and that the representation can be implemented by a simple transformer architecture. Thus one may only need a modular set of machine learning tools compatible with this one representation space, many of which already exist, for downstream supervised and unsupervised learning from a great variety of data types",

We first establish the equivalence of this algorithm with popular VI methods such as reflected gradient, Popov or optimistic gradient descent-ascent (OGDA) in the unconstrained case with constant step sizes. We then move on to the constrained setting and introduce a new analysis that allows to use larger step sizes, to complete the bridge between the golden ratio algorithm and the existing algorithms in the literature. Doing so, we actually eliminate the link between the golden ratio {$\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$} and the algorithm. Moreover, we improve the adaptive version of the algorithm, first by removing the maximum step size hyperparameter (an artifact from the analysis), and secondly, by adjusting it to nonmonotone problems with weak Minty solutions, with superior empirical performance",

The probabilistic top list functional is elicitable through the use of strictly consistent evaluation metrics.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning (RL), which finds an optimal policy after establishing an empirical model, has long been recognized as one of the cornerstones of RL. It is especially suitable for multi-agent RL (MARL), as it naturally decouples the learning and the planning phases, and avoids the non-stationarity problem when all agents are improving their policies simultaneously. Though intuitive and widely-used, the sample complexity of model-based MARL algorithms has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we aim to ad- dress the fundamental question about its sample complexity. We study arguably the most basic MARL setting: two-player discounted zero-sum Markov games, given only access to a generative model. We show that model-based MARL achieves a sample complexity of Oe(|S||A||B|(1 ‚àí Œ≥)‚àí3Œµ‚àí2) for finding the Nash equilibrium (NE) value up to some Œµ error, and the Œµ-NE policies with a smooth planning oracle, where Œ≥ is the discount factor, and S,A,B denote the state space, and the action spaces for the two agents. We further show that such a sample bound is minimax-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) if the algorithm is reward-agnostic, where the algorithm queries state transition samples without reward knowledge, by establishing a matching lower bound. This is in contrast to the usual reward- aware setting, where the sample complexity lower bound is Œ©e(|S|(|A| + |B|)(1 ‚àí Œ≥)‚àí3Œµ‚àí2), and this model-based approach is near-optimal with only a gap on the |A|, |B| dependence. Our results not only illustrate the sample-efficiency of this basic model-based MARL approach, but also elaborate on the fundamental tradeoff between its power (easily handling the reward-agnostic case) and limitation (less adaptive and suboptimal in |A|, |B|), which particularly arises in the multi-agent context",

    "abstract": "Traditional centralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are sometimes unpractical in complicated applications due to non-interactivity between agents, the curse of dimensionality, and computation complexity. Hence, several decentralized MARL algorithms are motivated. However, existing decentralized methods only handle the fully cooperative setting where massive information needs to be transmitted in training. The block coordinate gradient descent scheme they used for successive independent actor and critic steps can simplify the calculation, but it causes serious bias. This paper proposes a flexible fully decentralized actor-critic MARL framework, which can combine most of the actor-critic methods and handle large-scale general cooperative multi-agent settings. A primal-dual hybrid gradient descent type algorithm framework is designed to learn individual agents separately for decentralization. From the perspective of each agent, policy improvement and value evaluation are jointly optimized, which can stabilize multi-agent policy learning. Furthermore, the proposed framework can achieve scalability and stability for the large-scale environment. This framework also reduces information transmission by the parameter sharing mechanism and novel modeling-other-agents methods based on theory-of-mind and online supervised learning. Sufficient experiments in cooperative Multi-agent Particle Environment and StarCraft II show that the proposed decentralized MARL instantiation algorithms perform competitively against conventional centralized and decentralized methods",

They have resemblance to Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs), but break free from some limitations of PGMs. By aiming to provide expressive methods for representation learning instead of computing marginals or most likely configurations, GNNs provide flexibility in the choice of information flowing rules while maintaining good performance. Despite their success and inspirations, they lack efficient ways to represent and learn higher-order relations among variables/nodes. More expressive higher-order GNNs which operate on k-tuples of nodes need increased computational resources in order to process higher-order tensors. We propose Factor Graph Neural Networks (FGNNs) to effectively capture higher-order relations for inference and learning. To do so, we first derive an efficient approximate Sum-Product loopy belief propagation inference algorithm for discrete higher-order PGMs. We then neuralize the novel message passing scheme into a Factor Graph Neural Network (FGNN) module by allowing richer representations of the message update rules; this facilitates both efficient inference and powerful end-to-end learning. We further show that with a suitable choice of message aggregation operators, our FGNN is also able to represent Max-Product belief propagation, providing a single family of architecture that can represent both Max and Sum-Product loopy belief propagation.

Wang and Blei (2019, WB) generalize these procedures to develop the \"deconfounder,\" a causal inference method using factor models of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ to estimate \"substitute confounders,\" $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Z}}$, then estimating treatment effects---regressing the outcome, $\\boldsymbol{Y}$, on part of $\\boldsymbol{A}$ while adjusting for $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{Z}}$.

We prove that when the conditions hold for the deconfounder to be asymptotically unbiased, a naive semiparametric regression of $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ on $\\boldsymbol{A}$ which ignores confounding is also asymptotically unbiased. We provide bias formulas for finite numbers of treatments and show that different deconfounders exhibit different kinds of bias. We replicate every deconfounder analysis with available data and find that neither the naive regression nor the deconfounder consistently outperform the other. In practice, the deconfounder produces implausible estimates in WB's case study of movie earnings: estimates suggest comic author Stan Lee's cameo appearances causally contributed $15.5 billion, most of Marvel movie revenue.

Several of such variants have been proposed independently and while intuitively similar, their relationship has not yet been made explicit. In an effort to make the emerging picture of generative evaluation more clear, we propose a unification of four curves known respectively as: the Precision-Recall (PR) curve, the Lorenz curve, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and a special case of R√©nyi divergence frontiers.

    "title": "Learning an Explicit Hyper-parameter Prediction Function Conditioned on Tasks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Meta learning has attracted much attention recently in machine learning community. Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent prediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to learn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning methodology. In this study, we achieve such learning methodology by learning an explicit hyper-parameter prediction function shared by all training tasks, and we call this learning process as Simulating Learning Methodology (SLeM). Specifically, this function is represented as a parameterized function called meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyper-parameter setting, extracted from a pre-specified function set called meta learning machine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed hyper-parameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability to query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its generalization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally leads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of the extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its generalization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including few-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization.

Two complementary types of approaches have been developed to address this obstacle: obtaining identification using fortuitous external aids, such as instrumental variables or proxies, or by means of the ID algorithm, using Markov restrictions on the full data distribution encoded in graphical causal models. In this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the former and latter approaches to identification in causal inference to yield the most general identification algorithm in multivariate systems currently known -- the proximal ID algorithm. In addition to being able to obtain nonparametric identification in all cases where the ID algorithm succeeds, our approach allows us to systematically exploit proxies to adjust for the presence of unobserved confounders that would have otherwise prevented identification.

This makes training particularly simple, but (a priori) reduces expressivity. Interestingly, this is not the case for certain Black-Scholes type PDEs, as we show here. We derive bounds for the prediction error of random neural networks for learning sufficiently non-degenerate Black-Scholes type models.

We also investigate an application of these results to basket options and validate the bounds numerically.

This highly flexible approach can solve clustering problems in various setups, ranging from questionnaires over community detection in graphs to clustering points in metric spaces. The output of our proposed framework is hierarchical and induces the notion of a soft dendrogram, which can help explore the cluster structure of a dataset. The computational complexity of aggregating the cuts is linear in the number of data points. Thus the bottleneck of the tangle approach is to generate the cuts, for which simple and fast algorithms form a sufficient basis. In our paper we construct the algorithmic framework for clustering with tangles, prove theoretical guarantees in various settings, and provide extensive simulations and use cases.

However, there does not exist a fair and thorough assessment of these embedding methods and therefore several key questions remain unanswered: Which algorithms perform better when the embedding dimension is constrained or few triplet comparisons are available? Which ones scale better with increasing sample size or dimension? In our paper, we address these questions and provide an extensive and systematic empirical evaluation of existing algorithms as well as a new neural network approach. We find that simple, relatively unknown, non-convex methods consistently outperform all other algorithms across a broad range of tasks including more recent and elaborate methods based on neural networks or landmark approaches. This finding can be explained by the insight that many of the non-convex optimization approaches do not suffer from local optima.

    "abstract": "The study of strategic or adversarial manipulation of testing data to fool a classifier has attracted much recent attention. Most previous works have focused on two extreme situations where any testing data point either is completely adversarial or always equally prefers the positive label. In this paper, we generalize both of these through a unified framework by considering strategic agents with heterogenous preferences, and introduce the notion of strategic VC-dimension (SVC) to capture the PAC-learnability in our general strategic setup. SVC provably generalizes the recent concept of adversarial VC-dimension (AVC) introduced by Cullina et al. (2018). We instantiate our framework for the fundamental strategic linear classification problem. We fully characterize: (1) the statistical learnability of linear classifiers by pinning down its SVC; (2) its computational tractability by pinning down the complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem. Interestingly, the SVC of linear classifiers is always upper bounded by its standard VC-dimension. This characterization also strictly generalizes the AVC bound for linear classifiers in (Cullina et al., 2018). Finally, we briefly investigate the power of randomization in our strategic classification setup. We show that randomization may strictly increase the accuracy in general, but will not help in the special case of adversarial classification with zero-manipulation-cost",

Occurring, for instance, in distributed 'big data' problems, or when working under multi-party privacy constraints. Many existing approaches resort to approximating the individual sub-posteriors for practical necessity, then find either an analytical approximation or sample approximation of the resulting (product-pooled) posterior. The quality of the posterior approximation for these approaches is poor when the sub-posteriors fall out-with a narrow range of distributional form, such as being approximately Gaussian. Recently, a Fusion approach has been proposed which finds an exact Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior, circumventing the drawbacks of approximate approaches. Unfortunately, existing Fusion approaches have a number of computational limitations, particularly when unifying a large number of sub-posteriors. In this paper, we generalise the theory underpinning existing Fusion approaches, and embed the resulting methodology within a recursive divide-and-conquer sequential Monte Carlo paradigm. This ultimately leads to a competitive Fusion approach, which is robust to increasing numbers of sub-posteriors",

    "title": "MMD Aggregated Two-Sample Test",

    "abstract": "We propose two novel nonparametric two-sample kernel tests based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). First, for a fixed kernel, we construct an MMD test using either permutations or a wild bootstrap, two popular numerical procedures to determine the test threshold. We prove that this test controls the probability of type I error non-asymptotically. Hence, it can be used reliably even in settings with small sample sizes as it remains well-calibrated, which differs from previous MMD tests which only guarantee correct test level asymptotically. When the difference in densities lies in a Sobolev ball, we prove minimax optimality of our MMD test with a specific kernel depending on the smoothness parameter of the Sobolev ball. In practice, this parameter is unknown and, hence, the optimal MMD test with this particular kernel cannot be used. To overcome this issue, we construct an aggregated test, called MMDAgg, which is adaptive to the smoothness parameter. The test power is maximised over the collection of kernels used, without requiring held-out data for kernel selection (which results in a loss of test power), or arbitrary kernel choices such as the median heuristic. We prove that MMDAgg still controls the level non-asymptotically, and achieves the minimax rate over Sobolev balls, up to an iterated logarithmic term. Our guarantees are not restricted to a specific type of kernel, but hold for any product of one-dimensional translation invariant characteristic kernels. We provide a user-friendly parameter-free implementation of MMDAgg using an adaptive collection of bandwidths. We demonstrate that MMDAgg significantly outperforms alternative state-of-the-art MMD-based two-sample tests on synthetic data satisfying the Sobolev smoothness assumption, and that, on real-world image data, MMDAgg closely matches the power of tests leveraging the use of models such as neural networks",

We define a specific type of cluster, called transit cluster, that is guaranteed to preserve the identifiability properties of causal effects under certain conditions. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for finding all transit clusters in a given graph and demonstrate how clustering can simplify the identification of causal effects.

    "abstract": "Statistical models are central to machine learning with broad applicability across a range of downstream tasks. The models are controlled by free parameters that are typically estimated from data by maximum-likelihood estimation or approximations thereof. However, when faced with real-world data sets many of the models run into a critical issue: they are formulated in terms of fully-observed data, whereas in practice the data sets are plagued with missing data. The theory of statistical model estimation from incomplete data is conceptually similar to the estimation of latent-variable models, where powerful tools such as variational inference (VI) exist. However, in contrast to standard latent-variable models, parameter estimation with incomplete data often requires estimating exponentially-many conditional distributions of the missing variables, hence making standard VI methods intractable. We address this gap by introducing variational Gibbs inference (VGI), a new general-purpose method to estimate the parameters of statistical models from incomplete data. We validate VGI on a set of synthetic and real-world estimation tasks, estimating important machine learning models such as variational autoencoders and normalising flows from incomplete data.

We provide the efficient influence functions and the corresponding semiparametric efficiency bounds that hold under these assumptions, and their combinations. We demonstrate that neither of the identification models provides uniformly the most efficient estimation and give conditions under which some bounds are lower than others. We show when semiparametric estimating equation estimators based on influence functions attain the bounds, and study the robustness of the estimators to misspecification of the nuisance models. The theory is complemented with simulation experiments on the finite sample behavior of the estimators. The results obtained are relevant for an analyst facing a choice between several plausible identifying assumptions and corresponding estimators.

Our approach builds on (i) viewing quantization as a measurement kernel and thus a quantized MDP as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP), (ii) utilizing near optimality and convergence results of Q-learning for POMDPs, and (iii) finally, near-optimality of finite state model approximations for MDPs with weakly continuous kernels which we show to correspond to the fixed point of the constructed POMDP.

Very few causal discovery approaches can adequately account for excessive zeros as well as various features of multivariate count data such as overdispersion. In this paper, we propose a new zero-inflated generalized hypergeometric directed acyclic graph (ZiG-DAG) model for inference of causal structure from purely observational zero-inflated count data. The proposed ZiG-DAGs exploit a broad family of generalized hypergeometric probability distributions and are useful for modeling various types of zero-inflated count data with great flexibility. In addition, ZiG-DAGs allow for both linear and nonlinear causal relationships. We prove that the causal structure is identifiable for the proposed ZiG-DAGs via a general proof technique for count data, which is applicable beyond the proposed model for investigating causal identifiability. Score-based algorithms are developed for causal structure learning. Extensive synthetic experiments as well as a real dataset with known ground truth demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against state-of-the-art alternative methods in discovering causal structure from observational zero-inflated count data.

Recently, well-justified infinite-dimensional Bayesian analysis methods have been developed to construct dimension-independent algorithms. However, there are three challenges for these infinite-dimensional Bayesian methods: prior measures usually act as regularizers and are not able to incorporate prior information efficiently; complex noises, such as more practical non-i.i.d. distributed noises, are rarely considered; and time-consuming forward PDE solvers are needed to estimate posterior statistical quantities. To address these issues, an infinite-dimensional inference framework has been proposed based on the infinite-dimensional variational inference method and deep generative models. Specifically, by introducing some measure equivalence assumptions, we derive the evidence lower bound in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide possible parametric strategies that yield a general inference framework called the Variational Inverting Network (VINet). This inference framework can encode prior and noise information from learning examples. In addition, relying on the power of deep neural networks, the posterior mean and variance can be efficiently and explicitly generated in the inference stage. In numerical experiments, we design specific network structures that yield a computable VINet from the general inference framework.

The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but are generally computationally difficult to find since they are solutions of non-monotone games. We show that under mild assumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found efficiently by a variety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and the repeated (stochastic) gradient method. We then establish transparent sufficient conditions for strong monotonicity of the game and use them to develop algorithms for finding Nash equilibria.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising decentralized learning framework and has great potentials in privacy preservation and in lowering the computation load at the cloud. Recent work showed that FedAvg and FedProx -- the two widely-adopted FL algorithms -- fail to reach the stationary points of the global optimization objective even for homogeneous linear regression problems. Further, it is concerned that the common model learned might not generalize well locally at all in the presence of heterogeneity. In this paper, we analyze the convergence and statistical efficiency of FedAvg and FedProx, addressing the above two concerns. Our analysis is based on the standard non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and allows for heterogeneous local data distributions and unbalanced local datasets. We prove that the estimation errors, measured in either the empirical norm or the RKHS norm, decay with a rate of $1/t$ in general and exponentially for finite-rank kernels. In certain heterogeneous settings, these upper bounds also imply that both FedAvg and FedProx achieve the optimal error rate. To further analytically quantify the impact of the heterogeneity at each client, we propose and characterize a novel notion-federation gain, defined as the reduction of the estimation error for a client to join the FL. We discover that when the data heterogeneity is moderate, a client with limited local data can benefit from a common model with a large federation gain. Two new insights introduced by considering the statistical aspect are: (1) requiring the standard bounded dissimilarity is pessimistic for the convergence analysis of FedAvg and FedProx; (2) despite inconsistency of stationary points, their limiting points are unbiased estimators of the underlying truth. Numerical experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings",

    "title": "Buffered Asynchronous SGD for Byzantine Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Distributed learning has become a hot research topic due to its wide application in cluster-based large-scale learning, federated learning, edge computing, and so on. Most traditional distributed learning methods typically assume no failure or attack. However, many unexpected cases, such as communication failure and even malicious attack, may happen in real applications. Hence, Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed learning with failure or attack, has recently attracted much attention. Most existing BL methods are synchronous, which are impractical in some applications due to heterogeneous or offline workers. In these cases, asynchronous BL (ABL) is usually preferred. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called buffered asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (BASGD), for ABL. To the best of our knowledge, BASGD is the first ABL method that can resist non-omniscient attacks without storing any instances on the server. Furthermore, we also propose an improved variant of BASGD, called BASGD with momentum (BASGDm), by introducing local momentum into BASGD. Compared with those methods which need to store instances on server, BASGD and BASGDm have a wider scope of application. Both BASGD and BASGDm are compatible with various aggregation rules. Moreover, both BASGD and BASGDm are proved to be convergent and able to resist failure or attack. Empirical results show that our methods significantly outperform existing ABL baselines when there exists failure or attack on workers",

In this paper, we introduce dynamic policy regret as the performance measure to design algorithms robust to non-stationary environments, which competes algorithms' decisions with a sequence of changing comparators. We propose a novel algorithm for OCO with memory that provably enjoys an optimal dynamic policy regret in terms of time horizon, non-stationarity measure, and memory length. The key technical challenge is how to control the switching cost, the cumulative movements of player's decisions, which is neatly addressed by a novel switching-cost-aware online ensemble approach equipped with a new meta-base decomposition of dynamic policy regret and a careful design of meta-learner and base-learner that explicitly regularizes the switching cost. The results are further applied to tackle non-stationarity in online non-stochastic control (Agarwal et al., 2019), i.e., controlling a linear dynamical system with adversarial disturbance and convex cost functions. We derive a novel gradient-based controller with dynamic policy regret guarantees, which is the first controller provably competitive to a sequence of changing policies for online non-stochastic control",

    "abstract": "Hypergraph generalizations of many graph cut problems and algorithms have recently been introduced to better model data and systems characterized by multiway relationships. Recent work in machine learning and theoretical computer science uses a generalized cut function for a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V,\\mathcal{E})$ that associates each hyperedge $e \\in \\mathcal{E}$ with a splitting function ${\\bf w}_e$, which assigns a penalty to each way of separating the nodes of $e$. When each ${\\bf w}_e$ satisfies ${\\bf w}_e(S) = g(\\lvert S \\rvert)$ for some concave function $g$, previous work has shown how to reduce the generalized hypergraph cut problem to a directed graph cut problem, although the resulting graph may be very dense. We introduce a framework for sparsifying hypergraph-to-graph reductions, where the hypergraph cut function is $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximated by a cut on a directed graph. For $\\varepsilon > 0$ we need at most $O(\\varepsilon^{-1}|e| \\log |e|)$ edges to reduce any hyperedge $e$, while only $O(|e| \\varepsilon^{-1/2} \\log \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ edges are needed to approximate the clique expansion, a widely used heuristic in hypergraph clustering. Our framework leads to improved results for solving cut problems in co-occurrence graphs, decomposable submodular function minimization problems, and localized hypergraph clustering problems",

    "abstract": "The lifelong learning paradigm in machine learning is an attractive alternative to the more prominent isolated learning scheme not only due to its resemblance to biological learning but also its potential to reduce energy waste by obviating excessive model re-training. A key challenge to this paradigm is the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. With the increasing popularity and success of pre-trained models in machine learning, we pose the question: What role does pre-training play in lifelong learning, specifically with respect to catastrophic forgetting? We investigate existing methods in the context of large, pre-trained models and evaluate their performance on a variety of text and image classification tasks, including a large-scale study using a novel data set of 15 diverse NLP tasks. Across all settings, we observe that generic pre-training implicitly alleviates the effects of catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially compared to randomly initialized models. We then further investigate why pre-training alleviates forgetting in this setting. We study this phenomenon by analyzing the loss landscape, finding that pre-trained weights appear to ease forgetting by leading to wider minima. Based on this insight, we propose jointly optimizing for current task loss and loss basin sharpness to explicitly encourage wider basins during sequential fine-tuning. We show that this optimization approach outperforms several state-of-the-art task-sequential continual learning algorithms across multiple settings, occasionally even without retaining a memory that scales in size with the number of tasks",

A main result shows that along the gradient flow induced by a distribution-dependent ordinary differential equation (ODE), the unknown data distribution emerges as the long-time limit. That is, one can uncover the data distribution by simulating the distribution-dependent ODE. Intriguingly, the simulation of the ODE is shown equivalent to the training of generative adversarial networks (GANs). This equivalence provides a new \"cooperative\" view of GANs and, more importantly, sheds new light on the divergence of GANs. In particular, it reveals that the GAN algorithm implicitly minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between two sets of samples, and this MSE fitting alone can cause GANs to diverge. To construct a solution to the distribution-dependent ODE, we first show that the associated nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation has a unique weak solution, by the Crandall-Liggett theorem for differential equations in Banach spaces. Based on this solution to the Fokker-Planck equation, we construct a unique solution to the ODE, using Trevisan's superposition principle.

Inspired by the theoretical analysis, we propose an adaptation augmented model-based policy optimization (AMPO) framework to address the distribution shift problem from the perspectives of feature learning and instance re-weighting, respectively. Specifically, the feature-based variant, namely FAMPO, introduces unsupervised model adaptation to minimize the integral probability metric (IPM) between feature distributions from real and simulated data, while the instance-based variant, termed as IAMPO, utilizes importance sampling to re-weight the real samples used to train the model. Besides model learning, we also investigate how to improve policy optimization in the model usage phase by selecting simulated samples with different probability according to their uncertainty. Extensive experiments on challenging continuous control tasks show that FAMPO and IAMPO, coupled with our model usage technique, achieves superior performance against baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods",

    "abstract": "Electronic healthcare records (EHR) provide a rich resource for healthcare research. An important problem for the efficient utilization of the EHR data is the representation of the EHR features, which include the unstructured clinical narratives and the structured codified data. Matrix factorization-based embeddings trained using the summary-level co-occurrence statistics of EHR data have provided a promising solution for feature representation while preserving patients' privacy. However, such methods do not work well with multi-source data when these sources have overlapping but non-identical features. To accommodate multi-sources learning, we propose a novel word embedding generative model. To obtain multi-source embeddings, we design an efficient Block-wise Overlapping Noisy Matrix Integration (BONMI) algorithm to aggregate the multi-source pointwise mutual information matrices optimally with a theoretical guarantee. Our algorithm can also be applied to other multi-source data integration problems with a similar data structure. A by-product of BONMI is the contribution to the field of matrix completion by considering the missing mechanism other than the entry-wise independent missing. We show that the entry-wise missing assumption, despite its prevalence in the works of matrix completion, is not necessary to guarantee recovery. We prove the statistical rate of our estimator, which is comparable to the rate under independent missingness. Simulation studies show that BONMI performs well under a variety of configurations. We further illustrate the utility of BONMI by integrating multi-lingual multi-source medical text and EHR data to perform two tasks: (i) co-training semantic embeddings for medical concepts in both English and Chinese and (ii) the translation between English and Chinese medical concepts.

To evaluate the performance of segmentation, the Dice and IoU metrics are used to measure the degree of overlap between the ground truth and the predicted segmentation. In this paper, we establish a theoretical foundation of segmentation with respect to the Dice/IoU metrics, including the Bayes rule and Dice-/IoU-calibration, analogous to classification-calibration or Fisher consistency in classification. We prove that the existing thresholding-based framework with most operating losses are not consistent with respect to the Dice/IoU metrics, and thus may lead to a suboptimal solution. To address this pitfall, we propose a novel consistent ranking-based framework, namely RankDice/RankIoU, inspired by plug-in rules of the Bayes segmentation rule. Three numerical algorithms with GPU parallel execution are developed to implement the proposed framework in large-scale and high-dimensional segmentation. We study statistical properties of the proposed framework. We show it is Dice-/IoU-calibrated, and its excess risk bounds and the rate of convergence are also provided. The numerical effectiveness of RankDice/mRankDice is demonstrated in various simulated examples and Fine-annotated CityScapes, Pascal VOC and Kvasir-SEG datasets with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

The proposed model can be applied to the network processes with various underlying structures but with independent edges. As an illustration, an AR(1) stochastic block model has been investigated in depth, which characterizes the latent communities by the transition probabilities over time. This leads to a new and more effective spectral clustering algorithm for identifying the latent communities. We have derived a finite sample condition under which the perfect recovery of the community structure can be achieved by the newly defined spectral clustering algorithm. Furthermore the inference for a change point is incorporated into the AR(1) stochastic block model to cater for possible structure changes. We have derived the explicit error rates for the maximum likelihood estimator of the change-point. Application with three real data sets illustrates both relevance and usefulness of the proposed AR(1) models and the associate inference methods",

However, it has proven widely effective in many problems where there is no reason to assume low-dimensional linear structure in the underlying matrix, as would be imposed by rank constraints. In this manuscript we show that nuclear-norm-based matrix completion attains within a log factor of the minimax rate for estimating the mean structure of matrices that are not necessarily low-rank, but lie in a low-dimensional non-linear manifold, when observations are missing completely at random. In particular, we give upper bounds on the rate of convergence as a function of the number of rows, columns, and observed entries in the matrix, as well as the smoothness and dimension of the non-linear embedding. We additionally give a minimax lower bound: This lower bound agrees with our upper bound (up to a logarithmic factor), which shows that nuclear-norm penalization is (up to log terms) minimax rate optimal for these problems",

An integer program is formulated to optimally trade classification accuracy for rule simplicity. We also consider the fairness setting and extend the formulation to include explicit constraints on two different measures of classification parity: equality of opportunity and equalized odds. Column generation (CG) is used to efficiently search over an exponential number of candidate rules without the need for heuristic rule mining. To handle large data sets, we propose an approximate CG algorithm using randomization. Compared to three recently proposed alternatives, the CG algorithm dominates the accuracy-simplicity trade-off in 8 out of 16 data sets. When maximized for accuracy, CG is competitive with rule learners designed for this purpose, sometimes finding significantly simpler solutions that are no less accurate. Compared to other fair and interpretable classifiers, our method is able to find rule sets that meet stricter notions of fairness with a modest trade-off in accuracy",

    "abstract": "Although being a crucial question for the development of machine learning algorithms, there is still no consensus on how to compare classifiers over multiple data sets with respect to several criteria. Every comparison framework is confronted with (at least) three fundamental challenges: the multiplicity of quality criteria, the multiplicity of data sets and the randomness of the selection of data sets. In this paper, we add a fresh view to the vivid debate by adopting recent developments in decision theory. Based on so-called preference systems, our framework ranks classifiers by a generalized concept of stochastic dominance, which powerfully circumvents the cumbersome, and often even self-contradictory, reliance on aggregates. Moreover, we show that generalized stochastic dominance can be operationalized by solving easy-to-handle linear programs and moreover statistically tested employing an adapted two-sample observation-randomization test. This yields indeed a powerful framework for the statistical comparison of classifiers over multiple data sets with respect to multiple quality criteria simultaneously. We illustrate and investigate our framework in a simulation study and with a set of standard benchmark data sets",

    "abstract": "In the course of playing or solving a game, it is common to face a series of changing other-agent strategies. These strategies often share elements: the set of possible policies to play has overlap, and the policies are sampled at the beginning of play by possibly differing distributions. As it faces the series of strategies, therefore, an agent has the opportunity to transfer its learned play against the previously encountered other-agent policies. We tackle two problems: (1) how can learned responses transfer across changing opponent strategies, and (2) how can this transfer be used to reduced the cumulative cost of learning in game solving. The first problem we characterize as the strategic knowledge transfer problem. For value-based response policies, we demonstrate that Q-Mixing approximately solves this problem by appropriately averaging the component Q-values. Solutions to the first problem can be applied to reduce the computational cost of learning-based game solving algorithms. We offer two algorithms that operate within the Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) framework. Mixed-Oracles reduces the per-policy construction cost by transferring responses from previously encountered opponents. Mixed-Opponents performs strategic knowledge transfer by combining the previously encountered opponents into a single novel policy. Experimental evaluation of these methods on general-sum grid-world games provide evidence about their advantages and limitations in comparison to standard PSRO",

For monotone PDEs (i.e., those given by monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the infinite-dimensional ODE, strongly converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the training time $\\rightarrow \\infty$.

We show that this LP can be significantly pruned, allowing us to compute bounds for significantly larger causal inference problems compared to existing techniques. This pruning procedure allows us to compute bounds in closed form for a special class of problems, including a well-studied family of problems where multiple confounded treatments influence an outcome. We extend our pruning methodology to fractional LPs which compute bounds for causal queries which incorporate additional observations about the unit. We show that our methods provide significant runtime improvement compared to benchmarks in experiments and extend our results to the finite data setting. For causal inference without additional observations, we propose an efficient greedy heuristic that produces high quality bounds, and scales to problems that are several orders of magnitude larger than those for which the pruned LP can be solved",

    "abstract": "Many modern classification algorithms are formulated through the regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework, where the risk is defined based on a loss function. We point out that although the loss function in decision theory is non-negative by definition, the non-negativity of the loss function in ERM is not necessary to be classification-calibrated and to produce a Bayes consistent classifier. We introduce the leaky hockey stick loss (LHS loss), the first negatively divergent margin-based loss function. We prove that the LHS loss is classification-calibrated. When the hinge loss is replaced with the LHS loss in the ERM approach for deriving the kernel support vector machine (SVM), the corresponding optimization problem has a well-defined solution named the kernel leaky hockey stick classifier (LHS classifier). Under mild regularity conditions, we prove that the kernel LHS classifier is Bayes risk consistent. In our theoretical analysis, we overcome multiple challenges caused by the negative divergence of the LHS loss that does not exist in the analysis of the usual kernel machines. For a numerical demonstration, we provide a computationally efficient algorithm to solve the kernel LHS classifier and compare it to the kernel SVM on simulated data and fifteen benchmark data sets. To conclude this work, we further present a class of negatively divergent margin-based loss functions that have similar theoretical properties to those of the LHS loss. Interestingly, the LHS loss can be viewed as a limiting case of this family of negatively divergent margin-based loss functions",

Various strategies, e.g., control variates, adaptive learning rate, momentum technique, etc., have been developed to improve canonical SGD that is of a low convergence rate and the poor generalization in practice. Most of these strategies improve SGD that can be attributed to control the updating direction (e.g., gradient descent or gradient ascent direction), or manipulate the learning rate. Along these two lines, this work first develops and analyzes a novel type of improved powered stochastic gradient descent algorithms from the perspectives of variance reduction, where the updating direction was determined by the Powerball function. Additionally, to bridge the gap between powered stochastic optimization (PSO) and the learning rate, which is now still an open problem for PSO, we propose an adaptive mechanism of updating the learning rate that resorts the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) like scheme, not only for the proposed algorithm, but also for classical PSO algorithms.

    "abstract": "$\\ell_1$-penalized quantile regression ($\\ell_1$-QR) is a useful tool for modeling the relationship between input and output variables when detecting heterogeneous effects in the high-dimensional setting. Hypothesis tests can then be formulated based on the debiased $\\ell_1$-QR estimator that reduces the bias induced by Lasso penalty. However, the non-smoothness of the quantile loss brings great challenges to the computation, especially when the data dimension is high. Recently, the convolution-type smoothed quantile regression (SQR) model has been proposed to overcome such shortcoming, and people developed theory of estimation and variable selection therein. In this work, we combine the debiased method with SQR model and come up with the debiased $\\ell_1$-SQR estimator, based on which we then establish confidence intervals and hypothesis testing in the high-dimensional setup. Theoretically, we provide the non-asymptotic Bahadur representation for our proposed estimator and also the Berry-Esseen bound, which implies the empirical coverage rates for the studentized confidence intervals. Furthermore, we build up the theory of hypothesis testing on both a single variable and a group of variables. Finally, we exhibit extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real data to demonstrate the good performance of our method",

    "title": "Graph Attention Retrospective",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph-based learning is a rapidly growing sub-field of machine learning with applications in social networks, citation networks, and bioinformatics. One of the most popular models is graph attention networks. They were introduced to allow a node to aggregate information from features of neighbor nodes in a non-uniform way, in contrast to simple graph convolution which does not distinguish the neighbors of a node. In this paper, we theoretically study the behaviour of graph attention networks. We prove multiple results on the performance of the graph attention mechanism for the problem of node classification for a contextual stochastic block model. Here, the node features are obtained from a mixture of Gaussians and the edges from a stochastic block model. We show that in an \"easy\" regime, where the distance between the means of the Gaussians is large enough, graph attention is able to distinguish inter-class from intra-class edges. Thus it maintains the weights of important edges and significantly reduces the weights of unimportant edges. Consequently, we show that this implies perfect node classification. In the \"hard\" regime, we show that every attention mechanism fails to distinguish intra-class from inter-class edges. In addition, we show that graph attention convolution cannot (almost) perfectly classify the nodes even if intra-class edges could be separated from inter-class edges. Beyond perfect node classification, we provide a positive result on graph attention's robustness against structural noise in the graph. In particular, our robustness result implies that graph attention can be strictly better than both the simple graph convolution and the best linear classifier of node features. We evaluate our theoretical results on synthetic and real-world data",

    "title": "Importance Sparsification for Sinkhorn Algorithm",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Sinkhorn algorithm has been used pervasively to approximate the solution to optimal transport (OT) and unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problems. However, its practical application is limited due to the high computational complexity. To alleviate the computational burden, we propose a novel importance sparsification method, called Spar-Sink, to efficiently approximate entropy-regularized OT and UOT solutions. Specifically, our method employs natural upper bounds for unknown optimal transport plans to establish effective sampling probabilities, and constructs a sparse kernel matrix to accelerate Sinkhorn iterations, reducing the computational cost of each iteration from $O(n^2)$ to $\\widetilde{O}(n)$ for a sample of size $n$. Theoretically, we show the proposed estimators for the regularized OT and UOT problems are consistent under mild regularity conditions. Experiments on various synthetic data demonstrate Spar-Sink outperforms mainstream competitors in terms of both estimation error and speed. A real-world echocardiogram data analysis shows Spar-Sink can effectively estimate and visualize cardiac cycles, from which one can identify heart failure and arrhythmia. To evaluate the numerical accuracy of cardiac cycle prediction, we consider the task of predicting the end-systole time point using the end-diastole one. Results show Spar-Sink performs as well as the classical Sinkhorn algorithm, requiring significantly less computational time",

    "title": "Improving multiple-try Metropolis with local balancing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo method with the appealing feature of being amenable to parallel computing. At each iteration, it samples several candidates for the next state of the Markov chain and randomly selects one of them based on a weight function. The canonical weight function is proportional to the target density. We show both theoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological behaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase. We propose to instead use weight functions akin to the locally-balanced proposal distributions of Zanella (2020), thus yielding MTM algorithms that do not exhibit those pathological behaviours. To theoretically analyse these algorithms, we study the high-dimensional performance of ideal schemes that can be thought of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates at each iteration, as well as the discrepancy between such schemes and the MTM algorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a strong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the former, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence, while in the latter, the canonical and novel weight functions yield similar performance. Numerical experiments include an application in precision medicine involving a computationally-expensive forward model, which makes the use of parallel computing within MTM iterations beneficial",

    "abstract": "Constructing unbiased estimators from Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) outputs is a difficult problem that has recently received a lot of attention in the statistics and machine learning communities. However, the current unbiased MCMC framework only works when the quantity of interest is an expectation, which excludes many practical applications. In this paper, we propose a general method for constructing unbiased estimators for functions of expectations and extend it to construct unbiased estimators for nested expectations. Our approach combines and generalizes the unbiased MCMC and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods. In contrast to traditional sequential methods, our estimator can be implemented on parallel processors. We show that our estimator has a finite variance and computational complexity and can achieve $\\varepsilon$-accuracy within the optimal $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ computational cost under mild conditions. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits of unbiased estimators in the massively parallel regime",

    "title": "Convex Reinforcement Learning in Finite Trials",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Convex Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a recently introduced framework that generalizes the standard RL objective to any convex (or concave) function of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy. This framework subsumes several applications of practical interest, such as pure exploration, imitation learning, and risk-averse RL, among others. However, the previous convex RL literature implicitly evaluates the agent's performance over infinite realizations (or trials), while most of the applications require excellent performance over a handful, or even just one, trials. To meet this practical demand, we formulate convex RL in finite trials, where the objective is any convex function of the empirical state distribution computed over a finite number of realizations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the setting, which includes an analysis of the importance of non-Markovian policies to achieve optimality, as well as a characterization of the computational and statistical complexity of the problem in various configurations",

Retrieval-augmented models are known to excel at knowledge intensive tasks without the need for as many parameters, but it is unclear whether they work in few-shot settings. In this work we present Atlas, a carefully designed and pre-trained retrieval-augmented language model able to learn knowledge intensive tasks with very few training examples. We perform evaluations on a wide range of tasks, including MMLU, KILT and Natural Questions, and study the impact of the content of the document index, showing that it can easily be updated.

(2021). Our analysis is based on two key insights: 1) a novel $p$-value transformation that preserves both privacy and the mirror conservative property, and 2) a mirror peeling algorithm that allows the construction of the filtration and application of the optimal stopping technique. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed DP-AdaPT performs better compared to the existing differentially private FDR control methods. Compared to the non-private AdaPT, it incurs a small accuracy loss but significantly reduces the computation cost",

We also carry out an empirical study to measure the energy requirements and carbon emissions of its deployment for inference via an API endpoint receiving user queries in real-time.

    "title": "Scalable Real-Time Recurrent Learning Using Columnar-Constructive Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Constructing states from sequences of observations is an important component of reinforcement learning agents. One solution for state construction is to use recurrent neural networks. Back-propagation through time (BPTT), and real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) are two popular gradient-based methods for recurrent learning. BPTT requires complete trajectories of observations before it can compute the gradients and is unsuitable for online updates. RTRL can do online updates but scales poorly to large networks. In this paper, we propose two constraints that make RTRL scalable. We show that by either decomposing the network into independent modules or learning the network in stages, we can make RTRL scale linearly with the number of parameters. Unlike prior scalable gradient estimation algorithms, such as UORO and Truncated-BPTT, our algorithms do not add noise or bias to the gradient estimate. Instead, they trade off the functional capacity of the network for computationally efficient learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over Truncated-BPTT on a prediction benchmark inspired by animal learning and by doing policy evaluation of pre-trained policies for Atari 2600 games",
