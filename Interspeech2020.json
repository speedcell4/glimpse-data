    "title": "On the Comparison of Popular End-to-End Models for Large Scale Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a strong push to transition from hybrid models to end-to-end (E2E) models for automatic speech recognition. Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "End-to-end speech recognition has become popular in recent years, since it can integrate the acoustic, pronunciation and language models into a single neural network. Among end-to-end approaches, attention-based methods have emerged as being superior. For example, Transformer, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The key improvement introduced by Transformer is the utilization of self-attention instead of recurrent mechanisms, enabling both encoder and decoder to capture long-range dependencies with lower computational complexity. In this work, we propose boosting the self-attention ability with a DFSMN memory block, forming the proposed memory equipped self-attention (SAN-M) mechanism. Theoretical and empirical comparisons have been made to demonstrate the relevancy and complementarity between self-attention and the DFSMN memory block. Furthermore, the proposed SAN-M provides an efficient mechanism to integrate these two modules. We have evaluated our approach on the public AISHELL-1 benchmark and an industrial-level 20,000-hour Mandarin speech recognition task. On both tasks, SAN-M systems achieved much better performance than the self-attention based Transformer baseline system. Specially, it can achieve a CER of 6.46% on the AISHELL-1 task even without using any external LM, comfortably outperforming other state-of-the-art systems",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR), such as RNN Transducer (RNN-T) and Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) blend the individual components of a traditional hybrid ASR system — acoustic model, language model, pronunciation model — into a single neural network. While this has some nice advantages, it limits the system to be trained using only paired audio and text. Because of this, E2E models tend to have difficulties with correctly recognizing rare words that are not frequently seen during training, such as entity names. In this paper, we propose modifications to the RNN-T model that allow the model to utilize additional metadata text with the objective of improving performance on these named entity words. We evaluate our approach on an in-house dataset sampled from de-identified public social media videos, which represent an open domain ASR task. By using an attention model to leverage the contextual metadata that accompanies a video, we observe a relative improvement of about 16% in Word Error Rate on Named Entities (WER-NE) for videos with related metadata",

    "abstract": "The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is one of the most widely used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but is parametrized by millions of parameters. This makes it prohibitive for memory-constrained hardware accelerators as the storage demand causes higher dependence on off-chip memory, which bottlenecks latency and power. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM training technique based on hierarchical coarse-grain sparsity (HCGS), which enforces hierarchical structured sparsity by randomly dropping static block-wise connections between layers. HCGS maintains the same hierarchical structured sparsity throughout training and inference; this reduces weight storage for both training and inference hardware systems. We also jointly optimize in-training quantization with HCGS on 2-/3-layer LSTM networks for the TIMIT and TED-LIUM corpora. With 16× structured compression and 6-bit weight precision, we achieved a phoneme error rate (PER) of 16.9% for TIMIT and a word error rate (WER) of 18.9% for TED-LIUM, showing the best trade-off between error rate and LSTM memory compression compared to prior works",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel generalized knowledge distillation framework, with an implicit transfer of privileged information. In our proposed framework, teacher networks are trained with two input branches on pairs of time-synchronous lossless and lossy acoustic features. While one branch of the teacher network processes a privileged view of the data using lossless features, the second branch models a student view, by processing lossy features corresponding to the same data. During the training step, weights of this teacher network are updated using a composite two-part cross entropy loss. The first part of this loss is computed between the predicted output labels of the lossless data and the actual ground truth. The second part of the loss is computed between the predicted output labels of the lossy data and lossless data. In the next step of generating soft labels, only the student view branch of the teacher is used with lossy data. The benefit of this proposed technique is shown on speech signals with long-term time-frequency bandwidth loss due to recording devices and network conditions. Compared to conventional generalized knowledge distillation with privileged information, the proposed method has a relative improvement of 9.5% on both lossless and lossy test sets",

    "abstract": "Attention-based models with convolutional encoders enable faster training and inference than recurrent neural network-based ones. However, convolutional models often require a very large receptive field to achieve high recognition accuracy, which not only increases the parameter size but also the computational cost and run-time memory footprint. A convolutional encoder with a short receptive field length can suffer from looping or skipping problems when the input utterance contains the same words as nearby sentences. We believe that this is due to the insufficient receptive field length, and try to remedy this problem by adding positional information to the convolution-based encoder. It is shown that the word error rate (WER) of a convolutional encoder with a short receptive field size can be reduced significantly by augmenting it with positional information. Visualization results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of adding positional information. The proposed method improves the accuracy of attention models with a convolutional encoder and achieves a WER of 10.60% on TED-LIUMv2 for an end-to-end speech recognition task",

However, the ESF only utilizes the knowledge of fixed beamforming, resulting in limited noise reduction capabilities. In this paper, we propose a DNN-based generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) that can automatically track the target speaker's direction in real time and use the blocking technique to generate reference noise signals to further reduce noise from the fixed beam pointing to the target direction. The coefficients in the proposed GSC are fully learnable and an ASR criterion is used to optimize the entire network. The 4-channel experiments show that the proposed GSC achieves a relative word error rate improvement of 27.0% compared to the raw observation, 20.6% compared to the oracle direction-based traditional GSC, 10.5% compared to the ESF and 7.9% compared to the oracle mask-based generalized eigenvalue (GEV) beamformer",

Further improvements include the replacement of the real-valued masks with the complex-valued masks and the joint training of the complex-mask NN.

We find that a hybrid architecture, namely CNN-TT, is capable of maintaining a good quality performance with a reduced model parameter size. CNN-TT is composed of several convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction to improve speech quality and a tensor-train (TT) output layer on the top to reduce model parameters. We first derive a new upper bound on the generalization power of the convolutional neural network (CNN) based vector-to-vector regression models. Then, we provide experimental evidence on the Edinburgh noisy speech corpus to demonstrate that, in single-channel speech enhancement, CNN outperforms DNN at the expense of a small increment of model sizes. Besides, CNN-TT slightly outperforms the CNN counterpart by utilizing only 32% of the CNN model parameters. Besides, further performance improvement can be attained if the number of CNN-TT parameters is increased to 44% of the CNN model size. Finally, our experiments of multi-channel speech enhancement on a simulated noisy WSJ0 corpus demonstrate that our proposed hybrid CNN-TT architecture achieves better results than both DNN and CNN models in terms of better-enhanced speech qualities and smaller parameter sizes",

To enable gradient propagation all the way, an attentional selection module is proposed, where an attentional weight is learnt for each beamformer and spatial feature sampled over space.

The junior system, which is composed of a neural separator and a post-filter, was constructed using teacher-student learning with the pseudo-target signal generated from the senior system i.e, imitating the output from the senior system (mentoring step). Then, the senior system can be improved by propagating the shared neural separator of the grown-up junior system to the senior system (reverse mentoring step). Since the improved neural separator can give better initial parameters for the statistical BSS model, the senior system can yield more accurate pseudo-target signals, leading to iterative improvement of the pseudo-target signal generator and the neural separator.

However, this technique requires the calculation of a huge spatio-temporal covariance matrix that reflects the statistics of all the sources, which makes the computational cost very high. For computationally efficient optimization, this paper introduces two techniques: one that decomposes the huge covariance matrix into ones for individual sources, and another that decomposes the CBF into sub-filters for estimating individual sources. Both techniques effectively and substantively reduce the size of the covariance matrices that must calculated, and allow us to greatly reduce the computational cost without loss of optimality",

    "abstract": "Characterizing precisely neurophysiological activity involved in natural conversations remains a major challenge. We explore in this paper the relationship between multimodal conversational behavior and brain activity during natural conversations. This is challenging due to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time resolution and to the diversity of the recorded multimodal signals. We use a unique corpus including localized brain activity and behavior recorded during a fMRI experiment when several participants had natural conversations alternatively with a human and a conversational robot. The corpus includes fMRI responses as well as conversational signals that consist of synchronized raw audio and their transcripts, video and eye-tracking recordings. The proposed approach includes a first step to extract discrete neurophysiological time-series from functionally well defined brain areas, as well as behavioral time-series describing specific behaviors. Then, machine learning models are applied to predict neurophysiological time-series based on the extracted behavioral features. The results show promising prediction scores, and specific causal relationships are found between behaviors and the activity in functional brain areas for both conditions, i.e., human-human and human-robot conversations",

    "title": "Neural Entrainment to Natural Speech Envelope Based on Subject Aligned EEG Signals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction of speech envelope from neural signal is a general way to study neural entrainment, which helps to understand the neural mechanism underlying speech processing. Previous neural entrainment studies were mainly based on single-trial neural activities, and the reconstruction accuracy of speech envelope is not high enough, probably due to the interferences from diverse noises such as breath and heartbeat. Considering that such noises independently emerge in the consistent neural processing of the subjects responding to the same speech stimulus, we proposed a method to align and average electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of the subjects for the same stimuli to reduce the noises of neural signals. Pearson correlation of constructed speech envelops with the original ones showed a great improvement comparing to the single-trial based method. Our study improved the correlation coefficient in delta band from around 0.25 to 0.5, where 0.25 was obtained in previous leading studies based on single-trial. The speech tracking phenomenon not only occurred in the commonly reported delta and theta band, but also occurred in the gamma band of EEG. Moreover, the reconstruction accuracy for regular speech was higher than that for the time-reversed speech, suggesting that neural entrainment to natural speech envelope reflects speech semantics",

    "abstract": "Alterations in speech and language are typical signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), considered to be the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, very few studies have pointed out at what stage their speech production is disrupted. To bridge this knowledge gap, the present study focused on lexical retrieval, a specific process during speech production, and investigated how it is affected in cognitively impairment patients with the state-of-the-art analysis of brain functional network. 17 patients with MCI and 20 age-matched controls were invited to complete a primed picture naming task, of which the prime was either semantically related or unrelated to the target. Using electroencephalography (EEG) signals collected during task performance, even-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed, together with the construction of the brain functional network. Results showed that whereas MCI patients did not exhibit significant differences in reaction time and ERP responses, their brain functional network did alter associated with a significant main effect in accuracy. The observation of increased cluster coefficients and characteristic path length indicated deteriorations in global information processing, which provided evidence that deficits in lexical retrieval might have occurred even at the preclinical stage of AD",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Listeners usually have the ability to selectively attend to the target speech while ignoring competing sounds. The mechanism that top-down attention modulates the cortical envelope tracking to speech was proposed to account for this ability. Additional visual input, such as lipreading was considered beneficial for speech perception, especially in noise. However, the effect of audiovisual (AV) congruency on the dynamic properties of cortical envelope tracking activities was not discussed explicitly. And the involvement of cortical regions processing AV speech was unclear. To solve these issues, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants attending to one talker from a mixture for several AV conditions (audio-only, congruent and incongruent). Approaches of temporal response functions (TRFs) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) analysis were utilized to index the cortical envelope tracking for each condition. Comparing with the audio-only condition, both indices were enhanced only for the congruent AV condition, and the enhancement was prominent over both the auditory and visual cortex. In addition, timings of different cortical regions involved in cortical envelope tracking activities were subject to stimulus modality. The present work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms of auditory selective attention when visual input is available",

    "abstract": "Human listeners can recognize target speech streams in complex auditory scenes. The cortical activities can robustly track the amplitude fluctuations of target speech with auditory attentional modulation under a range of signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs). The root-mean-square (RMS) level of the speech signal is a crucial acoustic cue for target speech perception. However, in most studies, the neural-tracking activities were analyzed with the intact speech temporal envelopes, ignoring the characteristic decoding features in different RMS-level-specific speech segments. This study aimed to explore the contributions of high- and middle-RMS-level segments to target speech decoding in noisy conditions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The target stimulus was mixed with a competing speaker at five SMRs (i.e., 6, 3, 0, -3, and -6 dB), and then the temporal response function (TRF) was used to analyze the relationship between neural responses and high/middle-RMS-level segments. Experimental results showed that target and ignored speech streams had significantly different TRF responses under conditions with the high- or middle-RMS-level segments. Besides, the high- and middle-RMS-level segments elicited different TRF responses in morphological distributions. These results suggested that distinct models could be used in different RMS-level-specific speech segments to better decode target speech with corresponding EEG signals",

Each of these functions has been known to accompany specific rhythmic oscillations and be localized in distributed networks. The question is how the brain organizes these spatially and spectrally distinct functional networks in such a temporal precision that endows us with incredible speech abilities. For clarification, this study conducted an oral reading task with natural sentences and collected simultaneously the involved brain waves, eye movements, and speech signals with high-density EEG and eye movement equipment. By examining the regional oscillatory spectral perturbation and modeling the frequency-specific interregional connections, our results revealed a hierarchical oscillatory mechanism, in which gamma oscillation entrains with the fine-structured sensory input while beta oscillation modulated the sensory output. Alpha oscillation mediated between sensory perception and cognitive function via selective suppression. Theta oscillation synchronized local networks for large-scale coordination. Differing from a single function-frequency-correspondence, the coexistence of multi-frequency oscillations was found to be critical for local regions to communicate remotely and diversely in a larger network",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In processing behavioral data from auditory lexical decision, reaction times (RT) can be defined relative to stimulus onset or relative to stimulus offset. Using stimulus onset as the reference invokes models that assumes that relevant processing starts immediately, while stimulus offset invokes models that assume that relevant processing can only start when the acoustic input is complete. It is suggested that EEG recordings can be used to tear apart putative processes. EEG analysis requires some kind of time-locking of epochs, so that averaging of multiple signals does not mix up effects of different processes. However, in many lexical decision experiments the duration of the speech stimuli varies substantially. Consequently, processes tied to stimulus offset are not appropriately aligned and might get lost in the averaging process. In this paper we investigate whether the time course of putative processes such as phonetic encoding, lexical access and decision making can be derived from ERPs and from instantaneous power representations in several frequency bands when epochs are time-locked at stimulus onset or stimulus offset. In addition, we investigate whether time-locking at the moment when the response is given can shed light on the decision process per sé",

    "abstract": "Between 15% to 40% of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients experience incomplete recoveries or provide subjective reports of decreased motor abilities, despite a clinically-determined complete recovery. This demonstrates a need for objective measures capable of detecting subclinical residual mTBI, particularly in return-to-duty decisions for warfighters and return-to-play decisions for athletes. In this paper, we utilize features from recordings of directed speech and gait tasks completed by ten healthy controls and eleven subjects with lingering subclinical impairments from an mTBI. We hypothesize that decreased coordination and precision during fine motor movements governing speech production (articulation, phonation, and respiration), as well as during gross motor movements governing gait, can be effective indicators of subclinical mTBI. Decreases in coordination are measured from correlations of vocal acoustic feature time series and torso acceleration time series. We apply eigenspectra derived from these correlations to machine learning models to discriminate between the two subject groups. The fusion of correlation features derived from acoustic and gait time series achieve an AUC of 0.98. This highlights the potential of using the combination of vocal acoustic features from speech tasks and torso acceleration during a simple gait task as a rapid screening tool for subclinical mTBI ",

Recent studies showed that generic convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on temporal tasks such as speech synthesis and machine translation. In this paper, we explored the use of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for formant tracking. In addition to the conventional implementation, we modified the architecture from three aspects. First, we turned off the \"causal\" mode of dilated convolution, making the dilated convolution see the future speech frames. Second, each hidden layer reused the output information from all the previous layers through dense connection. Third, we also adopted a gating mechanism to alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance by selectively forgetting unimportant information. The model was validated on the open access formant database VTR. The experiment showed that our proposed model was easy to converge and achieved an overall mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 8.2% on speech-labeled frames, compared to three competitive baselines of 9.4% (LSTM), 9.1% (Bi-LSTM) and 8.9% (TCN)",

This paper presents a method to enhance the formants information in the display of spectrogram of the speech signal, especially for high pitched voices. It is well known that in the narrowband spectrogram, the presence of pitch harmonics masks the formant information, whereas in the wideband spectrogram, the formant regions are smeared. Using single frequency filtering (SFF) analysis, we show that the wideband equivalent SFF spectrogram can be modified to enhance the formant information in the display by improving the frequency resolution. For this, we obtain two SFF spectrograms by using single frequency filtering of the speech signal at two closely spaced roots on the real axis in the z-plane. The ratio or difference of the two SFF spectrograms is processed to enhance the formant information in the spectrographic display. This will help in tracking rapidly changing formants and in resolving closely spaced formants. The effect is more pronounced in the case of high-pitched voices, like female and children speech",

It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7× faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24× faster on a CPU than real-time. Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead. Additionally, compared with Parallel WaveGAN, another recently developed high-fidelity vocoder, VocGAN is 6.98× faster on a CPU and exhibits higher MOS",

The recently proposed LPCNet exploits linear predictive coding to represent vocal tract characteristics, and can rapidly synthesize high-quality waveforms with fewer parameters than WaveRNN. For even greater speeds, it is necessary to reduce the time-heavy two GRUs and the DualFC. Although the original work only pruned the first GRU weight, there is room for improvements in the other GRU and DualFC. Accordingly, we use tensor decomposition to reduce these remaining parameters by more than 80%. For the proposed method we demonstrate that 1) it is 1.26 times faster on a CPU, and 2) it matched naturalness of the original LPCNet for acoustic features extracted from natural speech and for those predicted by TTS",

Our PyTorch implementation can be trained using less than 8 GB GPU memory and generates audio samples at a rate of more than 960 kHz on an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Furthermore, even if synthesizing on a CPU, we show that the proposed method is capable of generating 44.1 kHz speech waveform 1.2 times faster than real-time.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In incremental text to speech synthesis (iTTS), the synthesizer produces an audio output before it has access to the entire input sentence. In this paper, we study the behavior of a neural sequence-to-sequence TTS system when used in an incremental mode, i.e. when generating speech output for token n, the system has access to n+k tokens from the text sequence. We first analyze the impact of this incremental policy on the evolution of the encoder representations of token n for different values of k (the lookahead parameter). The results show that, on average, tokens travel 88% of the way to their full context representation with a one-word lookahead and 94% after 2 words. We then investigate which text features are the most influential on the evolution towards the final representation using a random forest analysis. The results show that the most salient factors are related to token length. We finally evaluate the effects of lookahead k at the decoder level, using a MUSHRA listening test. This test shows results that contrast with the above high figures: speech synthesis quality obtained with 2 word-lookahead is significantly lower than the one obtained with the full sentence",

    "abstract": "Neural vocoder, such as WaveGlow, has become an important component in recent high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In this paper, we propose Efficient WaveGlow (EWG), a flow-based generative model serving as an efficient neural vocoder. Similar to WaveGlow, EWG has a normalizing flow backbone where each flow step consists of an affine coupling layer and an invertible 1×1 convolution. To reduce the number of model parameters and enhance the speed without sacrificing the quality of the synthesized speech, EWG improves WaveGlow in three aspects. First, the WaveNet-style transform network in WaveGlow is replaced with an FFTNet-style dilated convolution network. Next, to reduce the computation cost, group convolution is applied to both audio and local condition features. At last, the local condition is shared among the transform network layers in each coupling layer. As a result, EWG can reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required to generate one-second audio and the number of model parameters both by more than 12 times. Experimental results show that EWG can reduce real-world inference time cost by more than twice, without any obvious reduction in the speech quality",

    "title": "Can Auditory Nerve Models Tell us What's Different About WaveNet Vocoded Speech?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, synthetic speech is almost indistinguishable from human speech. The remarkable quality is mainly due to the displacing of signal processing based vocoders in favour of neural vocoders and, in particular, the WaveNet architecture. At the same time, speech synthesis evaluation is still facing difficulties in adjusting to these improvements. These difficulties are even more prevalent in the case of objective evaluation methodologies which do not correlate well with human perception. Yet, an often forgotten use of objective evaluation is to uncover prominent differences between speech signals. Such differences are crucial to decipher the improvement introduced by the use of WaveNet. Therefore, abandoning objective evaluation could be a serious mistake. In this paper, we analyze vocoded synthetic speech re-rendered using WaveNet, comparing it to standard vocoded speech. To do so, we objectively compare spectrograms and neurograms, the latter being the output of AN models. The spectrograms allow us to look at the speech production side, and the neurograms relate to the speech perception path. While we were not yet able to pinpoint how WaveNet and WORLD differ, our results suggest that the Mean-Rate (MR) neurograms in particular warrant further investigation",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning led to human-level performance in single-speaker speech synthesis. However, there are still limitations in terms of speech quality when generalizing those systems into multiple-speaker models especially for unseen speakers and unseen recording qualities. For instance, conventional neural vocoders are adjusted to the training speaker and have poor generalization capabilities to unseen speakers. In this work, we propose a variant of WaveRNN, referred to as speaker conditional WaveRNN (SC-WaveRNN). We target towards the development of an efficient universal vocoder even for unseen speakers and recording conditions. In contrast to standard WaveRNN, SC-WaveRNN exploits additional information given in the form of speaker embeddings. Using publicly-available data for training, SC-WaveRNN achieves significantly better performance over baseline WaveRNN on both subjective and objective metrics. In MOS, SC-WaveRNN achieves an improvement of about 23% for seen speaker and seen recording condition and up to 95% for unseen speaker and unseen condition. Finally, we extend our work by implementing a multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis similar to zero-shot speaker adaptation. In terms of performance, our system has been preferred over the baseline TTS system by 60% over 15.5% and by 60.9% over 32.6%, for seen and unseen speakers, respectively",

The task is to recognize non-native speech from children of various age groups given a limited amount of speech. Moreover, the speech being spontaneous has false starts transcribed as partial words, which in the test transcriptions leads to unseen partial words. To cope with these two challenges, we investigate a data augmentation-based approach. Firstly, we apply the prosody-based data augmentation to supplement the audio data. Secondly, we simulate false starts by introducing partial-word noise in the language modeling corpora creating new words. Acoustic models trained on prosody-based augmented data outperform the models using the baseline recipe or the SpecAugment-based augmentation. The partial-word noise also helps to improve the baseline language model. Our ASR system, a combination of these schemes, is placed third in the evaluation period and achieves the word error rate of 18.71%. Post-evaluation period, we observe that increasing the amounts of prosody-based augmented data leads to better performance. Furthermore, removing low-confidence-score words from hypotheses can lead to further gains. These two improvements lower the ASR error rate to 17.99%",

PLDA works in a pair-wise and independent manner, which may ignore the positional correlation of adjacent speaker embeddings. To address this issue, our previous work proposed the long short-term memory (LSTM) based scoring model, followed by the spectral clustering algorithm.

The weight of edges between nodes is evaluated by the similarities between the pretrained speaker embeddings of speech segments. Speaker attribution then becomes a semi-supervised learning problem on graphs, on which two graph-based methods are applied: label propagation (LP) and graph neural networks (GNNs). The proposed approaches are able to utilize the structural information of the graph to improve speaker attribution performance.

Inspired by the hearing mechanism of human beings, which enables us to concentrate on the interested speaker from the multi-speaker mixed speech by utilizing both audio and context knowledge, this paper explores the contextual information to improve the multi-talker speech recognition. In the proposed architecture, the novel embedding learning model is designed to accurately extract the contextual embedding from the multi-talker mixed speech directly. Then two advanced training strategies are further proposed to improve the new model.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To improve the noise robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR), the generative adversarial network (GAN) based enhancement methods are employed as the front-end processing, which comprise a single adversarial process of an enhancement model and a discriminator. In this single adversarial process, the discriminator is encouraged to find differences between the enhanced and clean speeches, but the distribution of clean speeches is ignored. In this paper, we propose a double adversarial network (DAN) by adding another adversarial generation process (AGP), which forces the discriminator not only to find the differences but also to model the distribution. Furthermore, a functional mean square error (f-MSE) is proposed to utilize the representations learned by the discriminator. Experimental results reveal that AGP and f-MSE are crucial for the enhancement performance on ASR task, which are missed in previous GAN-based methods. Specifically, our DAN achieves 13.00% relative word error rate improvements over the noisy speeches on the test set of CHiME-2, which outperforms several recent GAN-based enhancement methods significantly",

A model that is shift-invariant, also eliminates undesirable side effects like frequency aliasing. When building sequence models, not only should the shift-invariance property be preserved when sampling input features, it must also be respected inside the model itself. Here, we study the impact of the commonly used stacking layer in LSTM-based ASR models and show that aliasing is likely to occur. Experimentally, by adding merely 7 parameters to an existing speech recognition model that has 120 million parameters, we are able to reduce the impact of aliasing. This acts as a regularizer that discards frequencies the model shouldn't be relying on for predictions. Our results show that under conditions unseen at training, we are able to reduce the relative word error rate by up to 5%",

In this paper, we integrate the dereverberation module into the end-to-end multi-channel speech recognition system and explore two different frontend architectures. First, a multi-source mask-based weighted prediction error (WPE) module is incorporated in the frontend for dereverberation. Second, another novel frontend architecture is proposed, which extends the weighted power minimization distortionless response (WPD) convolutional beamformer to perform simultaneous separation and dereverberation. We derive a new formulation from the original WPD, which can handle multi-source input, and replace eigenvalue decomposition with the matrix inverse operation to make the back-propagation algorithm more stable.

A common approach to mitigate this issue consists of equipping the recording devices with multiple microphones that capture the acoustic scene from different perspectives. These multi-channel audio recordings contain specific internal relations between each signal. In this paper, we propose to capture these inter- and intra- structural dependencies with quaternion neural networks, which can jointly process multiple signals as whole quaternion entities. The quaternion algebra replaces the standard dot product with the Hamilton one, thus offering a simple and elegant way to model dependencies between elements. The quaternion layers are then coupled with a recurrent neural network, which can learn long-term dependencies in the time domain.

    "abstract": "The CHiME-6 dataset presents a difficult task with extreme speech overlap, severe noise and a natural speaking style. The gap of the word error rate (WER) is distinct between the audios recorded by the distant microphone arrays and the individual headset microphones. The official baseline exhibits a WER gap of approximately 10% even though the guided source separation (GSS) has achieved considerable WER reduction. In the paper, we make an effort to integrate an improved GSS with a strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end, which bridges the WER gap and achieves substantial ASR performance improvement. Specifically, the proposed GSS is initialized by masks from data-driven deep-learning models, utilizes the spectral information and conducts a selection of the input channels. Meanwhile, we propose a data augmentation technique via random channel selection and deep convolutional neural network-based multi-channel acoustic models for back-end modeling. In the experiments, our framework largely reduced the WER to 34.78%/36.85% on the CHiME-6 development/evaluation set. Moreover, a narrower gap of 0.89%/4.67% was observed between the distant and headset audios.

To overcome this, a novel network architecture is proposed that interleaves inter-channel processing layers and temporal processing layers. The inter-channel processing layers apply a self-attention mechanism along the channel dimension to exploit the information obtained with a varying number of microphones. The temporal processing layers are based on a bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) model and applied to each channel independently. The proposed network leverages information across time and space by stacking these two kinds of layers alternately. Our network estimates time-frequency (TF) masks for each speaker, which are then used to generate enhanced speech signals either with TF masking or beamforming.

To this end, we first perform a neural conversion of speech features into electromyographic time domain features, and then attempt to retrieve the original EMG signal from the time domain features. We propose a feed forward neural network to address the first step of the problem (speech features to EMG features) and a neural network composed of a convolutional block and a bidirectional long short-term memory block to address the second problem (true EMG features to EMG signal). We observe that four out of the five originally proposed time domain features can be estimated reasonably well from the speech signal. Further, the five time domain features are able to predict the original speech-related EMG signal with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.663.

Yoruba is one of the official languages of Nigeria, Benin and Togo, and is spoken in other neighboring African countries and beyond. The corpus consists of over four hours of 48 kHz recordings from 36 male and female volunteers and the corresponding transcriptions that include disfluency annotation. The transcriptions have full diacritization, which is vital for pronunciation and lexical disambiguation. The annotated speech dataset described in this paper is primarily intended for use in text-to-speech systems, serve as adaptation data in automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation, and provide insights in West African corpus linguistics. We demonstrate the use of this corpus in a simple statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) scenario evaluating it against the related languages from the CMU Wilderness dataset and the Yoruba Lagos-NWU corpus",

Standardized evaluation tasks are crucial for creating automatic evaluation metrics for model development; otherwise, comparing the models would require resource-expensive human evaluation. While chatbot challenges have recently managed to provide a plethora of such resources for English, resources in other languages are not yet available. In this work, we provide a starting point for Finnish open-domain chatbot research. We describe our collection efforts to create the Finnish chat conversation corpus FinChat, which is made available publicly. FinChat includes unscripted conversations on seven topics from people of different ages. Using this corpus, we also construct a retrieval-based evaluation task for Finnish chatbot development. We observe that off-the-shelf chatbot models trained on conversational corpora do not perform better than chance at choosing the right answer based on automatic metrics, while humans can do the same task almost perfectly. Similarly, in a human evaluation, responses to questions from the evaluation set generated by the chatbots are predominantly marked as incoherent. Thus, FinChat provides a challenging evaluation set, meant to encourage chatbot development in Finnish",

Channel and gender distortions produce mismatch in such x-vector space where embeddings corresponding to the same language are not grouped in an unique cluster. To control this mismatch, we propose to train the x-vector DNN with metric learning objective functions. Combining a classification loss with the metric learning n-pair loss allows to improve the language recognition performance. Such a system achieves a robustness comparable to a system trained with a domain adaptation loss function but without using the domain information. We also analyze the mismatch due to channel and gender, in comparison to language proximity, in the x-vector space. This is achieved using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy divergence measure between groups of x-vectors. Our analysis shows that using the metric learning loss function reduces gender and channel mismatch in the x-vector space, even for languages only observed on one channel in the train set",

We leveraged the system pipeline from three aspects, including front-end training, back-end processing, and fusion strategy. We implemented many encoder networks for Tasks 1 and 3, such as extended x-vector, multi-task learning x-vector with phonetic information, and our previously presented multi-feature integration structure. Furthermore, our previously proposed length expansion method was used in the test set for Task 1. I-vector systems based on different acoustic features were built for the cross-channel task. For all of three tasks, the same back-end procedure was used for the sake of stability but with different settings for three tasks. Finally, the greedy fusion strategy helped to choose the subsystems to compose the final fusion systems (submitted systems). Cavg values of 0.0263, 0.2813, and 0.1697 from the development set for Task 1, 2, and 3 were obtained from our submitted systems, and we achieved rank 3rd, 3rd, and 1st in the three tasks in this challenge, respectively",

Our results indicate that frame level integration of multiple acoustic features achieves the best performance in both speaker and language recognition tasks, and the multi-feature integration strategy can be generalized in both classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a time-restricted attention mechanism into the frame level integration structure to further improve the performance of multi-feature integration.

The performance relies on its capabilities to discriminate the acoustic properties between the different dialects, even though the input signal contains non-dialectal information such as speaker and channel. In this work, we study how non-dialectal information are encoded inside the end-to-end dialect identification model. We design several proxy tasks to understand the model's ability to represent speech input for differentiating non-dialectal information — such as (a) gender and voice identity of speakers, (b) languages, (c) channel (recording and transmission) quality — and compare with dialectal information (i.e., predicting geographic region of the dialects). By analyzing non-dialectal representations from layers of an end-to-end Arabic dialect identification (ADI) model, we observe that the model retains gender and channel information throughout the network while learning a speaker-invariant representation. Our findings also suggest that the CNN layers of the end-to-end model mirror feature extractors capturing voice-specific information, while the fully-connected layers encode more dialectal information",

All models are trained separately on each dataset (closed task) and on a combination of all datasets (open task), after which we compare if the open task training yields better language embeddings. We begin by training all models end-to-end as discriminative classifiers of spectral features, labeled by language. Then, we extract language embedding vectors from the trained end-to-end models, train separate Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers on the vectors, and compare which model provides best language embeddings for the backend classifier. Our experiments show that the open task condition leads to improved language identification performance on only one of the datasets. In addition, we discovered that increasing x-vector model robustness with random frequency channel dropout significantly reduces its end-to-end classification performance on the test set, while not affecting back-end classification performance of its embeddings. Finally, we note that two baseline models consistently outperformed all other models",

    "abstract": "This article presents a full end-to-end pipeline for Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) using intonation patterns and acoustic representations. Recent approaches to language and dialect identification use linguistic-aware deep architectures that are able to capture phonetic differences amongst languages and dialects. Specifically, in ADI tasks, different combinations of linguistic features and acoustic representations have been successful with deep learning models. The approach presented in this article uses intonation patterns and hybrid residual and bidirectional LSTM networks to learn acoustic embeddings with no additional linguistic information. Results of the experiments show that intonation patterns for Arabic dialects provide sufficient information to achieve state-of-the-art results on the VarDial 17 ADI dataset, outperforming single-feature systems. The pipeline presented is robust to data sparsity, in contrast to other deep learning approaches that require large quantities of data. We conjecture on the importance of sufficient information as a criterion for optimality in a deep learning ADI task, and more generally, its application to acoustic modeling problems. Small intonation patterns, when sufficient in an information-theoretic sense, allow deep learning architectures to learn more accurate speech representations",

In this paper, we present a set of experiments to investigate the impact of domain mismatch on the performance of neural LID systems for a subset of six Slavic languages across two domains (read speech and radio broadcast) and examine two low-level signal descriptors (spectral and cepstral features) for this task. Our experiments show that (1) out-of-domain speech samples severely hinder the performance of neural LID models, and (2) while both spectral and cepstral features show comparable performance within-domain, spectral features show more robustness under domain mismatch. Moreover, we apply unsupervised domain adaptation to minimize the discrepancy between the two domains in our study. We achieve relative accuracy improvements that range from 9% to 77% depending on the diversity of acoustic conditions in the source domain",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Well-designed adversarial examples can easily fool deep speech emotion recognition models into misclassifications. The transferability of adversarial attacks is a crucial evaluation indicator when generating adversarial examples to fool a new target model or multiple models. Herein, we propose a method to improve the transferability of black-box adversarial attacks using lifelong learning. First, black-box adversarial examples are generated by an atrous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This initial model is trained to attack a CNN target model. Then, we adapt the trained atrous CNN attacker to a new CNN target model using lifelong learning. We use this paradigm, as it enables multi-task sequential learning, which saves more memory space than conventional multi-task learning. We verify this property on an emotional speech database, by demonstrating that the updated atrous CNN model can attack all target models which have been learnt, and can better attack a new target model than an attack model trained on one target model only",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose speech emotion recognition (SER) combined with an acoustic-to-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. While acoustic prosodic features are primarily used for SER, textual features are also useful but are error-prone, especially in emotional speech. To solve this problem, we integrate ASR model and SER model in an end-to-end manner. This is done by using an acoustic-to-word model. Specifically, we utilize the states of the decoder in the ASR model with the acoustic features and input them into the SER model. On top of a recurrent network to learn features from this input, we adopt a self-attention mechanism to focus on important feature frames. Finally, we finetune the ASR model on the new dataset using a multi-task learning method to jointly optimize ASR with the SER task. Our model has achieved a 68.63% weighted accuracy (WA) and 69.67% unweighted accuracy (UA) on the IEMOCAP database, which is state-of-the-art performance",

Herein, we study the impact of utilising data from different cultures in a semi-supervised learning approach to label training material for the automatic recognition of arousal and valence. Specifically, we compare the performance of culture-specific affect recognition models trained with manual or cross-cultural automatic annotations. The experiments performed in this work use the dataset released for the Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge of the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019.

    "abstract": "Reliable and generalizable speech emotion recognition (SER) systems have wide applications in various fields including healthcare, customer service, and security and defense. Towards this goal, this study presents a novel teacher-student (T-S) framework for SER, relying on an ensemble of probabilistic predictions of teacher embeddings to train an ensemble of students. We use uncertainty modeling with Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout to create a distribution for the embeddings of an intermediate dense layer of the teacher. The embeddings guiding the student models are derived by sampling from this distribution. The final prediction combines the results obtained by the student ensemble. The proposed model not only increases the prediction performance over the teacher model, but also generates more consistent predictions. As a T-S formulation, the approach allows the use of unlabeled data to improve the performance of the students in a semi-supervised manner. An ablation analysis shows the importance of the MC-based ensemble and the use of unlabeled data. The results show relative improvements in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) up to 4.25% for arousal, 2.67% for valence and 4.98% for dominance from their baseline results. The results also show that the student ensemble decreases the uncertainty in the predictions, leading to more consistent results",

In this paper, we present an analysis of using autoencoders to improve the generalisability of DL based SER solutions. We train a sparse autoencoder using a large speech corpus extracted from social media. Later, the trained encoder part of the autoencoder is reused as the input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the encoder-LSTM modal is re-trained on an aggregation of five commonly used speech emotion corpora. Our evaluation uses an unseen corpus in the training & validation stages to simulate ‘in the wild' condition and analyse the generalisability of our solution. A performance comparison is carried out between the encoder based model and a model trained without an encoder. Our results show that the autoencoder based model improves the unweighted accuracy of the unseen corpus by 8%, indicating autoencoder based pre-training can improve the generalisability of DL based SER solutions",

However, most of the current methods for speech emotion classification rest on the consensus, e. g., one single hard label for an utterance. This labeling principle imposes challenges for system performance considering emotional impurity. In this paper, we recommend the use of emotional profiles (EPs), which provides a time series of segment-level soft labels to capture the subtle blends of emotional cues present across a specific speech utterance. We further propose the emotion profile refinery (EPR), an iterative procedure to update EPs.

We propose a joint F&S model that encodes output state information from Fast model, feeds that to Slow model to improve overall model accuracy from F&S AM. We demonstrate scenarios where individual Fast and Slow models are already available to build the joint F&S model. We apply our work on a large vocabulary ASR task.

S2S models have been used successfully by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) community. The important key factor of S2S is the attention mechanism as it captures the relationships between input and output sequences. The attention weights inform which time frames should be attended to for predicting the output labels. In previous work, we proposed distilling S2S knowledge into connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based models by using the attention characteristics to create pseudo-targets for an auxiliary cross-entropy loss term. This approach can significantly improve CTC models. However, it remained unclear whether our proposal could be used to improve S2S models. In this paper, we extend our previous work to create a strong S2S model, i.e. Transformer with CTC (CTC-Transformer). We utilize Transformer outputs and the source attention weights for making pseudo-targets that contain both the posterior and the timing information of each Transformer output. These pseudo-targets are used to train the shared encoder of the CTC-Transformer through the use of direct feedback from the Transformer-decoder and thus obtain more informative representations. Experiments on public and private datasets to perform various tasks demonstrate that our proposal is also effective for enhancing S2S model training. In particular, on a Japanese ASR task, our best system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art alternative",

The entire model is jointly optimized so that the expected boundaries from MoChA are synchronized with the alignments.

In contrast, sequential transfer learning (fine-tuning) does not require retraining using all data, but may result in catastrophic forgetting of previously-seen dialects. Using data from four english dialects, we demonstrate that by using loss functions that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, sequential transfer learning can be used to train multi-dialect acoustic models that narrow the WER gap between the best (combined training) and worst (fine-tuning) case by up to 65%.

    "abstract": "A common question being raised in automatic speech recognition (ASR) evaluations is how reliable is an observed word error rate (WER) improvement comparing two ASR systems, where statistical hypothesis testing and confidence interval (CI) can be utilized to tell whether this improvement is real or only due to random chance. The bootstrap resampling method has been popular for such significance analysis which is intuitive and easy to use. However, this method fails in dealing with dependent data, which is prevalent in speech world — for example, ASR performance on utterances from the same speaker could be correlated. In this paper we present blockwise bootstrap approach — by dividing evaluation utterances into nonoverlapping blocks, this method resamples these blocks instead of original data. We show that the resulting variance estimator of absolute WER difference between two ASR systems is consistent under mild conditions. We also demonstrate the validity of blockwise bootstrap method on both synthetic and real-world speech data",

    "abstract": "The performances of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are usually evaluated by the metric word error rate (WER) when the manually transcribed data are provided, which are, however, expensively available in the real scenario. In addition, the empirical distribution of WER for most ASR systems usually tends to put a significant mass near zero, making it difficult to simulate with a single continuous distribution. In order to address the two issues of ASR quality estimation (QE), we propose a novel neural zero-inflated model to predict the WER of the ASR result without transcripts. We design a neural zero-inflated beta regression on top of a bidirectional transformer language model conditional on speech features (speech-BERT). We adopt the pre-training strategy of token level masked language modeling for speech-BERT as well, and further fine-tune with our zero-inflated layer for the mixture of discrete and continuous outputs. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance on WER prediction compared with strong baselines",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have enabled the growth of myriad applications such as voice assistants, intent detection, keyword extraction and sentiment analysis. These applications, which are now widely used in the industry, are very sensitive to the errors generated by ASR systems. This could be overcome by having a reliable confidence measurement associated to the predicted output. This work presents a novel method which uses internal neural features of a frozen ASR model to train an independent neural network to predict a softmax temperature value. This value is computed in each decoder time step and multiplied by the logits in order to redistribute the output probabilities. The resulting softmax values corresponding to predicted tokens constitute a more reliable confidence measure. Moreover, this work also studies the effect of teacher forcing on the training of the proposed temperature prediction module. The output confidence estimation shows an improvement of -25.78% in EER and +7.59% in AUC-ROC with respect to the unaltered softmax values of the predicted tokens, evaluated on a proprietary dataset consisting on News and Entertainment videos",

We report results for systems using internal speech decoder features (glass-box), systems without speech decoder features (black-box), and for systems without having access to the ASR system (no-box). The no-box system learns joint acoustic-lexical representation from phoneme recognition results along with MFCC acoustic features to estimate WER. Considering WER per sentence, our no-box system achieves 0.56 Pearson correlation with the reference evaluation and 0.24 root mean square error (RMSE) across 1,400 sentences.

By looking at over 100 hours of spoken AAE, we evaluated two ASR systems — DeepSpeech and Google Cloud Speech — to examine how well habitual \"be\" and its surrounding contexts are inferred. While controlling for local language and acoustic factors such as the amount of context, noise, and speech rate, we found that habitual \"be\" and its surrounding words were more error prone than non-habitual \"be\" and its surrounding words. These findings hold both when the utterance containing \"be\" is processed in isolation and in conjunction with surrounding utterances within speaker turn.

    "abstract": "Languages tend to license segmental contrasts where they are maximally perceptible, i.e. where more perceptual cues to the contrast are available. For strident fricatives, the most salient cues to the presence of voicing are low-frequency energy concentrations and fricative duration, as voiced fricatives are systematically shorter than voiceless ones. Cross-linguistically, the voicing contrast is more frequently realized word-initially than word-finally, as for obstruents. We investigate the phonetic underpinnings of this asymmetric behavior at the word edges, focusing on the availability of durational cues to the contrast in the two positions. To assess segmental duration, listeners rely on temporal markers, i.e. jumps in acoustic energy which demarcate segmental boundaries, thereby facilitating duration discrimination. We conducted an acoustic analysis of word-initial and word-final strident fricatives in American English. We found that temporal markers are sharper at the left edge of word-initial fricatives than at the right edge of word-final fricatives, in terms of absolute value of the intensity slope, in the high-frequency region. These findings allow us to make predictions about the availability of durational cues to the voicing contrast in the two positions",

    "abstract": "It is well known that in Mandarin Chinese (MC) nasal rhymes, non-high vowels /a/ and /e/ undergo Vowel Nasalization and Backness Feature Specification processes to harmonize with the nasal coda in both manner and place of articulation. Specifically, the vowel is specified with the [+front] feature when followed by the /n/ coda and the [+back] feature when followed by /ŋ/. On the other hand, phonetic experiments in recent researches have shown that in MC disyllabic words, the nasal coda tends to undergo place assimilation in the V N.C V context and complete deletion in the V N.V context These processes raises two questions: firstly, will V in V N.C V contexts also change in its backness feature to harmonize with the assimilated nasal coda? Secondly, will the duration of V N reduce significantly after nasal coda deletion in the V N.(G)V context? A production experiment and a perception experiment were designed to answer these two questions. Results show that the vowel backness feature of V is not re-specified despite the appropriate environment, and the duration of V N is not reduced after nasal deletion. The phonological consequences of these findings will be discussed",

Results suggest that VOT cannot differentiate the voiced obstruents from their voiceless counterparts, but the silent closure duration can. There is no voiced aspiration. And breathiness was detected on the vowel following the voiced category of obstruents. An acoustic consequence is that there is no segment for the voiced glottal fricative [ɦ], since it was realized as the breathiness on the following vowel. But interestingly, it is observed that syllables with [ɦ] are longer than their onset-less counterparts",

Second, the vowel inventory is of three sets, monophthongs, diphthongs and retroflex vowels. The classification of monophthongs and diphthongs is based on the phonological distribution of the coda nasal. That is, monophthongs can be followed by a nasal coda, while diphthongs cannot. This argument has introduced two new opening diphthongs /eε ɤʌ/ in the inventory, which have traditionally been described as monophthongs.

Coarticulatory effects on the burst with the following segment also arise, but also have different features in the two varieties.

Results suggest that the er-suffixation in SWM involves suffixing a rhotic schwa [ɚ] to the stem, unlike its counterpart in Beijing and Northeastern Mandarin [5]. Specifically, an entire rime will be replaced with the er-suffix if the nucleus vowel is non-high; only high vocoids will be preserved after the er-suffixation. The \"rhoticity\" is primarily realized as a bunched tongue shape configuration (i.e. a domed tongue body), while the Tongue Tip gesture plays a more limited role in SWM.

Lenis-induced phonation is shown to be breathier with smaller Contact Quotient and faster spectral tilt. Most articulatory and acoustic measures for the aspirated are shown to be patterned with the lenis; However, sporadic difference between the two indicates that the lenis induces more breathier phonation. The diplophonia phonation is argued to be a salient feature for the fortis-head syllables in Yanbian Korean.

In this study, we employed eye activity acquired from low-cost wearable hardware during natural conversation and studied how pupil diameter, blink and gaze direction could assist speech in voice activity and turn-taking prediction. Experiments on a new 2-hour corpus of natural conversational speech between six pairs of speakers wearing near-field eye video glasses revealed that the F1 score for predicting the voicing activity up to 1s ahead of the current instant can be above 80%, for speech and non-speech detection with fused eye and speech features. Further, extracting features synchronously from both interlocutors provides a relative reduction in error rate of 8.5% compared with a system based on just a single speaker. The performance of four turn-taking states based on the predicted voice activity also achieved F1 scores significantly higher than chance level.

However, the fact that these systems produce various versions of the same word with different capitalizations, and even different word segmentations for different case variants when wordpieces (WP) are predicted, leads to multiple problems with contextual ASR. In particular, the size of and time to build contextual models grows considerably with the number of variants per word. In this paper, we propose separating orthographic recognition from capitalization, so that the ASR system first predicts a word, then predicts its capitalization in the form of a capitalization mask. We show that the use of capitalization masks achieves the same low error rate as traditional mixed-case ASR, while reducing the size and compilation time of contextual models. Furthermore, we observe significant improvements in capitalization quality",

It combines real-time speech recognition, temperature measurement, keyword detection, cough detection and other functions in order to convert live audio into actionable structured data to achieve the COVID-19 infection risk assessment function. In order to better evaluate the COVID-19 infection, we propose an end-to-end method for cough detection and classification for our proposed system. It is based on real conversation data from human-robot, which processes speech signals to detect cough and classifies it if detected. The structure of our model are maintained concise to be implemented for real-time applications. And we further embed this entire auxiliary diagnostic system in the robot and it is placed in the communities, hospitals and supermarkets to support COVID-19 testing. The system can be further leveraged within a business rules engine, thus serving as a foundation for real-time supervision and assistance applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Anomia (word finding difficulties) is the hallmark of aphasia an acquired language disorder, most commonly caused by stroke. Assessment of speech performance using picture naming tasks is therefore a key method for identification of the disorder and monitoring patient's response to treatment interventions. Currently, this assessment is conducted manually by speech and language therapists (SLT). Surprisingly, despite advancements in ASR and artificial intelligence with technologies like deep learning, research on developing automated systems for this task has been scarce. Here we present an utterance verification system incorporating a deep learning element that classifies ‘correct'/‘incorrect' naming attempts from aphasic stroke patients. When tested on 8 native British-English speaking aphasics the system's performance accuracy ranged between 83.6% to 93.6%, with a 10 fold cross validation mean of 89.5%. This performance was not only significantly better than one of the leading commercially available ASRs (Google speech-to-text service) but also comparable in some instances with two independent SLT ratings for the same dataset",

When developing AVSR systems for disordered speech characterized by severe degradation of voice quality and large mismatch against normal, it is difficult to record large amounts of high quality audio-visual data. In order to address this issue, a cross-domain visual feature generation approach is proposed in this paper. Audio-visual inversion DNN system constructed using widely available out-of-domain audio-visual data was used to generate visual features for disordered speakers for whom video data is either very limited or unavailable. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest that the proposed cross-domain visual feature generation based AVSR system consistently outperformed the baseline ASR system and AVSR system using original visual features. An overall word error rate reduction of 3.6% absolute (14% relative) was obtained over the previously published best system on the 8 UASpeech dysarthric speakers with audio-visual data of the same task",

Punctuation restoration and disfluency removal of the transcripts can facilitate downstream tasks such as machine translation, information extraction and syntactic analysis [1].

However, task dependencies are normally ignored in the task-specific layers. To model the dependencies of tasks, we propose an attention-based structure in the task-specific layers of the MTL framework incorporating the pretrained BERT (a state-of-art NLP-related model) [4].

For speech utterances of short duration (in the order of a few seconds), speaker embeddings have shown significant dependency on the phonetic content. In this regard, the SdSV Challenge 2020 was organized with a broad focus on systematic benchmark and analysis on varying degrees of phonetic variability on short-duration speaker verification (SdSV).

The submitted systems were composed of TDNN-based and ResNet-based front-end architectures, in which the frame-level features were aggregated with various pooling methods (e.g., statistical, self-attentive, ghostVLAD pooling). Although the conventional pooling methods provide embeddings with a sufficient amount of speaker-dependent information, our experiments show that these embeddings often lack phrase-dependent information.

The main difficulty of the challenge exists in the large degree of varying phonetic overlap between the potentially cross-lingual trials, along with the limited availability of in-domain DeepMine Farsi training data. We introduce domain-balanced hard prototype mining to finetune the state-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN x-vector based speaker embedding extractor. The sample mining technique efficiently exploits speaker distances between the speaker prototypes of the popular AAM-softmax loss function to construct challenging training batches that are balanced on the domain-level. To enhance the scoring of cross-lingual trials, we propose a language-dependent s-norm score normalization. The imposter cohort only contains data from the Farsi target-domain which simulates the enrollment data always being Farsi. In case a Gaussian-Backend language model detects the test speaker embedding to contain English, a cross-language compensation offset determined on the AAM-softmax speaker prototypes is subtracted from the maximum expected imposter mean score.

An autoregressive predictive coding (APC) encoder is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using both out-of-domain (LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb) and in-domain (DeepMine) unlabeled datasets to learn generic, high-level feature representation that encapsulates speaker and phonetic content. Two task-specific decoders were trained using labeled datasets to classify speakers (SID) and phrases (PID). Speaker embeddings extracted from the SID decoder were scored using a PLDA. SID and PID systems were fused at the score level. There is a 51.9% relative improvement in minDCF for our system compared to the fully supervised x-vector baseline on the cross-lingual DeepMine dataset. However, the i-vector/HMM method outperformed the proposed APC encoder-decoder system. A fusion of the x-vector/PLDA baseline and the SID/PLDA scores prior to PID fusion further improved performance by 15% indicating complementarity of the proposed approach to the x-vector system.

    "abstract": "Phonetic Posteriorgrams (PPGs) have received much attention for non-parallel many-to-many Voice Conversion (VC), and have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These methods implicitly assume that PPGs are speaker-independent and contain only linguistic information in an utterance. In practice, however, PPGs carry speaker individuality cues, such as accent, intonation, and speaking rate. As a result, these cues can leak into the voice conversion, making it sound similar to the source speaker. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial learning approach that can remove speaker-dependent information in VC models based on a PPG2speech synthesizer. During training, the encoder output of a PPG2speech synthesizer is fed to a classifier trained to identify the corresponding speaker, while the encoder is trained to fool the classifier. As a result, a more speaker-independent representation is learned. The proposed method is advantageous as it does not require pre-training the speaker classifier, and the adversarial speaker classifier is jointly trained with the PPG2speech synthesizer end-to-end. We conduct objective and subjective experiments on the CSTR VCTK Corpus under standard and one-shot VC conditions.

To prevent the model from overfitting, this paper proposes a novel speaker adaptation framework that decomposes the parameter space of the end-to-end acoustic model into two parts, with the one on predicting spoken content and the other on modeling speaker's voice. The spoken content is represented by phone posteriorgram (PPG) which is speaker independent. By adapting the two sub-modules separately, the overfitting can be alleviated effectively. Moreover, we propose two different adaptation strategies based on whether the data has text annotation. In this way, speaker adaptation can also be performed without text annotations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to embed speaker information to feature vectors at frame level using an attention mechanism, and its application to one-shot voice conversion. A one-shot voice conversion system is a type of voice conversion system where only one utterance from a target speaker is available for conversion. In many one-shot voice conversion systems, a speaker encoder mechanism compresses an utterance of the target speaker into a fixed-size vector for propagating speaker information. However, the obtained representation has lost temporal information related to speaker identities and it could degrade conversion quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel way to embed speaker information using an attention mechanism. Instead of compressing into a fixed-size vector, our proposed speaker encoder outputs a sequence of speaker embedding vectors. The obtained sequence is selectively combined with input frames of a source speaker by an attention mechanism. Finally the obtained time varying speaker information is utilized for a decoder to generate the converted features. Objective evaluation showed that our method reduced the averaged mel-cepstrum distortion to 5.23 dB from 5.34 dB compared with the baseline system. The subjective preference test showed that our proposed system outperformed the baseline one",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data efficient voice cloning aims at synthesizing target speaker's voice with only a few enrollment samples at hand. To this end, speaker adaptation and speaker encoding are two typical methods based on base model trained from multiple speakers. The former uses a small set of target speaker data to transfer the multi-speaker model to target speaker's voice through direct model update, while in the latter, only a few seconds of target speaker's audio directly goes through an extra speaker encoding model along with the multi-speaker model to synthesize target speaker's voice without model update. Nevertheless, the two methods need clean target speaker data. However, the samples provided by user may inevitably contain acoustic noise in real applications. It's still challenging to generating target voice with noisy data. In this paper, we study the data efficient voice cloning problem from noisy samples under the sequence-to-sequence based TTS paradigm. Specifically, we introduce domain adversarial training (DAT) to speaker adaptation and speaker encoding, which aims to disentangle noise from speech-noise mixture. Experiments show that for both speaker adaptation and encoding, the proposed approaches can consistently synthesize clean speech from noisy speaker samples, apparently outperforming the method adopting state-of-the-art speech enhancement module",

    "title": "Gated Multi-Head Attention Pooling for Weakly Labelled Audio Tagging",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has recently been used for weakly labelled audio tagging, where the spectrogram of an audio signal is divided into segments to form instances in a bag, and then the low-dimensional features of these segments are pooled for tagging. The choice of a pooling scheme is the key to exploiting the weakly labelled data. However, the traditional pooling schemes are usually fixed and unable to distinguish the contributions, making it difficult to adapt to the characteristics of the sound events. In this paper, a novel pooling algorithm is proposed for MIL, named gated multi-head attention pooling (GMAP), which is able to attend to the information of events from different heads at different positions. Each head allows the model to learn information from different representation subspaces. Furthermore, in order to avoid the redundancy of multi-head information, a gating mechanism is used to fuse individual head features. The proposed GMAP increases the modeling power of the single-head attention with no computational overhead. Experiments are carried out on Audioset, which is a large-scale weakly labelled dataset, and show superior results to the non-adaptive pooling and the vanilla attention pooling schemes",

Recently, temporal attention mechanisms have been used in CNN to capture the useful information from the relevant time frames for audio classification, especially for weakly labelled data where the onset and offset times of the sound events are not applied. In these methods, however, the inherent spectral characteristics and variations are not explicitly exploited when obtaining the deep features. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel temporal-spectral attention mechanism for CNN to learn discriminative sound representations, which enhances the temporal and spectral features by capturing the importance of different time frames and frequency bands. Parallel branches are constructed to allow temporal attention and spectral attention to be applied respectively in order to mitigate interference from the segments without the presence of sound events.

By penalizing inconsistent predictions under different perturbations, mean teacher methods can exploit large-scale unlabeled data in a self-ensembling manner. In this paper, an effective perturbation based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method is proposed based on the mean teacher method. Specifically, a new independent component (IC) module is proposed to introduce perturbations for different convolutional layers, designed as a combination of batch normalization and dropblock operations. The proposed IC module can reduce correlation between neurons to improve performance. A global statistics pooling based attention module is further proposed to explicitly model inter-dependencies between the time-frequency domain and channels, using statistics information (e.g. mean, standard deviation, max) along different dimensions. This can provide an effective attention mechanism to adaptively re-calibrate the output feature map.

To efficiently train polyphonic sound, we take only one PR for each sound event from a bounding box regressor associated with the attention-LSTM. In the second stage, the original input image and the difference image between adjacent segments are separately pooled according to the coordinate of each PR predicted in the first stage. Then, two feature maps using CNNs are concatenated and processed further by LSTM. Finally, CTC-based n-best SED is conducted using the softmax output from the CNN-LSTM, where CTC has two tokens for each event so that the start and ending time frames are accurately detected. Experiments on SED using DCASE 2019 Task 3 show that the proposed two-stage model with multi-token CTC achieves an F1-score of 97.5%, while the first stage alone and the two-stage model with a conventional CTC yield F1-scores of 91.9% and 95.6%, respectively",

    "abstract": "An essential component of spoken language understanding (SLU) is slot filling: representing the meaning of a spoken utterance using semantic entity labels. In this paper, we develop end-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding systems that directly convert speech input to semantic entities and investigate if these E2E SLU models can be trained solely on semantic entity annotations without word-for-word transcripts. Training such models is very useful as they can drastically reduce the cost of data collection. We created two types of such speech-to-entities models, a CTC model and an attention-based encoder-decoder model, by adapting models trained originally for speech recognition. Given that our experiments involve speech input, these systems need to recognize both the entity label and words representing the entity value correctly. For our speech-to-entities experiments on the ATIS corpus, both the CTC and attention models showed impressive ability to skip non-entity words: there was little degradation when trained on just entities versus full transcripts. We also explored the scenario where the entities are in an order not necessarily related to spoken order in the utterance. With its ability to do re-ordering, the attention model did remarkably well, achieving only about 2% degradation in speech-to-bag-of-entities F1 score",

    "abstract": "Large end-to-end neural open-domain chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. However, research on building such chatbots has typically assumed that the user input is written in nature and it is not clear whether these chatbots would seamlessly integrate with automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to serve the speech modality. We aim to bring attention to this important question by empirically studying the effects of various types of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses in the dialog history on TransferTransfo, a state-of-the-art Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) based neural open-domain dialog system from the NeurIPS ConvAI2 challenge. We observe that TransferTransfo trained on written data is very sensitive to such hypotheses introduced to the dialog history during inference time. As a baseline mitigation strategy, we introduce synthetic ASR hypotheses to the dialog history during training and observe marginal improvements, demonstrating the need for further research into techniques to make end-to-end open-domain chatbots fully speech-robust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses on a state-of-the-art neural open-domain dialog system and we hope it promotes speech-robustness as an evaluation criterion in open-domain dialog",

However, these backbones were originally proposed for image classification, and therefore may not be naturally fit for speaker recognition. Due to the prohibitive complexity of manually exploring the design space, we propose the first neural architecture search approach for the speaker recognition tasks, named as AutoSpeech. Our algorithm first identifies the optimal operation combination in a neural cell and then derives a CNN model by stacking the neural cell for multiple times. The final speaker recognition model can be obtained by training the derived CNN model through the standard scheme. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on both speaker identification and speaker verification tasks using the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Results demonstrate that the derived CNN architectures from the proposed approach significantly outperform current speaker recognition systems based on VGG-M, ResNet-18, and ResNet-34 backbones, while enjoying lower model complexity",

Previous attentive pooling methods employ scalar attention weights for each frame-level vector, resulting in insufficient collection of discriminative information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vector-based attentive pooling method, which adopts vectorial attention instead of scalar attention. The vectorial attention can extract fine-grained features for discriminating different speakers. Besides, the vector-based attentive pooling is extended in a multi-head way for better speaker embeddings from multiple aspects. The proposed pooling method is evaluated with the x-vector baseline system. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets, VoxCeleb and Speaker in the Wild (SITW). The results show that the vector-based attentive pooling method achieves superior performance compared with statistics pooling and three state-of-the-art attentive pooling methods, with the best equal error rate (EER) of 2.734 and 3.062 in SITW as well as the best EER of 2.466 in VoxCeleb",

These limitations motivate researchers for the design of more efficient deep models.

Inspired by the Transformer, we propose a tandem Self-Attention Encoding and Pooling (SAEP) mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non-fixed length speech utterances. SAEP is a stack of identical blocks solely relied on self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks to create vector representation of speakers. This approach encodes short-term speaker spectral features into speaker embeddings to be used in text-independent speaker verification. We have evaluated this approach on both VoxCeleb1 & 2 datasets. The proposed architecture is able to outperform the baseline x-vector, and shows competitive performance to some other benchmarks based on convolutions, with a significant reduction in model size. It employs 94%, 95%, and 73% less parameters compared to ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and x-vector, respectively.

As a standalone component, each input speech is pre-processed by AS-Net first. Furthermore, we incorporate the compression structure and the speaker quality loss to enhance the capacity of the AS-Net.

The model takes a pair of input utterances and generates an utterance-level embedding to represent speaker-specific characteristics in each utterance. The input utterances are expected to have highly similar embeddings if they are from the same speaker. The proposed attention model consists of a self-attention module and a mutual attention module, which jointly contributes to the generation of the utterance-level embedding. The self-attention weights are computed from the utterance itself while the mutual-attention weights are computed with the involvement of the other utterance in the input pairs. As a result, each utterance is represented by a self-attention weighted embedding and a mutual-attention weighted embedding. The similarity between the embeddings is measured by a cosine distance score and a binary classifier output score. The whole model, named Dual Attention Network, is trained end-to-end on Voxceleb database. The evaluation results on Voxceleb 1 test set show that the Dual Attention Network significantly outperforms the baseline systems. The best result yields an equal error rate of 1.6%",

A suite of carefully designed and optimized audio front-end (AFE) algorithms help mitigate these challenges and provide better quality audio signals to the downstream modules such as WW spotter. Since the WW model is trained with the AFE-processed audio data, its performance is sensitive to AFE variations, such as gain changes. In addition, when deploying to new devices, the WW performance is not guaranteed because the AFE is unknown to the WW model. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to use a new feature called ΔLFBE to decouple the AFE gain variations from the WW model. We modified the neural network architectures to accommodate the delta computation, with the feature extraction module unchanged. We evaluate our WW models using data collected from real household settings and showed the models with the ΔLFBE is robust to AFE gain changes. Specifically, when AFE gain changes up to ±12dB, the baseline CNN model lost up to relative 19.0% in false alarm rate or 34.3% in false reject rate, while the model with ΔLFBE demonstrates no performance loss",

    "title": "Smart Tube: A Biofeedback System for Vocal Training and Therapy Through Tube Phonation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Tube phonation, or straw phonation, is a frequently used vocal training technique to improve the efficiency of the vocal mechanism by repeatedly producing a speech sound into a tube or straw. Use of the straw results in a semi-occluded vocal tract in order to maximize the interaction between the vocal fold vibration and the vocal tract. This method requires a voice trainer or therapist to raise the trainee or patient's awareness of the vibrations around his or her mouth, guiding him/her to maximize the vibrations, which results in efficient phonation. A major problem with this process is that the trainer cannot monitor the trainee/patient's vibratory state in a quantitative manner. This study proposes the use of Smart Tube, a straw with an attached acceleration sensor and LED strip that can measure vibrations and provide corresponding feedback through LED lights in real-time. The biofeedback system was implemented using a microcontroller board, Arduino Uno, to minimize cost. Possible system function enhancements include Bluetooth compatibility with personal computers and/or smartphones. Smart Tube can facilitate improved phonation for trainees/patients by providing quantitative visual feedback",

When touching the highlight, the pronunciation of the learner's and the standard's is played. Then the flash animation that describes the movement of the tongue, mouth, and other articulators will be shown to the learner. The learner could repeat the process to improve and excise the pronunciation. The App called ‘SAIT Hànyǔ' can be downloaded at App Store",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In a generation where industries are going through a paradigm shift because of the rampant growth of deep learning, structured data plays a crucial role in the automation of various tasks. Textual structured data is one such kind which is extensively used in systems like chat bots and automatic speech recognition. Unfortunately, a majority of these textual data available is unstructured in the form of user reviews and feedback, social media posts etc. Automating the task of categorizing or clustering these data into meaningful domains will reduce the time and effort needed in building sophisticated human-interactive systems. In this paper, we present a web tool that builds a domain specific data based on a search phrase from a database of highly unstructured user utterances. We also show the usage of Elasticsearch database with custom indexes for full correlated text-search. This tool uses the open sourced Glove model combined with cosine similarity and performs a graph based search to provide semantically and syntactically meaningful corpora. In the end, we discuss its applications with respect to natural language processing",

We evaluate our system and demonstrate that it 1) achieves the estimated complexity around 2.5 GFLOPS and measures real-time factor (RTF) around 0.5 with a single CPU and 2) can attain converted speech with a 3.4 / 5.0 mean opinion score (MOS) of naturalness",
