    "title": "On the Comparison of Popular End-to-End Models for Large Scale Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a strong push to transition from hybrid models to end-to-end (E2E) models for automatic speech recognition. Currently, there are three promising E2E methods: recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T), RNN attention-based encoder-decoder (AED), and Transformer-AED. In this study, we conduct an empirical comparison of RNN-T, RNN-AED, and Transformer-AED models, in both non-streaming and streaming modes. We use 65 thousand hours of Microsoft anonymized training data to train these models. As E2E models are more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount of training data. To the best of our knowledge, no such comprehensive study has been conducted yet. We show that although AED models are stronger than RNN-T in the non-streaming mode, RNN-T is very competitive in streaming mode if its encoder can be properly initialized. Among all three E2E models, transformer-AED achieved the best accuracy in both streaming and non-streaming mode. We show that both streaming RNN-T and transformer-AED models can obtain better accuracy than a highly-optimized hybrid model",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "End-to-end speech recognition has become popular in recent years, since it can integrate the acoustic, pronunciation and language models into a single neural network. Among end-to-end approaches, attention-based methods have emerged as being superior. For example, Transformer, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The key improvement introduced by Transformer is the utilization of self-attention instead of recurrent mechanisms, enabling both encoder and decoder to capture long-range dependencies with lower computational complexity. In this work, we propose boosting the self-attention ability with a DFSMN memory block, forming the proposed memory equipped self-attention (SAN-M) mechanism. Theoretical and empirical comparisons have been made to demonstrate the relevancy and complementarity between self-attention and the DFSMN memory block. Furthermore, the proposed SAN-M provides an efficient mechanism to integrate these two modules. We have evaluated our approach on the public AISHELL-1 benchmark and an industrial-level 20,000-hour Mandarin speech recognition task. On both tasks, SAN-M systems achieved much better performance than the self-attention based Transformer baseline system. Specially, it can achieve a CER of 6.46% on the AISHELL-1 task even without using any external LM, comfortably outperforming other state-of-the-art systems",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR), such as RNN Transducer (RNN-T) and Listen-Attend-Spell (LAS) blend the individual components of a traditional hybrid ASR system — acoustic model, language model, pronunciation model — into a single neural network. While this has some nice advantages, it limits the system to be trained using only paired audio and text. Because of this, E2E models tend to have difficulties with correctly recognizing rare words that are not frequently seen during training, such as entity names. In this paper, we propose modifications to the RNN-T model that allow the model to utilize additional metadata text with the objective of improving performance on these named entity words. We evaluate our approach on an in-house dataset sampled from de-identified public social media videos, which represent an open domain ASR task. By using an attention model to leverage the contextual metadata that accompanies a video, we observe a relative improvement of about 16% in Word Error Rate on Named Entities (WER-NE) for videos with related metadata",

    "abstract": "The long short-term memory (LSTM) network is one of the most widely used recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), but is parametrized by millions of parameters. This makes it prohibitive for memory-constrained hardware accelerators as the storage demand causes higher dependence on off-chip memory, which bottlenecks latency and power. In this paper, we propose a new LSTM training technique based on hierarchical coarse-grain sparsity (HCGS), which enforces hierarchical structured sparsity by randomly dropping static block-wise connections between layers. HCGS maintains the same hierarchical structured sparsity throughout training and inference; this reduces weight storage for both training and inference hardware systems. We also jointly optimize in-training quantization with HCGS on 2-/3-layer LSTM networks for the TIMIT and TED-LIUM corpora. With 16× structured compression and 6-bit weight precision, we achieved a phoneme error rate (PER) of 16.9% for TIMIT and a word error rate (WER) of 18.9% for TED-LIUM, showing the best trade-off between error rate and LSTM memory compression compared to prior works",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel generalized knowledge distillation framework, with an implicit transfer of privileged information. In our proposed framework, teacher networks are trained with two input branches on pairs of time-synchronous lossless and lossy acoustic features. While one branch of the teacher network processes a privileged view of the data using lossless features, the second branch models a student view, by processing lossy features corresponding to the same data. During the training step, weights of this teacher network are updated using a composite two-part cross entropy loss. The first part of this loss is computed between the predicted output labels of the lossless data and the actual ground truth. The second part of the loss is computed between the predicted output labels of the lossy data and lossless data. In the next step of generating soft labels, only the student view branch of the teacher is used with lossy data. The benefit of this proposed technique is shown on speech signals with long-term time-frequency bandwidth loss due to recording devices and network conditions. Compared to conventional generalized knowledge distillation with privileged information, the proposed method has a relative improvement of 9.5% on both lossless and lossy test sets",

    "abstract": "Attention-based models with convolutional encoders enable faster training and inference than recurrent neural network-based ones. However, convolutional models often require a very large receptive field to achieve high recognition accuracy, which not only increases the parameter size but also the computational cost and run-time memory footprint. A convolutional encoder with a short receptive field length can suffer from looping or skipping problems when the input utterance contains the same words as nearby sentences. We believe that this is due to the insufficient receptive field length, and try to remedy this problem by adding positional information to the convolution-based encoder. It is shown that the word error rate (WER) of a convolutional encoder with a short receptive field size can be reduced significantly by augmenting it with positional information. Visualization results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of adding positional information. The proposed method improves the accuracy of attention models with a convolutional encoder and achieves a WER of 10.60% on TED-LIUMv2 for an end-to-end speech recognition task",

However, the ESF only utilizes the knowledge of fixed beamforming, resulting in limited noise reduction capabilities. In this paper, we propose a DNN-based generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) that can automatically track the target speaker's direction in real time and use the blocking technique to generate reference noise signals to further reduce noise from the fixed beam pointing to the target direction. The coefficients in the proposed GSC are fully learnable and an ASR criterion is used to optimize the entire network. The 4-channel experiments show that the proposed GSC achieves a relative word error rate improvement of 27.0% compared to the raw observation, 20.6% compared to the oracle direction-based traditional GSC, 10.5% compared to the ESF and 7.9% compared to the oracle mask-based generalized eigenvalue (GEV) beamformer",

Further improvements include the replacement of the real-valued masks with the complex-valued masks and the joint training of the complex-mask NN.

We find that a hybrid architecture, namely CNN-TT, is capable of maintaining a good quality performance with a reduced model parameter size. CNN-TT is composed of several convolutional layers at the bottom for feature extraction to improve speech quality and a tensor-train (TT) output layer on the top to reduce model parameters. We first derive a new upper bound on the generalization power of the convolutional neural network (CNN) based vector-to-vector regression models. Then, we provide experimental evidence on the Edinburgh noisy speech corpus to demonstrate that, in single-channel speech enhancement, CNN outperforms DNN at the expense of a small increment of model sizes. Besides, CNN-TT slightly outperforms the CNN counterpart by utilizing only 32% of the CNN model parameters. Besides, further performance improvement can be attained if the number of CNN-TT parameters is increased to 44% of the CNN model size. Finally, our experiments of multi-channel speech enhancement on a simulated noisy WSJ0 corpus demonstrate that our proposed hybrid CNN-TT architecture achieves better results than both DNN and CNN models in terms of better-enhanced speech qualities and smaller parameter sizes",

To enable gradient propagation all the way, an attentional selection module is proposed, where an attentional weight is learnt for each beamformer and spatial feature sampled over space.

The junior system, which is composed of a neural separator and a post-filter, was constructed using teacher-student learning with the pseudo-target signal generated from the senior system i.e, imitating the output from the senior system (mentoring step). Then, the senior system can be improved by propagating the shared neural separator of the grown-up junior system to the senior system (reverse mentoring step). Since the improved neural separator can give better initial parameters for the statistical BSS model, the senior system can yield more accurate pseudo-target signals, leading to iterative improvement of the pseudo-target signal generator and the neural separator.

However, this technique requires the calculation of a huge spatio-temporal covariance matrix that reflects the statistics of all the sources, which makes the computational cost very high. For computationally efficient optimization, this paper introduces two techniques: one that decomposes the huge covariance matrix into ones for individual sources, and another that decomposes the CBF into sub-filters for estimating individual sources. Both techniques effectively and substantively reduce the size of the covariance matrices that must calculated, and allow us to greatly reduce the computational cost without loss of optimality",

    "abstract": "Characterizing precisely neurophysiological activity involved in natural conversations remains a major challenge. We explore in this paper the relationship between multimodal conversational behavior and brain activity during natural conversations. This is challenging due to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time resolution and to the diversity of the recorded multimodal signals. We use a unique corpus including localized brain activity and behavior recorded during a fMRI experiment when several participants had natural conversations alternatively with a human and a conversational robot. The corpus includes fMRI responses as well as conversational signals that consist of synchronized raw audio and their transcripts, video and eye-tracking recordings. The proposed approach includes a first step to extract discrete neurophysiological time-series from functionally well defined brain areas, as well as behavioral time-series describing specific behaviors. Then, machine learning models are applied to predict neurophysiological time-series based on the extracted behavioral features. The results show promising prediction scores, and specific causal relationships are found between behaviors and the activity in functional brain areas for both conditions, i.e., human-human and human-robot conversations",

    "title": "Neural Entrainment to Natural Speech Envelope Based on Subject Aligned EEG Signals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Reconstruction of speech envelope from neural signal is a general way to study neural entrainment, which helps to understand the neural mechanism underlying speech processing. Previous neural entrainment studies were mainly based on single-trial neural activities, and the reconstruction accuracy of speech envelope is not high enough, probably due to the interferences from diverse noises such as breath and heartbeat. Considering that such noises independently emerge in the consistent neural processing of the subjects responding to the same speech stimulus, we proposed a method to align and average electroencephalograph (EEG) signals of the subjects for the same stimuli to reduce the noises of neural signals. Pearson correlation of constructed speech envelops with the original ones showed a great improvement comparing to the single-trial based method. Our study improved the correlation coefficient in delta band from around 0.25 to 0.5, where 0.25 was obtained in previous leading studies based on single-trial. The speech tracking phenomenon not only occurred in the commonly reported delta and theta band, but also occurred in the gamma band of EEG. Moreover, the reconstruction accuracy for regular speech was higher than that for the time-reversed speech, suggesting that neural entrainment to natural speech envelope reflects speech semantics",

    "abstract": "Alterations in speech and language are typical signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), considered to be the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, very few studies have pointed out at what stage their speech production is disrupted. To bridge this knowledge gap, the present study focused on lexical retrieval, a specific process during speech production, and investigated how it is affected in cognitively impairment patients with the state-of-the-art analysis of brain functional network. 17 patients with MCI and 20 age-matched controls were invited to complete a primed picture naming task, of which the prime was either semantically related or unrelated to the target. Using electroencephalography (EEG) signals collected during task performance, even-related potentials (ERPs) were analyzed, together with the construction of the brain functional network. Results showed that whereas MCI patients did not exhibit significant differences in reaction time and ERP responses, their brain functional network did alter associated with a significant main effect in accuracy. The observation of increased cluster coefficients and characteristic path length indicated deteriorations in global information processing, which provided evidence that deficits in lexical retrieval might have occurred even at the preclinical stage of AD",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Listeners usually have the ability to selectively attend to the target speech while ignoring competing sounds. The mechanism that top-down attention modulates the cortical envelope tracking to speech was proposed to account for this ability. Additional visual input, such as lipreading was considered beneficial for speech perception, especially in noise. However, the effect of audiovisual (AV) congruency on the dynamic properties of cortical envelope tracking activities was not discussed explicitly. And the involvement of cortical regions processing AV speech was unclear. To solve these issues, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while participants attending to one talker from a mixture for several AV conditions (audio-only, congruent and incongruent). Approaches of temporal response functions (TRFs) and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) analysis were utilized to index the cortical envelope tracking for each condition. Comparing with the audio-only condition, both indices were enhanced only for the congruent AV condition, and the enhancement was prominent over both the auditory and visual cortex. In addition, timings of different cortical regions involved in cortical envelope tracking activities were subject to stimulus modality. The present work provides new insight into the neural mechanisms of auditory selective attention when visual input is available",

    "abstract": "Human listeners can recognize target speech streams in complex auditory scenes. The cortical activities can robustly track the amplitude fluctuations of target speech with auditory attentional modulation under a range of signal-to-masker ratios (SMRs). The root-mean-square (RMS) level of the speech signal is a crucial acoustic cue for target speech perception. However, in most studies, the neural-tracking activities were analyzed with the intact speech temporal envelopes, ignoring the characteristic decoding features in different RMS-level-specific speech segments. This study aimed to explore the contributions of high- and middle-RMS-level segments to target speech decoding in noisy conditions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. The target stimulus was mixed with a competing speaker at five SMRs (i.e., 6, 3, 0, -3, and -6 dB), and then the temporal response function (TRF) was used to analyze the relationship between neural responses and high/middle-RMS-level segments. Experimental results showed that target and ignored speech streams had significantly different TRF responses under conditions with the high- or middle-RMS-level segments. Besides, the high- and middle-RMS-level segments elicited different TRF responses in morphological distributions. These results suggested that distinct models could be used in different RMS-level-specific speech segments to better decode target speech with corresponding EEG signals",

Each of these functions has been known to accompany specific rhythmic oscillations and be localized in distributed networks. The question is how the brain organizes these spatially and spectrally distinct functional networks in such a temporal precision that endows us with incredible speech abilities. For clarification, this study conducted an oral reading task with natural sentences and collected simultaneously the involved brain waves, eye movements, and speech signals with high-density EEG and eye movement equipment. By examining the regional oscillatory spectral perturbation and modeling the frequency-specific interregional connections, our results revealed a hierarchical oscillatory mechanism, in which gamma oscillation entrains with the fine-structured sensory input while beta oscillation modulated the sensory output. Alpha oscillation mediated between sensory perception and cognitive function via selective suppression. Theta oscillation synchronized local networks for large-scale coordination. Differing from a single function-frequency-correspondence, the coexistence of multi-frequency oscillations was found to be critical for local regions to communicate remotely and diversely in a larger network",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In processing behavioral data from auditory lexical decision, reaction times (RT) can be defined relative to stimulus onset or relative to stimulus offset. Using stimulus onset as the reference invokes models that assumes that relevant processing starts immediately, while stimulus offset invokes models that assume that relevant processing can only start when the acoustic input is complete. It is suggested that EEG recordings can be used to tear apart putative processes. EEG analysis requires some kind of time-locking of epochs, so that averaging of multiple signals does not mix up effects of different processes. However, in many lexical decision experiments the duration of the speech stimuli varies substantially. Consequently, processes tied to stimulus offset are not appropriately aligned and might get lost in the averaging process. In this paper we investigate whether the time course of putative processes such as phonetic encoding, lexical access and decision making can be derived from ERPs and from instantaneous power representations in several frequency bands when epochs are time-locked at stimulus onset or stimulus offset. In addition, we investigate whether time-locking at the moment when the response is given can shed light on the decision process per sé",

    "abstract": "Between 15% to 40% of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) patients experience incomplete recoveries or provide subjective reports of decreased motor abilities, despite a clinically-determined complete recovery. This demonstrates a need for objective measures capable of detecting subclinical residual mTBI, particularly in return-to-duty decisions for warfighters and return-to-play decisions for athletes. In this paper, we utilize features from recordings of directed speech and gait tasks completed by ten healthy controls and eleven subjects with lingering subclinical impairments from an mTBI. We hypothesize that decreased coordination and precision during fine motor movements governing speech production (articulation, phonation, and respiration), as well as during gross motor movements governing gait, can be effective indicators of subclinical mTBI. Decreases in coordination are measured from correlations of vocal acoustic feature time series and torso acceleration time series. We apply eigenspectra derived from these correlations to machine learning models to discriminate between the two subject groups. The fusion of correlation features derived from acoustic and gait time series achieve an AUC of 0.98. This highlights the potential of using the combination of vocal acoustic features from speech tasks and torso acceleration during a simple gait task as a rapid screening tool for subclinical mTBI ",

Recent studies showed that generic convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on temporal tasks such as speech synthesis and machine translation. In this paper, we explored the use of Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for formant tracking. In addition to the conventional implementation, we modified the architecture from three aspects. First, we turned off the \"causal\" mode of dilated convolution, making the dilated convolution see the future speech frames. Second, each hidden layer reused the output information from all the previous layers through dense connection. Third, we also adopted a gating mechanism to alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance by selectively forgetting unimportant information. The model was validated on the open access formant database VTR. The experiment showed that our proposed model was easy to converge and achieved an overall mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 8.2% on speech-labeled frames, compared to three competitive baselines of 9.4% (LSTM), 9.1% (Bi-LSTM) and 8.9% (TCN)",

This paper presents a method to enhance the formants information in the display of spectrogram of the speech signal, especially for high pitched voices. It is well known that in the narrowband spectrogram, the presence of pitch harmonics masks the formant information, whereas in the wideband spectrogram, the formant regions are smeared. Using single frequency filtering (SFF) analysis, we show that the wideband equivalent SFF spectrogram can be modified to enhance the formant information in the display by improving the frequency resolution. For this, we obtain two SFF spectrograms by using single frequency filtering of the speech signal at two closely spaced roots on the real axis in the z-plane. The ratio or difference of the two SFF spectrograms is processed to enhance the formant information in the spectrographic display. This will help in tracking rapidly changing formants and in resolving closely spaced formants. The effect is more pronounced in the case of high-pitched voices, like female and children speech",

It also applies the joint conditional and unconditional objective, which has shown successful results in high-resolution image synthesis. In experiments, VocGAN synthesizes speech waveforms 416.7× faster on a GTX 1080Ti GPU and 3.24× faster on a CPU than real-time. Compared with MelGAN, it also exhibits significantly improved quality in multiple evaluation metrics including mean opinion score (MOS) with minimal additional overhead. Additionally, compared with Parallel WaveGAN, another recently developed high-fidelity vocoder, VocGAN is 6.98× faster on a CPU and exhibits higher MOS",

The recently proposed LPCNet exploits linear predictive coding to represent vocal tract characteristics, and can rapidly synthesize high-quality waveforms with fewer parameters than WaveRNN. For even greater speeds, it is necessary to reduce the time-heavy two GRUs and the DualFC. Although the original work only pruned the first GRU weight, there is room for improvements in the other GRU and DualFC. Accordingly, we use tensor decomposition to reduce these remaining parameters by more than 80%. For the proposed method we demonstrate that 1) it is 1.26 times faster on a CPU, and 2) it matched naturalness of the original LPCNet for acoustic features extracted from natural speech and for those predicted by TTS",

Our PyTorch implementation can be trained using less than 8 GB GPU memory and generates audio samples at a rate of more than 960 kHz on an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU. Furthermore, even if synthesizing on a CPU, we show that the proposed method is capable of generating 44.1 kHz speech waveform 1.2 times faster than real-time.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In incremental text to speech synthesis (iTTS), the synthesizer produces an audio output before it has access to the entire input sentence. In this paper, we study the behavior of a neural sequence-to-sequence TTS system when used in an incremental mode, i.e. when generating speech output for token n, the system has access to n+k tokens from the text sequence. We first analyze the impact of this incremental policy on the evolution of the encoder representations of token n for different values of k (the lookahead parameter). The results show that, on average, tokens travel 88% of the way to their full context representation with a one-word lookahead and 94% after 2 words. We then investigate which text features are the most influential on the evolution towards the final representation using a random forest analysis. The results show that the most salient factors are related to token length. We finally evaluate the effects of lookahead k at the decoder level, using a MUSHRA listening test. This test shows results that contrast with the above high figures: speech synthesis quality obtained with 2 word-lookahead is significantly lower than the one obtained with the full sentence",

    "abstract": "Neural vocoder, such as WaveGlow, has become an important component in recent high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In this paper, we propose Efficient WaveGlow (EWG), a flow-based generative model serving as an efficient neural vocoder. Similar to WaveGlow, EWG has a normalizing flow backbone where each flow step consists of an affine coupling layer and an invertible 1×1 convolution. To reduce the number of model parameters and enhance the speed without sacrificing the quality of the synthesized speech, EWG improves WaveGlow in three aspects. First, the WaveNet-style transform network in WaveGlow is replaced with an FFTNet-style dilated convolution network. Next, to reduce the computation cost, group convolution is applied to both audio and local condition features. At last, the local condition is shared among the transform network layers in each coupling layer. As a result, EWG can reduce the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required to generate one-second audio and the number of model parameters both by more than 12 times. Experimental results show that EWG can reduce real-world inference time cost by more than twice, without any obvious reduction in the speech quality",

    "title": "Can Auditory Nerve Models Tell us What's Different About WaveNet Vocoded Speech?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Nowadays, synthetic speech is almost indistinguishable from human speech. The remarkable quality is mainly due to the displacing of signal processing based vocoders in favour of neural vocoders and, in particular, the WaveNet architecture. At the same time, speech synthesis evaluation is still facing difficulties in adjusting to these improvements. These difficulties are even more prevalent in the case of objective evaluation methodologies which do not correlate well with human perception. Yet, an often forgotten use of objective evaluation is to uncover prominent differences between speech signals. Such differences are crucial to decipher the improvement introduced by the use of WaveNet. Therefore, abandoning objective evaluation could be a serious mistake. In this paper, we analyze vocoded synthetic speech re-rendered using WaveNet, comparing it to standard vocoded speech. To do so, we objectively compare spectrograms and neurograms, the latter being the output of AN models. The spectrograms allow us to look at the speech production side, and the neurograms relate to the speech perception path. While we were not yet able to pinpoint how WaveNet and WORLD differ, our results suggest that the Mean-Rate (MR) neurograms in particular warrant further investigation",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning led to human-level performance in single-speaker speech synthesis. However, there are still limitations in terms of speech quality when generalizing those systems into multiple-speaker models especially for unseen speakers and unseen recording qualities. For instance, conventional neural vocoders are adjusted to the training speaker and have poor generalization capabilities to unseen speakers. In this work, we propose a variant of WaveRNN, referred to as speaker conditional WaveRNN (SC-WaveRNN). We target towards the development of an efficient universal vocoder even for unseen speakers and recording conditions. In contrast to standard WaveRNN, SC-WaveRNN exploits additional information given in the form of speaker embeddings. Using publicly-available data for training, SC-WaveRNN achieves significantly better performance over baseline WaveRNN on both subjective and objective metrics. In MOS, SC-WaveRNN achieves an improvement of about 23% for seen speaker and seen recording condition and up to 95% for unseen speaker and unseen condition. Finally, we extend our work by implementing a multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis similar to zero-shot speaker adaptation. In terms of performance, our system has been preferred over the baseline TTS system by 60% over 15.5% and by 60.9% over 32.6%, for seen and unseen speakers, respectively",

The task is to recognize non-native speech from children of various age groups given a limited amount of speech. Moreover, the speech being spontaneous has false starts transcribed as partial words, which in the test transcriptions leads to unseen partial words. To cope with these two challenges, we investigate a data augmentation-based approach. Firstly, we apply the prosody-based data augmentation to supplement the audio data. Secondly, we simulate false starts by introducing partial-word noise in the language modeling corpora creating new words. Acoustic models trained on prosody-based augmented data outperform the models using the baseline recipe or the SpecAugment-based augmentation. The partial-word noise also helps to improve the baseline language model. Our ASR system, a combination of these schemes, is placed third in the evaluation period and achieves the word error rate of 18.71%. Post-evaluation period, we observe that increasing the amounts of prosody-based augmented data leads to better performance. Furthermore, removing low-confidence-score words from hypotheses can lead to further gains. These two improvements lower the ASR error rate to 17.99%",

PLDA works in a pair-wise and independent manner, which may ignore the positional correlation of adjacent speaker embeddings. To address this issue, our previous work proposed the long short-term memory (LSTM) based scoring model, followed by the spectral clustering algorithm.

The weight of edges between nodes is evaluated by the similarities between the pretrained speaker embeddings of speech segments. Speaker attribution then becomes a semi-supervised learning problem on graphs, on which two graph-based methods are applied: label propagation (LP) and graph neural networks (GNNs). The proposed approaches are able to utilize the structural information of the graph to improve speaker attribution performance.

Inspired by the hearing mechanism of human beings, which enables us to concentrate on the interested speaker from the multi-speaker mixed speech by utilizing both audio and context knowledge, this paper explores the contextual information to improve the multi-talker speech recognition. In the proposed architecture, the novel embedding learning model is designed to accurately extract the contextual embedding from the multi-talker mixed speech directly. Then two advanced training strategies are further proposed to improve the new model.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "To improve the noise robustness of automatic speech recognition (ASR), the generative adversarial network (GAN) based enhancement methods are employed as the front-end processing, which comprise a single adversarial process of an enhancement model and a discriminator. In this single adversarial process, the discriminator is encouraged to find differences between the enhanced and clean speeches, but the distribution of clean speeches is ignored. In this paper, we propose a double adversarial network (DAN) by adding another adversarial generation process (AGP), which forces the discriminator not only to find the differences but also to model the distribution. Furthermore, a functional mean square error (f-MSE) is proposed to utilize the representations learned by the discriminator. Experimental results reveal that AGP and f-MSE are crucial for the enhancement performance on ASR task, which are missed in previous GAN-based methods. Specifically, our DAN achieves 13.00% relative word error rate improvements over the noisy speeches on the test set of CHiME-2, which outperforms several recent GAN-based enhancement methods significantly",

A model that is shift-invariant, also eliminates undesirable side effects like frequency aliasing. When building sequence models, not only should the shift-invariance property be preserved when sampling input features, it must also be respected inside the model itself. Here, we study the impact of the commonly used stacking layer in LSTM-based ASR models and show that aliasing is likely to occur. Experimentally, by adding merely 7 parameters to an existing speech recognition model that has 120 million parameters, we are able to reduce the impact of aliasing. This acts as a regularizer that discards frequencies the model shouldn't be relying on for predictions. Our results show that under conditions unseen at training, we are able to reduce the relative word error rate by up to 5%",

In this paper, we integrate the dereverberation module into the end-to-end multi-channel speech recognition system and explore two different frontend architectures. First, a multi-source mask-based weighted prediction error (WPE) module is incorporated in the frontend for dereverberation. Second, another novel frontend architecture is proposed, which extends the weighted power minimization distortionless response (WPD) convolutional beamformer to perform simultaneous separation and dereverberation. We derive a new formulation from the original WPD, which can handle multi-source input, and replace eigenvalue decomposition with the matrix inverse operation to make the back-propagation algorithm more stable.

A common approach to mitigate this issue consists of equipping the recording devices with multiple microphones that capture the acoustic scene from different perspectives. These multi-channel audio recordings contain specific internal relations between each signal. In this paper, we propose to capture these inter- and intra- structural dependencies with quaternion neural networks, which can jointly process multiple signals as whole quaternion entities. The quaternion algebra replaces the standard dot product with the Hamilton one, thus offering a simple and elegant way to model dependencies between elements. The quaternion layers are then coupled with a recurrent neural network, which can learn long-term dependencies in the time domain.

    "abstract": "The CHiME-6 dataset presents a difficult task with extreme speech overlap, severe noise and a natural speaking style. The gap of the word error rate (WER) is distinct between the audios recorded by the distant microphone arrays and the individual headset microphones. The official baseline exhibits a WER gap of approximately 10% even though the guided source separation (GSS) has achieved considerable WER reduction. In the paper, we make an effort to integrate an improved GSS with a strong automatic speech recognition (ASR) back-end, which bridges the WER gap and achieves substantial ASR performance improvement. Specifically, the proposed GSS is initialized by masks from data-driven deep-learning models, utilizes the spectral information and conducts a selection of the input channels. Meanwhile, we propose a data augmentation technique via random channel selection and deep convolutional neural network-based multi-channel acoustic models for back-end modeling. In the experiments, our framework largely reduced the WER to 34.78%/36.85% on the CHiME-6 development/evaluation set. Moreover, a narrower gap of 0.89%/4.67% was observed between the distant and headset audios.

To overcome this, a novel network architecture is proposed that interleaves inter-channel processing layers and temporal processing layers. The inter-channel processing layers apply a self-attention mechanism along the channel dimension to exploit the information obtained with a varying number of microphones. The temporal processing layers are based on a bidirectional long short term memory (BLSTM) model and applied to each channel independently. The proposed network leverages information across time and space by stacking these two kinds of layers alternately. Our network estimates time-frequency (TF) masks for each speaker, which are then used to generate enhanced speech signals either with TF masking or beamforming.

To this end, we first perform a neural conversion of speech features into electromyographic time domain features, and then attempt to retrieve the original EMG signal from the time domain features. We propose a feed forward neural network to address the first step of the problem (speech features to EMG features) and a neural network composed of a convolutional block and a bidirectional long short-term memory block to address the second problem (true EMG features to EMG signal). We observe that four out of the five originally proposed time domain features can be estimated reasonably well from the speech signal. Further, the five time domain features are able to predict the original speech-related EMG signal with a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.663.

Yoruba is one of the official languages of Nigeria, Benin and Togo, and is spoken in other neighboring African countries and beyond. The corpus consists of over four hours of 48 kHz recordings from 36 male and female volunteers and the corresponding transcriptions that include disfluency annotation. The transcriptions have full diacritization, which is vital for pronunciation and lexical disambiguation. The annotated speech dataset described in this paper is primarily intended for use in text-to-speech systems, serve as adaptation data in automatic speech recognition and speech-to-speech translation, and provide insights in West African corpus linguistics. We demonstrate the use of this corpus in a simple statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) scenario evaluating it against the related languages from the CMU Wilderness dataset and the Yoruba Lagos-NWU corpus",

Standardized evaluation tasks are crucial for creating automatic evaluation metrics for model development; otherwise, comparing the models would require resource-expensive human evaluation. While chatbot challenges have recently managed to provide a plethora of such resources for English, resources in other languages are not yet available. In this work, we provide a starting point for Finnish open-domain chatbot research. We describe our collection efforts to create the Finnish chat conversation corpus FinChat, which is made available publicly. FinChat includes unscripted conversations on seven topics from people of different ages. Using this corpus, we also construct a retrieval-based evaluation task for Finnish chatbot development. We observe that off-the-shelf chatbot models trained on conversational corpora do not perform better than chance at choosing the right answer based on automatic metrics, while humans can do the same task almost perfectly. Similarly, in a human evaluation, responses to questions from the evaluation set generated by the chatbots are predominantly marked as incoherent. Thus, FinChat provides a challenging evaluation set, meant to encourage chatbot development in Finnish",

Channel and gender distortions produce mismatch in such x-vector space where embeddings corresponding to the same language are not grouped in an unique cluster. To control this mismatch, we propose to train the x-vector DNN with metric learning objective functions. Combining a classification loss with the metric learning n-pair loss allows to improve the language recognition performance. Such a system achieves a robustness comparable to a system trained with a domain adaptation loss function but without using the domain information. We also analyze the mismatch due to channel and gender, in comparison to language proximity, in the x-vector space. This is achieved using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy divergence measure between groups of x-vectors. Our analysis shows that using the metric learning loss function reduces gender and channel mismatch in the x-vector space, even for languages only observed on one channel in the train set",

We leveraged the system pipeline from three aspects, including front-end training, back-end processing, and fusion strategy. We implemented many encoder networks for Tasks 1 and 3, such as extended x-vector, multi-task learning x-vector with phonetic information, and our previously presented multi-feature integration structure. Furthermore, our previously proposed length expansion method was used in the test set for Task 1. I-vector systems based on different acoustic features were built for the cross-channel task. For all of three tasks, the same back-end procedure was used for the sake of stability but with different settings for three tasks. Finally, the greedy fusion strategy helped to choose the subsystems to compose the final fusion systems (submitted systems). Cavg values of 0.0263, 0.2813, and 0.1697 from the development set for Task 1, 2, and 3 were obtained from our submitted systems, and we achieved rank 3rd, 3rd, and 1st in the three tasks in this challenge, respectively",

Our results indicate that frame level integration of multiple acoustic features achieves the best performance in both speaker and language recognition tasks, and the multi-feature integration strategy can be generalized in both classification tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a time-restricted attention mechanism into the frame level integration structure to further improve the performance of multi-feature integration.

The performance relies on its capabilities to discriminate the acoustic properties between the different dialects, even though the input signal contains non-dialectal information such as speaker and channel. In this work, we study how non-dialectal information are encoded inside the end-to-end dialect identification model. We design several proxy tasks to understand the model's ability to represent speech input for differentiating non-dialectal information — such as (a) gender and voice identity of speakers, (b) languages, (c) channel (recording and transmission) quality — and compare with dialectal information (i.e., predicting geographic region of the dialects). By analyzing non-dialectal representations from layers of an end-to-end Arabic dialect identification (ADI) model, we observe that the model retains gender and channel information throughout the network while learning a speaker-invariant representation. Our findings also suggest that the CNN layers of the end-to-end model mirror feature extractors capturing voice-specific information, while the fully-connected layers encode more dialectal information",

All models are trained separately on each dataset (closed task) and on a combination of all datasets (open task), after which we compare if the open task training yields better language embeddings. We begin by training all models end-to-end as discriminative classifiers of spectral features, labeled by language. Then, we extract language embedding vectors from the trained end-to-end models, train separate Gaussian Naive Bayes classifiers on the vectors, and compare which model provides best language embeddings for the backend classifier. Our experiments show that the open task condition leads to improved language identification performance on only one of the datasets. In addition, we discovered that increasing x-vector model robustness with random frequency channel dropout significantly reduces its end-to-end classification performance on the test set, while not affecting back-end classification performance of its embeddings. Finally, we note that two baseline models consistently outperformed all other models",

    "abstract": "This article presents a full end-to-end pipeline for Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI) using intonation patterns and acoustic representations. Recent approaches to language and dialect identification use linguistic-aware deep architectures that are able to capture phonetic differences amongst languages and dialects. Specifically, in ADI tasks, different combinations of linguistic features and acoustic representations have been successful with deep learning models. The approach presented in this article uses intonation patterns and hybrid residual and bidirectional LSTM networks to learn acoustic embeddings with no additional linguistic information. Results of the experiments show that intonation patterns for Arabic dialects provide sufficient information to achieve state-of-the-art results on the VarDial 17 ADI dataset, outperforming single-feature systems. The pipeline presented is robust to data sparsity, in contrast to other deep learning approaches that require large quantities of data. We conjecture on the importance of sufficient information as a criterion for optimality in a deep learning ADI task, and more generally, its application to acoustic modeling problems. Small intonation patterns, when sufficient in an information-theoretic sense, allow deep learning architectures to learn more accurate speech representations",

In this paper, we present a set of experiments to investigate the impact of domain mismatch on the performance of neural LID systems for a subset of six Slavic languages across two domains (read speech and radio broadcast) and examine two low-level signal descriptors (spectral and cepstral features) for this task. Our experiments show that (1) out-of-domain speech samples severely hinder the performance of neural LID models, and (2) while both spectral and cepstral features show comparable performance within-domain, spectral features show more robustness under domain mismatch. Moreover, we apply unsupervised domain adaptation to minimize the discrepancy between the two domains in our study. We achieve relative accuracy improvements that range from 9% to 77% depending on the diversity of acoustic conditions in the source domain",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Well-designed adversarial examples can easily fool deep speech emotion recognition models into misclassifications. The transferability of adversarial attacks is a crucial evaluation indicator when generating adversarial examples to fool a new target model or multiple models. Herein, we propose a method to improve the transferability of black-box adversarial attacks using lifelong learning. First, black-box adversarial examples are generated by an atrous Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This initial model is trained to attack a CNN target model. Then, we adapt the trained atrous CNN attacker to a new CNN target model using lifelong learning. We use this paradigm, as it enables multi-task sequential learning, which saves more memory space than conventional multi-task learning. We verify this property on an emotional speech database, by demonstrating that the updated atrous CNN model can attack all target models which have been learnt, and can better attack a new target model than an attack model trained on one target model only",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose speech emotion recognition (SER) combined with an acoustic-to-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) model. While acoustic prosodic features are primarily used for SER, textual features are also useful but are error-prone, especially in emotional speech. To solve this problem, we integrate ASR model and SER model in an end-to-end manner. This is done by using an acoustic-to-word model. Specifically, we utilize the states of the decoder in the ASR model with the acoustic features and input them into the SER model. On top of a recurrent network to learn features from this input, we adopt a self-attention mechanism to focus on important feature frames. Finally, we finetune the ASR model on the new dataset using a multi-task learning method to jointly optimize ASR with the SER task. Our model has achieved a 68.63% weighted accuracy (WA) and 69.67% unweighted accuracy (UA) on the IEMOCAP database, which is state-of-the-art performance",

Herein, we study the impact of utilising data from different cultures in a semi-supervised learning approach to label training material for the automatic recognition of arousal and valence. Specifically, we compare the performance of culture-specific affect recognition models trained with manual or cross-cultural automatic annotations. The experiments performed in this work use the dataset released for the Cross-cultural Emotion Sub-challenge of the Audio/Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2019.

    "abstract": "Reliable and generalizable speech emotion recognition (SER) systems have wide applications in various fields including healthcare, customer service, and security and defense. Towards this goal, this study presents a novel teacher-student (T-S) framework for SER, relying on an ensemble of probabilistic predictions of teacher embeddings to train an ensemble of students. We use uncertainty modeling with Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout to create a distribution for the embeddings of an intermediate dense layer of the teacher. The embeddings guiding the student models are derived by sampling from this distribution. The final prediction combines the results obtained by the student ensemble. The proposed model not only increases the prediction performance over the teacher model, but also generates more consistent predictions. As a T-S formulation, the approach allows the use of unlabeled data to improve the performance of the students in a semi-supervised manner. An ablation analysis shows the importance of the MC-based ensemble and the use of unlabeled data. The results show relative improvements in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) up to 4.25% for arousal, 2.67% for valence and 4.98% for dominance from their baseline results. The results also show that the student ensemble decreases the uncertainty in the predictions, leading to more consistent results",

In this paper, we present an analysis of using autoencoders to improve the generalisability of DL based SER solutions. We train a sparse autoencoder using a large speech corpus extracted from social media. Later, the trained encoder part of the autoencoder is reused as the input to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the encoder-LSTM modal is re-trained on an aggregation of five commonly used speech emotion corpora. Our evaluation uses an unseen corpus in the training & validation stages to simulate ‘in the wild' condition and analyse the generalisability of our solution. A performance comparison is carried out between the encoder based model and a model trained without an encoder. Our results show that the autoencoder based model improves the unweighted accuracy of the unseen corpus by 8%, indicating autoencoder based pre-training can improve the generalisability of DL based SER solutions",

However, most of the current methods for speech emotion classification rest on the consensus, e. g., one single hard label for an utterance. This labeling principle imposes challenges for system performance considering emotional impurity. In this paper, we recommend the use of emotional profiles (EPs), which provides a time series of segment-level soft labels to capture the subtle blends of emotional cues present across a specific speech utterance. We further propose the emotion profile refinery (EPR), an iterative procedure to update EPs.

We propose a joint F&S model that encodes output state information from Fast model, feeds that to Slow model to improve overall model accuracy from F&S AM. We demonstrate scenarios where individual Fast and Slow models are already available to build the joint F&S model. We apply our work on a large vocabulary ASR task.

S2S models have been used successfully by the automatic speech recognition (ASR) community. The important key factor of S2S is the attention mechanism as it captures the relationships between input and output sequences. The attention weights inform which time frames should be attended to for predicting the output labels. In previous work, we proposed distilling S2S knowledge into connectionist temporal classification (CTC) based models by using the attention characteristics to create pseudo-targets for an auxiliary cross-entropy loss term. This approach can significantly improve CTC models. However, it remained unclear whether our proposal could be used to improve S2S models. In this paper, we extend our previous work to create a strong S2S model, i.e. Transformer with CTC (CTC-Transformer). We utilize Transformer outputs and the source attention weights for making pseudo-targets that contain both the posterior and the timing information of each Transformer output. These pseudo-targets are used to train the shared encoder of the CTC-Transformer through the use of direct feedback from the Transformer-decoder and thus obtain more informative representations. Experiments on public and private datasets to perform various tasks demonstrate that our proposal is also effective for enhancing S2S model training. In particular, on a Japanese ASR task, our best system outperforms the previous state-of-the-art alternative",

The entire model is jointly optimized so that the expected boundaries from MoChA are synchronized with the alignments.

In contrast, sequential transfer learning (fine-tuning) does not require retraining using all data, but may result in catastrophic forgetting of previously-seen dialects. Using data from four english dialects, we demonstrate that by using loss functions that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, sequential transfer learning can be used to train multi-dialect acoustic models that narrow the WER gap between the best (combined training) and worst (fine-tuning) case by up to 65%.

    "abstract": "A common question being raised in automatic speech recognition (ASR) evaluations is how reliable is an observed word error rate (WER) improvement comparing two ASR systems, where statistical hypothesis testing and confidence interval (CI) can be utilized to tell whether this improvement is real or only due to random chance. The bootstrap resampling method has been popular for such significance analysis which is intuitive and easy to use. However, this method fails in dealing with dependent data, which is prevalent in speech world — for example, ASR performance on utterances from the same speaker could be correlated. In this paper we present blockwise bootstrap approach — by dividing evaluation utterances into nonoverlapping blocks, this method resamples these blocks instead of original data. We show that the resulting variance estimator of absolute WER difference between two ASR systems is consistent under mild conditions. We also demonstrate the validity of blockwise bootstrap method on both synthetic and real-world speech data",

    "abstract": "The performances of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are usually evaluated by the metric word error rate (WER) when the manually transcribed data are provided, which are, however, expensively available in the real scenario. In addition, the empirical distribution of WER for most ASR systems usually tends to put a significant mass near zero, making it difficult to simulate with a single continuous distribution. In order to address the two issues of ASR quality estimation (QE), we propose a novel neural zero-inflated model to predict the WER of the ASR result without transcripts. We design a neural zero-inflated beta regression on top of a bidirectional transformer language model conditional on speech features (speech-BERT). We adopt the pre-training strategy of token level masked language modeling for speech-BERT as well, and further fine-tune with our zero-inflated layer for the mixture of discrete and continuous outputs. The experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance on WER prediction compared with strong baselines",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have enabled the growth of myriad applications such as voice assistants, intent detection, keyword extraction and sentiment analysis. These applications, which are now widely used in the industry, are very sensitive to the errors generated by ASR systems. This could be overcome by having a reliable confidence measurement associated to the predicted output. This work presents a novel method which uses internal neural features of a frozen ASR model to train an independent neural network to predict a softmax temperature value. This value is computed in each decoder time step and multiplied by the logits in order to redistribute the output probabilities. The resulting softmax values corresponding to predicted tokens constitute a more reliable confidence measure. Moreover, this work also studies the effect of teacher forcing on the training of the proposed temperature prediction module. The output confidence estimation shows an improvement of -25.78% in EER and +7.59% in AUC-ROC with respect to the unaltered softmax values of the predicted tokens, evaluated on a proprietary dataset consisting on News and Entertainment videos",

We report results for systems using internal speech decoder features (glass-box), systems without speech decoder features (black-box), and for systems without having access to the ASR system (no-box). The no-box system learns joint acoustic-lexical representation from phoneme recognition results along with MFCC acoustic features to estimate WER. Considering WER per sentence, our no-box system achieves 0.56 Pearson correlation with the reference evaluation and 0.24 root mean square error (RMSE) across 1,400 sentences.

By looking at over 100 hours of spoken AAE, we evaluated two ASR systems — DeepSpeech and Google Cloud Speech — to examine how well habitual \"be\" and its surrounding contexts are inferred. While controlling for local language and acoustic factors such as the amount of context, noise, and speech rate, we found that habitual \"be\" and its surrounding words were more error prone than non-habitual \"be\" and its surrounding words. These findings hold both when the utterance containing \"be\" is processed in isolation and in conjunction with surrounding utterances within speaker turn.

    "abstract": "Languages tend to license segmental contrasts where they are maximally perceptible, i.e. where more perceptual cues to the contrast are available. For strident fricatives, the most salient cues to the presence of voicing are low-frequency energy concentrations and fricative duration, as voiced fricatives are systematically shorter than voiceless ones. Cross-linguistically, the voicing contrast is more frequently realized word-initially than word-finally, as for obstruents. We investigate the phonetic underpinnings of this asymmetric behavior at the word edges, focusing on the availability of durational cues to the contrast in the two positions. To assess segmental duration, listeners rely on temporal markers, i.e. jumps in acoustic energy which demarcate segmental boundaries, thereby facilitating duration discrimination. We conducted an acoustic analysis of word-initial and word-final strident fricatives in American English. We found that temporal markers are sharper at the left edge of word-initial fricatives than at the right edge of word-final fricatives, in terms of absolute value of the intensity slope, in the high-frequency region. These findings allow us to make predictions about the availability of durational cues to the voicing contrast in the two positions",

    "abstract": "It is well known that in Mandarin Chinese (MC) nasal rhymes, non-high vowels /a/ and /e/ undergo Vowel Nasalization and Backness Feature Specification processes to harmonize with the nasal coda in both manner and place of articulation. Specifically, the vowel is specified with the [+front] feature when followed by the /n/ coda and the [+back] feature when followed by /ŋ/. On the other hand, phonetic experiments in recent researches have shown that in MC disyllabic words, the nasal coda tends to undergo place assimilation in the V N.C V context and complete deletion in the V N.V context These processes raises two questions: firstly, will V in V N.C V contexts also change in its backness feature to harmonize with the assimilated nasal coda? Secondly, will the duration of V N reduce significantly after nasal coda deletion in the V N.(G)V context? A production experiment and a perception experiment were designed to answer these two questions. Results show that the vowel backness feature of V is not re-specified despite the appropriate environment, and the duration of V N is not reduced after nasal deletion. The phonological consequences of these findings will be discussed",

Results suggest that VOT cannot differentiate the voiced obstruents from their voiceless counterparts, but the silent closure duration can. There is no voiced aspiration. And breathiness was detected on the vowel following the voiced category of obstruents. An acoustic consequence is that there is no segment for the voiced glottal fricative [ɦ], since it was realized as the breathiness on the following vowel. But interestingly, it is observed that syllables with [ɦ] are longer than their onset-less counterparts",

Second, the vowel inventory is of three sets, monophthongs, diphthongs and retroflex vowels. The classification of monophthongs and diphthongs is based on the phonological distribution of the coda nasal. That is, monophthongs can be followed by a nasal coda, while diphthongs cannot. This argument has introduced two new opening diphthongs /eε ɤʌ/ in the inventory, which have traditionally been described as monophthongs.

Coarticulatory effects on the burst with the following segment also arise, but also have different features in the two varieties.

Results suggest that the er-suffixation in SWM involves suffixing a rhotic schwa [ɚ] to the stem, unlike its counterpart in Beijing and Northeastern Mandarin [5]. Specifically, an entire rime will be replaced with the er-suffix if the nucleus vowel is non-high; only high vocoids will be preserved after the er-suffixation. The \"rhoticity\" is primarily realized as a bunched tongue shape configuration (i.e. a domed tongue body), while the Tongue Tip gesture plays a more limited role in SWM.

Lenis-induced phonation is shown to be breathier with smaller Contact Quotient and faster spectral tilt. Most articulatory and acoustic measures for the aspirated are shown to be patterned with the lenis; However, sporadic difference between the two indicates that the lenis induces more breathier phonation. The diplophonia phonation is argued to be a salient feature for the fortis-head syllables in Yanbian Korean.

In this study, we employed eye activity acquired from low-cost wearable hardware during natural conversation and studied how pupil diameter, blink and gaze direction could assist speech in voice activity and turn-taking prediction. Experiments on a new 2-hour corpus of natural conversational speech between six pairs of speakers wearing near-field eye video glasses revealed that the F1 score for predicting the voicing activity up to 1s ahead of the current instant can be above 80%, for speech and non-speech detection with fused eye and speech features. Further, extracting features synchronously from both interlocutors provides a relative reduction in error rate of 8.5% compared with a system based on just a single speaker. The performance of four turn-taking states based on the predicted voice activity also achieved F1 scores significantly higher than chance level.

However, the fact that these systems produce various versions of the same word with different capitalizations, and even different word segmentations for different case variants when wordpieces (WP) are predicted, leads to multiple problems with contextual ASR. In particular, the size of and time to build contextual models grows considerably with the number of variants per word. In this paper, we propose separating orthographic recognition from capitalization, so that the ASR system first predicts a word, then predicts its capitalization in the form of a capitalization mask. We show that the use of capitalization masks achieves the same low error rate as traditional mixed-case ASR, while reducing the size and compilation time of contextual models. Furthermore, we observe significant improvements in capitalization quality",

It combines real-time speech recognition, temperature measurement, keyword detection, cough detection and other functions in order to convert live audio into actionable structured data to achieve the COVID-19 infection risk assessment function. In order to better evaluate the COVID-19 infection, we propose an end-to-end method for cough detection and classification for our proposed system. It is based on real conversation data from human-robot, which processes speech signals to detect cough and classifies it if detected. The structure of our model are maintained concise to be implemented for real-time applications. And we further embed this entire auxiliary diagnostic system in the robot and it is placed in the communities, hospitals and supermarkets to support COVID-19 testing. The system can be further leveraged within a business rules engine, thus serving as a foundation for real-time supervision and assistance applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Anomia (word finding difficulties) is the hallmark of aphasia an acquired language disorder, most commonly caused by stroke. Assessment of speech performance using picture naming tasks is therefore a key method for identification of the disorder and monitoring patient's response to treatment interventions. Currently, this assessment is conducted manually by speech and language therapists (SLT). Surprisingly, despite advancements in ASR and artificial intelligence with technologies like deep learning, research on developing automated systems for this task has been scarce. Here we present an utterance verification system incorporating a deep learning element that classifies ‘correct'/‘incorrect' naming attempts from aphasic stroke patients. When tested on 8 native British-English speaking aphasics the system's performance accuracy ranged between 83.6% to 93.6%, with a 10 fold cross validation mean of 89.5%. This performance was not only significantly better than one of the leading commercially available ASRs (Google speech-to-text service) but also comparable in some instances with two independent SLT ratings for the same dataset",

When developing AVSR systems for disordered speech characterized by severe degradation of voice quality and large mismatch against normal, it is difficult to record large amounts of high quality audio-visual data. In order to address this issue, a cross-domain visual feature generation approach is proposed in this paper. Audio-visual inversion DNN system constructed using widely available out-of-domain audio-visual data was used to generate visual features for disordered speakers for whom video data is either very limited or unavailable. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest that the proposed cross-domain visual feature generation based AVSR system consistently outperformed the baseline ASR system and AVSR system using original visual features. An overall word error rate reduction of 3.6% absolute (14% relative) was obtained over the previously published best system on the 8 UASpeech dysarthric speakers with audio-visual data of the same task",

Punctuation restoration and disfluency removal of the transcripts can facilitate downstream tasks such as machine translation, information extraction and syntactic analysis [1].

However, task dependencies are normally ignored in the task-specific layers. To model the dependencies of tasks, we propose an attention-based structure in the task-specific layers of the MTL framework incorporating the pretrained BERT (a state-of-art NLP-related model) [4].

For speech utterances of short duration (in the order of a few seconds), speaker embeddings have shown significant dependency on the phonetic content. In this regard, the SdSV Challenge 2020 was organized with a broad focus on systematic benchmark and analysis on varying degrees of phonetic variability on short-duration speaker verification (SdSV).

The submitted systems were composed of TDNN-based and ResNet-based front-end architectures, in which the frame-level features were aggregated with various pooling methods (e.g., statistical, self-attentive, ghostVLAD pooling). Although the conventional pooling methods provide embeddings with a sufficient amount of speaker-dependent information, our experiments show that these embeddings often lack phrase-dependent information.

The main difficulty of the challenge exists in the large degree of varying phonetic overlap between the potentially cross-lingual trials, along with the limited availability of in-domain DeepMine Farsi training data. We introduce domain-balanced hard prototype mining to finetune the state-of-the-art ECAPA-TDNN x-vector based speaker embedding extractor. The sample mining technique efficiently exploits speaker distances between the speaker prototypes of the popular AAM-softmax loss function to construct challenging training batches that are balanced on the domain-level. To enhance the scoring of cross-lingual trials, we propose a language-dependent s-norm score normalization. The imposter cohort only contains data from the Farsi target-domain which simulates the enrollment data always being Farsi. In case a Gaussian-Backend language model detects the test speaker embedding to contain English, a cross-language compensation offset determined on the AAM-softmax speaker prototypes is subtracted from the maximum expected imposter mean score.

An autoregressive predictive coding (APC) encoder is pre-trained in an unsupervised manner using both out-of-domain (LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb) and in-domain (DeepMine) unlabeled datasets to learn generic, high-level feature representation that encapsulates speaker and phonetic content. Two task-specific decoders were trained using labeled datasets to classify speakers (SID) and phrases (PID). Speaker embeddings extracted from the SID decoder were scored using a PLDA. SID and PID systems were fused at the score level. There is a 51.9% relative improvement in minDCF for our system compared to the fully supervised x-vector baseline on the cross-lingual DeepMine dataset. However, the i-vector/HMM method outperformed the proposed APC encoder-decoder system. A fusion of the x-vector/PLDA baseline and the SID/PLDA scores prior to PID fusion further improved performance by 15% indicating complementarity of the proposed approach to the x-vector system.

    "abstract": "Phonetic Posteriorgrams (PPGs) have received much attention for non-parallel many-to-many Voice Conversion (VC), and have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These methods implicitly assume that PPGs are speaker-independent and contain only linguistic information in an utterance. In practice, however, PPGs carry speaker individuality cues, such as accent, intonation, and speaking rate. As a result, these cues can leak into the voice conversion, making it sound similar to the source speaker. To address this issue, we propose an adversarial learning approach that can remove speaker-dependent information in VC models based on a PPG2speech synthesizer. During training, the encoder output of a PPG2speech synthesizer is fed to a classifier trained to identify the corresponding speaker, while the encoder is trained to fool the classifier. As a result, a more speaker-independent representation is learned. The proposed method is advantageous as it does not require pre-training the speaker classifier, and the adversarial speaker classifier is jointly trained with the PPG2speech synthesizer end-to-end. We conduct objective and subjective experiments on the CSTR VCTK Corpus under standard and one-shot VC conditions.

To prevent the model from overfitting, this paper proposes a novel speaker adaptation framework that decomposes the parameter space of the end-to-end acoustic model into two parts, with the one on predicting spoken content and the other on modeling speaker's voice. The spoken content is represented by phone posteriorgram (PPG) which is speaker independent. By adapting the two sub-modules separately, the overfitting can be alleviated effectively. Moreover, we propose two different adaptation strategies based on whether the data has text annotation. In this way, speaker adaptation can also be performed without text annotations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to embed speaker information to feature vectors at frame level using an attention mechanism, and its application to one-shot voice conversion. A one-shot voice conversion system is a type of voice conversion system where only one utterance from a target speaker is available for conversion. In many one-shot voice conversion systems, a speaker encoder mechanism compresses an utterance of the target speaker into a fixed-size vector for propagating speaker information. However, the obtained representation has lost temporal information related to speaker identities and it could degrade conversion quality. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel way to embed speaker information using an attention mechanism. Instead of compressing into a fixed-size vector, our proposed speaker encoder outputs a sequence of speaker embedding vectors. The obtained sequence is selectively combined with input frames of a source speaker by an attention mechanism. Finally the obtained time varying speaker information is utilized for a decoder to generate the converted features. Objective evaluation showed that our method reduced the averaged mel-cepstrum distortion to 5.23 dB from 5.34 dB compared with the baseline system. The subjective preference test showed that our proposed system outperformed the baseline one",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data efficient voice cloning aims at synthesizing target speaker's voice with only a few enrollment samples at hand. To this end, speaker adaptation and speaker encoding are two typical methods based on base model trained from multiple speakers. The former uses a small set of target speaker data to transfer the multi-speaker model to target speaker's voice through direct model update, while in the latter, only a few seconds of target speaker's audio directly goes through an extra speaker encoding model along with the multi-speaker model to synthesize target speaker's voice without model update. Nevertheless, the two methods need clean target speaker data. However, the samples provided by user may inevitably contain acoustic noise in real applications. It's still challenging to generating target voice with noisy data. In this paper, we study the data efficient voice cloning problem from noisy samples under the sequence-to-sequence based TTS paradigm. Specifically, we introduce domain adversarial training (DAT) to speaker adaptation and speaker encoding, which aims to disentangle noise from speech-noise mixture. Experiments show that for both speaker adaptation and encoding, the proposed approaches can consistently synthesize clean speech from noisy speaker samples, apparently outperforming the method adopting state-of-the-art speech enhancement module",

    "title": "Gated Multi-Head Attention Pooling for Weakly Labelled Audio Tagging",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multiple instance learning (MIL) has recently been used for weakly labelled audio tagging, where the spectrogram of an audio signal is divided into segments to form instances in a bag, and then the low-dimensional features of these segments are pooled for tagging. The choice of a pooling scheme is the key to exploiting the weakly labelled data. However, the traditional pooling schemes are usually fixed and unable to distinguish the contributions, making it difficult to adapt to the characteristics of the sound events. In this paper, a novel pooling algorithm is proposed for MIL, named gated multi-head attention pooling (GMAP), which is able to attend to the information of events from different heads at different positions. Each head allows the model to learn information from different representation subspaces. Furthermore, in order to avoid the redundancy of multi-head information, a gating mechanism is used to fuse individual head features. The proposed GMAP increases the modeling power of the single-head attention with no computational overhead. Experiments are carried out on Audioset, which is a large-scale weakly labelled dataset, and show superior results to the non-adaptive pooling and the vanilla attention pooling schemes",

Recently, temporal attention mechanisms have been used in CNN to capture the useful information from the relevant time frames for audio classification, especially for weakly labelled data where the onset and offset times of the sound events are not applied. In these methods, however, the inherent spectral characteristics and variations are not explicitly exploited when obtaining the deep features. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel temporal-spectral attention mechanism for CNN to learn discriminative sound representations, which enhances the temporal and spectral features by capturing the importance of different time frames and frequency bands. Parallel branches are constructed to allow temporal attention and spectral attention to be applied respectively in order to mitigate interference from the segments without the presence of sound events.

By penalizing inconsistent predictions under different perturbations, mean teacher methods can exploit large-scale unlabeled data in a self-ensembling manner. In this paper, an effective perturbation based semi-supervised learning (SSL) method is proposed based on the mean teacher method. Specifically, a new independent component (IC) module is proposed to introduce perturbations for different convolutional layers, designed as a combination of batch normalization and dropblock operations. The proposed IC module can reduce correlation between neurons to improve performance. A global statistics pooling based attention module is further proposed to explicitly model inter-dependencies between the time-frequency domain and channels, using statistics information (e.g. mean, standard deviation, max) along different dimensions. This can provide an effective attention mechanism to adaptively re-calibrate the output feature map.

To efficiently train polyphonic sound, we take only one PR for each sound event from a bounding box regressor associated with the attention-LSTM. In the second stage, the original input image and the difference image between adjacent segments are separately pooled according to the coordinate of each PR predicted in the first stage. Then, two feature maps using CNNs are concatenated and processed further by LSTM. Finally, CTC-based n-best SED is conducted using the softmax output from the CNN-LSTM, where CTC has two tokens for each event so that the start and ending time frames are accurately detected. Experiments on SED using DCASE 2019 Task 3 show that the proposed two-stage model with multi-token CTC achieves an F1-score of 97.5%, while the first stage alone and the two-stage model with a conventional CTC yield F1-scores of 91.9% and 95.6%, respectively",

    "abstract": "An essential component of spoken language understanding (SLU) is slot filling: representing the meaning of a spoken utterance using semantic entity labels. In this paper, we develop end-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding systems that directly convert speech input to semantic entities and investigate if these E2E SLU models can be trained solely on semantic entity annotations without word-for-word transcripts. Training such models is very useful as they can drastically reduce the cost of data collection. We created two types of such speech-to-entities models, a CTC model and an attention-based encoder-decoder model, by adapting models trained originally for speech recognition. Given that our experiments involve speech input, these systems need to recognize both the entity label and words representing the entity value correctly. For our speech-to-entities experiments on the ATIS corpus, both the CTC and attention models showed impressive ability to skip non-entity words: there was little degradation when trained on just entities versus full transcripts. We also explored the scenario where the entities are in an order not necessarily related to spoken order in the utterance. With its ability to do re-ordering, the attention model did remarkably well, achieving only about 2% degradation in speech-to-bag-of-entities F1 score",

    "abstract": "Large end-to-end neural open-domain chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. However, research on building such chatbots has typically assumed that the user input is written in nature and it is not clear whether these chatbots would seamlessly integrate with automatic speech recognition (ASR) models to serve the speech modality. We aim to bring attention to this important question by empirically studying the effects of various types of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses in the dialog history on TransferTransfo, a state-of-the-art Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) based neural open-domain dialog system from the NeurIPS ConvAI2 challenge. We observe that TransferTransfo trained on written data is very sensitive to such hypotheses introduced to the dialog history during inference time. As a baseline mitigation strategy, we introduce synthetic ASR hypotheses to the dialog history during training and observe marginal improvements, demonstrating the need for further research into techniques to make end-to-end open-domain chatbots fully speech-robust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the effects of synthetic and actual ASR hypotheses on a state-of-the-art neural open-domain dialog system and we hope it promotes speech-robustness as an evaluation criterion in open-domain dialog",

However, these backbones were originally proposed for image classification, and therefore may not be naturally fit for speaker recognition. Due to the prohibitive complexity of manually exploring the design space, we propose the first neural architecture search approach for the speaker recognition tasks, named as AutoSpeech. Our algorithm first identifies the optimal operation combination in a neural cell and then derives a CNN model by stacking the neural cell for multiple times. The final speaker recognition model can be obtained by training the derived CNN model through the standard scheme. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conduct experiments on both speaker identification and speaker verification tasks using the VoxCeleb1 dataset. Results demonstrate that the derived CNN architectures from the proposed approach significantly outperform current speaker recognition systems based on VGG-M, ResNet-18, and ResNet-34 backbones, while enjoying lower model complexity",

Previous attentive pooling methods employ scalar attention weights for each frame-level vector, resulting in insufficient collection of discriminative information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a vector-based attentive pooling method, which adopts vectorial attention instead of scalar attention. The vectorial attention can extract fine-grained features for discriminating different speakers. Besides, the vector-based attentive pooling is extended in a multi-head way for better speaker embeddings from multiple aspects. The proposed pooling method is evaluated with the x-vector baseline system. Experiments are conducted on two public datasets, VoxCeleb and Speaker in the Wild (SITW). The results show that the vector-based attentive pooling method achieves superior performance compared with statistics pooling and three state-of-the-art attentive pooling methods, with the best equal error rate (EER) of 2.734 and 3.062 in SITW as well as the best EER of 2.466 in VoxCeleb",

These limitations motivate researchers for the design of more efficient deep models.

Inspired by the Transformer, we propose a tandem Self-Attention Encoding and Pooling (SAEP) mechanism to obtain a discriminative speaker embedding given non-fixed length speech utterances. SAEP is a stack of identical blocks solely relied on self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks to create vector representation of speakers. This approach encodes short-term speaker spectral features into speaker embeddings to be used in text-independent speaker verification. We have evaluated this approach on both VoxCeleb1 & 2 datasets. The proposed architecture is able to outperform the baseline x-vector, and shows competitive performance to some other benchmarks based on convolutions, with a significant reduction in model size. It employs 94%, 95%, and 73% less parameters compared to ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and x-vector, respectively.

As a standalone component, each input speech is pre-processed by AS-Net first. Furthermore, we incorporate the compression structure and the speaker quality loss to enhance the capacity of the AS-Net.

The model takes a pair of input utterances and generates an utterance-level embedding to represent speaker-specific characteristics in each utterance. The input utterances are expected to have highly similar embeddings if they are from the same speaker. The proposed attention model consists of a self-attention module and a mutual attention module, which jointly contributes to the generation of the utterance-level embedding. The self-attention weights are computed from the utterance itself while the mutual-attention weights are computed with the involvement of the other utterance in the input pairs. As a result, each utterance is represented by a self-attention weighted embedding and a mutual-attention weighted embedding. The similarity between the embeddings is measured by a cosine distance score and a binary classifier output score. The whole model, named Dual Attention Network, is trained end-to-end on Voxceleb database. The evaluation results on Voxceleb 1 test set show that the Dual Attention Network significantly outperforms the baseline systems. The best result yields an equal error rate of 1.6%",

A suite of carefully designed and optimized audio front-end (AFE) algorithms help mitigate these challenges and provide better quality audio signals to the downstream modules such as WW spotter. Since the WW model is trained with the AFE-processed audio data, its performance is sensitive to AFE variations, such as gain changes. In addition, when deploying to new devices, the WW performance is not guaranteed because the AFE is unknown to the WW model. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach to use a new feature called ΔLFBE to decouple the AFE gain variations from the WW model. We modified the neural network architectures to accommodate the delta computation, with the feature extraction module unchanged. We evaluate our WW models using data collected from real household settings and showed the models with the ΔLFBE is robust to AFE gain changes. Specifically, when AFE gain changes up to ±12dB, the baseline CNN model lost up to relative 19.0% in false alarm rate or 34.3% in false reject rate, while the model with ΔLFBE demonstrates no performance loss",

    "title": "Smart Tube: A Biofeedback System for Vocal Training and Therapy Through Tube Phonation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Tube phonation, or straw phonation, is a frequently used vocal training technique to improve the efficiency of the vocal mechanism by repeatedly producing a speech sound into a tube or straw. Use of the straw results in a semi-occluded vocal tract in order to maximize the interaction between the vocal fold vibration and the vocal tract. This method requires a voice trainer or therapist to raise the trainee or patient's awareness of the vibrations around his or her mouth, guiding him/her to maximize the vibrations, which results in efficient phonation. A major problem with this process is that the trainer cannot monitor the trainee/patient's vibratory state in a quantitative manner. This study proposes the use of Smart Tube, a straw with an attached acceleration sensor and LED strip that can measure vibrations and provide corresponding feedback through LED lights in real-time. The biofeedback system was implemented using a microcontroller board, Arduino Uno, to minimize cost. Possible system function enhancements include Bluetooth compatibility with personal computers and/or smartphones. Smart Tube can facilitate improved phonation for trainees/patients by providing quantitative visual feedback",

Textual structured data is one such kind which is extensively used in systems like chat bots and automatic speech recognition. Unfortunately, a majority of these textual data available is unstructured in the form of user reviews and feedback, social media posts etc. Automating the task of categorizing or clustering these data into meaningful domains will reduce the time and effort needed in building sophisticated human-interactive systems. In this paper, we present a web tool that builds a domain specific data based on a search phrase from a database of highly unstructured user utterances. We also show the usage of Elasticsearch database with custom indexes for full correlated text-search. This tool uses the open sourced Glove model combined with cosine similarity and performs a graph based search to provide semantically and syntactically meaningful corpora.

We have developed multilingual (ML) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems and decoded speech of the four Ethiopian languages. A multilingual acoustic model (AM) trained with speech data of 22 Globalphone languages but the target languages, achieved a Word Error Rate (WER) of 15.79%. Moreover, including training speech of one closely related language (in terms of phonetic overlap) in ML AM training resulted in a relative WER reduction of 51.41%. Although adaptation of ML systems did not give significant WER reduction over the monolingual ones, it enables us to rapidly adapt existing ML ASR systems to new languages. In sum, our experiments demonstrated that ASR systems can be developed rapidly with a pronunciation dictionary (PD) of low out of vocabulary (OOV) rate and a strong language model (LM)",

We jointly train an AWE model and an AGWE model, using phonetically transcribed data from multiple languages. The pre-trained models can then be used for unseen zero-resource languages, or fine-tuned on data from low-resource languages. We also investigate distinctive features, as an alternative to phone labels, to better share cross-lingual information. We test our models on word discrimination tasks for twelve languages. When trained on eleven languages and tested on the remaining unseen language, our model outperforms traditional unsupervised approaches like dynamic time warping. After fine-tuning the pre-trained models on one hour or even ten minutes of data from a new language, performance is typically much better than training on only the target-language data. We also find that phonetic supervision improves performance over character sequences, and that distinctive feature supervision is helpful in handling unseen phones in the target language",

    "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks are usually solved using lexicon-based hybrid systems or character-based acoustic models to automatically translate speech data into written text. While hybrid systems require a manually designed lexicon, end-to-end models can process character-based speech data. This resolves the need to define a lexicon for non-English languages for which a standard lexicon may be absent. Korean is relatively phonetic and has a unique writing system, and it is thus worth investigating useful modeling units for end-to-end Korean ASR. Our work is the first to compare the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), designed as a combination of connectionist temporal classification and attention-based encoder-decoder, on various lexicon-free Korean models. Experiments on the Zeroth-Korean dataset and medical records, which consist of Korean-only and Korean-English code-switching corpora respectively, show how DNNs based on syllables and sub-words significantly outperform Jamo-based models on Korean ASR tasks.

    "abstract": "Despite tremendous progress in speaker verification recently, replay spoofing attacks are still a major threat to these systems. Focusing on dataset-specific scenarios, anti-spoofing systems have achieved promising in-domain performance at the cost of poor generalization towards unseen out-of-domain datasets. This is treated as a domain mismatch problem with a domain adversarial training (DAT) framework, which has previously been applied to enhance generalization. However, since only one domain discriminator is adopted, DAT suffers from the false alignment of cross-domain spoofed and genuine pairs, thus failing to acquire a strong spoofing-discriminative capability. In this work, we propose the dual-adversarial domain adaptation (DADA) framework to enable fine-grained alignment of spoofed and genuine data separately by using two domain discriminators, which effectively alleviates the above problem and further improves spoofing detection performance. Experiments on the ASVspoof 2017 V.2 dataset and the physical access portion of BTAS 2016 dataset demonstrate that the proposed DADA framework significantly outperforms the baseline model and DAT framework in cross-domain evaluation scenarios. It is shown that the newly proposed DADA architecture is more robust and effective for generalized replay attack detection",

This experiment is conducted by analyzing the spectral and prosodic characteristics during voice imitation. Spectral features include mel-frequency cepstral features (MFCC) and modified group delay features (MODGDF). Prosodic features, computed by the Legendre polynomial approximation, are used as complementary information to the i-vector model. Proposed system evaluates the competence of artists in voice mimicking and ranks them according to the scores from a classifier based on mean opinion score (MOS). If the artist with the highest MOS is identified as rank-1 by the proposed system, a hit occurs. DNN-based classifier makes the decision based on the probability value on the nodes at the output layer. The performance is evaluated using top X-hit criteria on a mimicry dataset. Top-2 hit rate of 81.81% is obtained for fusion experiment. The experiments demonstrate the potential of i-vector framework and its fusion in competency evaluation of voice mimicking",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Modern text-to-speech (TTS) and voice conversion (VC) systems produce natural sounding speech that questions the security of automatic speaker verification (ASV). This makes detection of such synthetic speech very important to safeguard ASV systems from unauthorized access. Most of the existing spoofing countermeasures perform well when the nature of the attacks is made known to the system during training. However, their performance degrades in face of unseen nature of attacks. In comparison to the synthetic speech created by a wide range of TTS and VC methods, genuine speech has a more consistent distribution. We believe that the difference between the distribution of synthetic and genuine speech is an important discriminative feature between the two classes. In this regard, we propose a novel method referred to as feature genuinization that learns a transformer with convolutional neural network (CNN) using the characteristics of only genuine speech. We then use this genuinization transformer with a light CNN classifier. The ASVspoof 2019 logical access corpus is used to evaluate the proposed method. The studies show that the proposed feature genuinization based LCNN system outperforms other state-of-the-art spoofing countermeasures, depicting its effectiveness for detection of synthetic speech attacks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current approaches to Voice Presentation Attack (VPA) detection have largely focused on spoofing detection within a single database and/or attack type. However, for practical Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) systems to be adopted by industry, they must be able to generalise to detect diverse and previously unseen VPAs. Inspired by successful aspects of deep learning systems for image classification such as the introduction of residual mappings through shortcut connections, this paper proposes a novel Light-ResNet architecture that provides good generalisation across databases and attack types. The introduction of skip connections within residual modules enables the training of deeper spoofing classifiers that can leverage more useful discriminative information learned in the hidden layers, while still generalising well under mismatched conditions. Utilising the wide variety of databases available for VPA research, this paper also proposes a set of generalisation evaluations which a practical PAD system should be able to meet: generalising within a database, generalising across databases within attack type and generalising across all spoofing classes. Evaluations on the ASVspoof 2015, BTAS 2016 (replay) and ASVspoof 2017 V2.0 databases show that the proposed Light-ResNet architecture is able to generalise across these diverse tasks consistently, outperforming CQCC-GMM and Attentive Filtering Network (AFN) baselines",

In the scoring phase, the GMM accumulates the scores on all frames in a test speech independently, and does not consider the relationship between adjacent frames. We propose the 1-D Convolutional Neural Network whose input is the log-probabilities of the speech frames on the GMM components. The new model considers not only the score distribution of GMM components, but also the local relationship of frames. And the pooling is used to extract the speech global character. The Siamese CNN is also proposed, which is based on two GMMs trained on genuine and spoofed speech respectively.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In bioacoustics, passive acoustic monitoring of animals living in the wild, both on land and underwater, leads to large data archives characterized by a strong imbalance between recorded animal sounds and ambient noises. Bioacoustic datasets suffer extremely from such large noise-variety, caused by a multitude of external influences and changing environmental conditions over years. This leads to significant deficiencies/problems concerning the analysis and interpretation of animal vocalizations by biologists and machine-learning algorithms. To counteract such huge noise diversity, it is essential to develop a denoising procedure enabling automated, efficient, and robust data enhancement. However, a fundamental problem is the lack of clean/denoised ground-truth samples. The current work is the first presenting a fully-automated deep denoising approach for bioacoustics, not requiring any clean ground-truth, together with one of the largest data archives recorded on killer whales ( Orcinus Orca) — the Orchive. Therefore, an approach, originally developed for image restoration, known as Noise2Noise (N2N), was transferred to the field of bioacoustics, and extended by using automatic machine-generated binary masks as additional network attention mechanism. Besides a significant cross-domain signal enhancement, our previous results regarding supervised orca/noise segmentation and orca call type identification were outperformed by applying ORCA-CLEAN as additional data preprocessing/enhancement step",

We evaluated the performance of cGANs in three tasks: 1) speaker-dependent one-to-one mappings, 2) speaker-independent many-to-one mappings, and 3) speaker-independent many-to-many mappings. In the first task, cGANs outperformed a traditional deep neural network mapping in terms of average keyword recall accuracy and the number of speakers with improved intelligibility. In the second task, we significantly improved intelligibility of one of three speakers, without any source speaker training data.

Next in the adaptation stage, a novel RTSL strategy is adopted to learn adapted target models without using paired source-target data often required in conventional teacher student learning. The proposed framework is evaluated on the DCASE 2018 Task1b data set. Experimental results based on AlexNet-L deep classification models confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach for mismatch situations. NLE-alone adaptation compares favourably with the conventional device adaptation and teacher student based adaptation techniques. NLE with RTSL further improves the classification accuracy",

    "title": "An Acoustic Segment Model Based Segment Unit Selection Approach to Acoustic Scene Classification with Partial Utterances",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a sub-utterance unit selection framework to remove acoustic segments in audio recordings that carry little information for acoustic scene classification (ASC). Our approach is built upon a universal set of acoustic segment units covering the overall acoustic scene space. First, those units are modeled with acoustic segment models (ASMs) used to tokenize acoustic scene utterances into sequences of acoustic segment units. Next, paralleling the idea of stop words in information retrieval, stop ASMs are automatically detected. Finally, acoustic segments associated with the stop ASMs are blocked, because of their low indexing power in retrieval of most acoustic scenes. In contrast to building scene models with whole utterances, the ASM-removed sub-utterances, i.e., acoustic utterances without stop acoustic segments, are then used as inputs to the AlexNet-L back-end for final classification. On the DCASE 2018 dataset, scene classification accuracy increases from 68%, with whole utterances, to 72.1%, with segment selection. This represents a competitive accuracy without any data augmentation, and/or ensemble strategy. Moreover, our approach compares favourably to AlexNet-L with attention",

Many times, either the background (or the foreground) may provide useful cues in discriminating one soundscape from another. A part of the background or a part of the foreground can be suppressed by using subspace projections. These projections can be learnt by utilising the framework of robust principal component analysis. In this work, audio signals are represented as embeddings from a convolutional neural network, and meta-embeddings are derived using an attention mechanism. This representation enables the use of class-specific projections for effective suppression, leading to good discrimination.

These two classes of models have significantly affected the field of text-to-speech, but have never been thoroughly applied to the task of singing synthesis. UTACO demonstrates that attention can be successfully applied to the singing synthesis field and improves naturalness over the state of the art. The system requires considerably less explicit modelling of voice features such as F0 patterns, vibratos, and note and phoneme durations, than previous models in the literature. Despite this, it shows a strong improvement in naturalness with respect to previous neural singing synthesis models. The model does not require any durations or pitch patterns as inputs, and learns to insert vibrato autonomously according to the musical context. However, we observe that, by completely dispensing with any explicit duration modelling it becomes harder to obtain the fine control of timing needed to exactly match the tempo of a song",

    "abstract": "Peking Opera has been the most dominant form of Chinese performing art since around 200 years ago. A Peking Opera singer usually exhibits a very strong personal style via introducing improvisation and expressiveness on stage which leads the actual rhythm and pitch contour to deviate significantly from the original music score. This inconsistency poses a great challenge in Peking Opera singing voice synthesis from a music score. In this work, we propose to deal with this issue and synthesize expressive Peking Opera singing from the music score based on the Duration Informed Attention Network (DurIAN) framework. To tackle the rhythm mismatch, Lagrange multiplier is used to find the optimal output phoneme duration sequence with the constraint of the given note duration from music score. As for the pitch contour mismatch, instead of directly inferring from music score, we adopt a pseudo music score generated from the real singing and feed it as input during training. The experiments demonstrate that with the proposed system we can synthesize Peking Opera singing voice with high-quality timbre, pitch and expressiveness",

In this paper, we introduce a singing voice conversion algorithm that is capable of generating high quality target speaker's singing using only his/her normal speech data. First, we manage to integrate the training and conversion process of speech and singing into one framework by unifying the features used in standard speech synthesis system and singing synthesis system. In this way, normal speech data can also contribute to singing voice conversion training, making the singing voice conversion system more robust especially when the singing database is small. Moreover, in order to achieve one-shot singing voice conversion, a speaker embedding module is developed using both speech and singing data, which provides target speaker identify information during conversion.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Detecting singing-voice in polyphonic instrumental music is critical to music information retrieval. To train a robust vocal detector, a large dataset marked with vocal or non-vocal label at frame-level is essential. However, frame-level labeling is time-consuming and labor expensive, resulting there is little well-labeled dataset available for singing-voice detection (S-VD). Hence, we propose a data augmentation method for S-VD by transfer learning. In this study, clean speech clips with voice activity endpoints and separate instrumental music clips are artificially added together to simulate polyphonic vocals to train a vocal /non-vocal detector. Due to the different articulation and phonation between speaking and singing, the vocal detector trained with the artificial dataset does not match well with the polyphonic music which is singing vocals together with the instrumental accompaniments. To reduce this mismatch, transfer learning is used to transfer the knowledge learned from the artificial speech-plus-music training set to a small but matched polyphonic dataset, i.e., singing vocals with accompaniments. By transferring the related knowledge to make up for the lack of well-labeled training data in S-VD, the proposed data augmentation method by transfer learning can improve S-VD performance with an F-score improvement from 89.5% to 93.2%",

Specifically, in this paper, we decompose the input mixture spectra into several bands and concatenate them channel-wise as the model input. The proposed approach enables effective weight sharing in each subband and introduces more flexibility between channels. For comparison purposes, we perform voice and accompaniment separation (VAS) on models with different scales, architectures, and CWS settings. Experiments show that the CWS input is beneficial in many aspects. We evaluate our method on musdb18hq test set, focusing on SDR, SIR and SAR metrics. Among all our experiments, CWS enables models to obtain 6.9% performance gain on the average metrics. With even a smaller number of parameters, less training data, and shorter training time, ourMDenseNet with 8-bands CWS input still surpasses the original MMDenseNet with a large margin.

Specifically, we propose to embed speaker knowledge through a persistent memory model into speech transformer encoder at utterance level. The speaker information is represented by a number of static speaker i-vectors, which is concatenated to speech utterance at each encoder self-attention layer. Persistent memory is thus formed by carrying speaker information through the depth of encoder. The speaker knowledge is captured from self-attention between speech and persistent memory vector in encoder.

    "abstract": "This paper presents XiaoiceSing, a high-quality singing voice synthesis system which employs an integrated network for spectrum, F0 and duration modeling. We follow the main architecture of FastSpeech while proposing some singing-specific design: 1) Besides phoneme ID and position encoding, features from musical score (e.g. note pitch and length) are also added. 2) To attenuate off-key issues, we add a residual connection in F0 prediction. 3) In addition to the duration loss of each phoneme, the duration of all the phonemes in a musical note is accumulated to calculate the syllable duration loss for rhythm enhancement. Experiment results show that XiaoiceSing outperforms the baseline system of convolutional neural networks by 1.44 MOS on sound quality, 1.18 on pronunciation accuracy and 1.38 on naturalness respectively. In two A/B tests, the proposed F0 and duration modeling methods achieve 97.3% and 84.3% preference rate over baseline respectively, which demonstrates the overwhelming advantages of XiaoiceSing",

There have been a number of works that have solved for this ability recently. We differ from these approaches by enabling a variety of talking face generations based on single audio input. Indeed, just having the ability to generate a single talking face would make a system almost robotic in nature. In contrast, our unsupervised stochastic audio-to-video generation model allows for diverse generations from a single audio input. Particularly, we present an unsupervised stochastic audio-to-video generation model that can capture multiple modes of the video distribution. We ensure that all the diverse generations are plausible. We do so through a principled multi-modal variational autoencoder framework. We demonstrate its efficacy on the challenging LRWand GRID datasets and demonstrate performance better than the baseline, while having the ability to generate multiple diverse lip synchronized videos",

Specifically, given a speech input, and the F0 contour of the target singing output, the proposed model generates the spectrogram of a singing signal with a progressive-growing encoder/decoder architecture. Moreover, the model uses a boundary equilibrium GAN loss term such that it can learn from both paired and unpaired data. The spectrogram is finally converted into wave with a separate GAN-based vocoder.

The speech encoder outputs an embedding vector which is distinguishable from other speakers. The multi-speaker TTS synthesizes speech by using the embedding vector, and then the face encoder outputs the embedding vector of a speaker from the speaker's face image.

In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method is proposed to generate talking head video with not only high quality facial appearance, accurate lip movement, but also natural head motion. To this aim, the facial landmarks are detected and used to represent lip motion and head pose, and the conversions from speech to these middle level representations are learned separately through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with wingloss. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is adopted to regularize the sequential transition. The representations for different factors of talking head are jointly feeded to a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model with an attentional mechanism to synthesize the talking video.

The challenge organizers called for submissions of speech signals processed with the aim to improve their intelligibility in adverse listening conditions. They evaluated the submissions with matrix sentence tests in an international listening experiment. An intelligibility-improving signal processing approach (IISPA) inspired from research on speech perception of listeners with impaired hearing was designed. Its parameters were optimized with an objective intelligibility model, the simulation framework for auditory discrimination experiments (FADE). In FADE, a re-purposed automatic speech recognition (ASR) system is employed as a models for human speech recognition performance. The model predicted an improvement in speech recognition threshold (SRT) of approximately 5.0 dB due to the optimized IISPA. The processed speech signals were evaluated in the Hurricane Challenge 2.0. The measured improvements were language-dependent: up to 4.8 dB for the Spanish test, up to 3.8 dB for the German test, and up to 2.1 dB for the English test.

    "abstract": "Fast speech may reduce intelligibility, but there is little agreement as to whether listeners benefit from slower speech in noisy conditions. The current study explored the relationship between speech rate and masker properties using a listening preference technique in which participants were able to control speech rate in real time. Spanish listeners adjusted speech rate while listening to word sequences in quiet, in stationary noise at signal-to-noise ratios of 0, +6 and +12 dB, and in modulated noise for 5 envelope modulation rates. Following selection of a preferred rate, participants went on to identify words presented at that rate. Listeners favoured faster speech in quiet, chose increasingly slower rates in increasing levels of stationary noise, and showed a preference for speech rates that led to a contrast with masker envelope modulation rates. Participants showed distinct preferences even when intelligibility was near ceiling levels. These outcomes suggest that individuals attempt to compensate for the decrement in cognitive resources availability in more adverse conditions by reducing speech rate and are able to exploit differences in modulation properties of the target speech and masker. The listening preference approach provides insights into factors such as listening effort that are not measured in intelligibility-based metrics",

Often NELE algorithms are designed for scenarios considering either only the detrimental effect of noise or only reverberation, but not both disturbances. In many typical applications scenarios, however, both factors are present. In this paper, we evaluate a new combination of a noise-dependent and a reverberation-dependent algorithm implemented in a common framework. Specifically, we use instrumental measures as well as subjective ratings of listening effort for acoustic scenarios with different reverberation times and realistic signal-to-noise ratios. The results show that the noise-dependent algorithm also performs well in reverberation, and that the combination of both algorithms can yield slightly better performance than the individual algorithms alone. This benefit appears to depend strongly on the specific acoustic condition, indicating that further work is required to optimize the adaptive algorithm behavior",

It is hence desirable to build a system capable of generating highly intelligible speech in the presence of noise. Past studies have investigated style conversion in TTS synthesis, yet degraded synthesized quality often leads to worse intelligibility. To overcome such limitations, we proposed a novel transfer learning approach using Tacotron and WaveRNN based TTS synthesis. The proposed speech system exploits two modification strategies: (a) Lombard speaking style data and (b) Spectral Shaping and Dynamic Range Compression (SSDRC) which has been shown to provide high intelligibility gains by redistributing the signal energy on the time-frequency domain. We refer to this extension as Lombard-SSDRC TTS system. Intelligibility enhancement as quantified by the Intelligibility in Bits (SIIB ) measure shows that the proposed Lombard-SSDRC TTS system shows significant relative improvement between 110% and 130% in speech-shaped noise (SSN), and 47% to 140% in competing-speaker noise (CSN) against the state-of-the-art TTS approach. Additional subjective evaluation shows that Lombard-SSDRC TTS successfully increases the speech intelligibility with relative improvement of 455% for SSN and 104% for CSN in median keyword correction rate compared to the baseline TTS method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In 2017 and 2018, two types of vocal-tract models with physical materials were developed that resemble anatomical models and can physically produce human-like speech sounds. The 2017 model is a static-model, and its vocal-tract configuration is set to produce the vowel /a/. The 2018 model is a dynamic-model, and portions of the articulators including the top surface of the tongue are made of a gel-type material. This allows a user to manipulate the shape of the tongue and articulate different vowels and a certain set of consonants. However, the mandible of the model is fixed, making it difficult to manipulate different sounds with different jaw openings, such as high vs. low vowels. Therefore, in 2019, two types were developed by adding an additional mandible mechanism to the 2018 model. For the first type, the mandible was designed to move between the open and closed positions by creating an arc-shape rail. For the second type, the mandible moves the same trajectory with an additional support. As a result, various speech sounds with a flexible-tongue and moveable mandible can be easily produced. These models are more realistic than the anatomical models proposed in 2017 and 2018 in terms of articulatory movements",

One of the underlying assumptions is that the samples of all the articulatory channels used for training are balanced and play the same role in AAI. However, this is not true from speech production point view. In this study, at each time instant, each articulatory channel is classified to be critical or noncritical according to their roles in the formation of constrictions along the vocal tract when producing speech sound. It is found that the training set is dominated by the samples of noncritical articulatory channels. To deal with the unbalanced dataset problem, several Bi-LSTM networks are trained by removing the of noncritical portions of each articulatory channels if the training errors are less than some dynamic threshold. The results indicate that the average RMSE over all the articulatory channels, the average RMSE over the critical articulators, and the average RMSE over the noncritical articulators can be reduced significantly by the proposed method",

The lower vocal tract has been suggested to be such a causal region, but a question remains as to how this region modulates vowels' higher spectra. Based on existing data, this study predicts that resonance of the lower vocal tract modulates higher vowel spectra into a peak-dip-peak pattern. A preliminary acoustic simulation was made to confirm that complexity of lower vocal-tract cavities generates such a pattern with the second peak. This spectral modulation pattern was further examined to see to what extent it contributes to generating static speaker characteristics. To do so, a statistical analysis of male and female F-ratio curves was conducted based on a speech database. In the result, three frequency regions for the peak-dip-peak patterns correspond to three regions in the gender-specific F-ratio curves. Thus, this study suggests that, while the first peak may be the major determinant by the human ears, the whole frequency pattern facilitates speaker recognition by machines",

Air-tissue boundaries (ATBs) are the contours that trace the transition between high-intensity tissue region and low-intensity airway cavity region in an rtMRI video. The ATBs are used in several speech related applications. However, the ATB segmentation is a challenging task as the rtMRI frames have low resolution and low signal-to-noise ratio. Several works have been proposed in the past for ATB segmentation. Among these, the supervised algorithms have been shown to perform well compared to the unsupervised algorithms. However, the supervised algorithms have limited generalizability towards subjects not involved in training. In this work, we propose a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) which utilizes both spatial and temporal information from the rtMRI video for accurate ATB segmentation. The 3D-CNN model captures the vocal tract dynamics in an rtMRI video independent of the morphology of the subject leading to an accurate ATB segmentation for unseen subjects. In a leave-one-subject-out experimental setup, it is observed that the proposed approach provides ~32% relative improvement in the performance compared to the best (SegNet based) baseline approach",

We recently proposed a time-domain solution, SpEx, that avoids the phase estimation in frequency-domain approaches. Unfortunately, SpEx is not fully a time-domain solution since it performs time-domain speech encoding for speaker extraction, while taking frequency-domain speaker embedding as the reference. The size of the analysis window for time-domain and the size for frequency-domain input are also different. Such mismatch has an adverse effect on the system performance. To eliminate such mismatch, we propose a complete time-domain speaker extraction solution, that is called SpEx+. Specifically, we tie the weights of two identical speech encoder networks, one for the encoder-extractor-decoder pipeline, another as part of the speaker encoder. Experiments show that the SpEx+ achieves 0.8dB and 2.1dB SDR improvement over the state-of-the-art SpEx baseline, under different and same gender conditions on WSJ0-2mix-extr database respectively",

    "abstract": "Target speech separation refers to isolating target speech from a multi-speaker mixture signal by conditioning on auxiliary information about the target speaker. Different from the mainstream audio-visual approaches which usually require simultaneous visual streams as additional input, e.g. the corresponding lip movement sequences, in our approach we propose the novel use of a single face profile of the target speaker to separate expected clean speech. We exploit the fact that the image of a face contains information about the person's speech sound. Compared to using a simultaneous visual sequence, a face image is easier to obtain by pre-enrollment or on websites, which enables the system to generalize to devices without cameras. To this end, we incorporate face embeddings extracted from a pre-trained model for face recognition into the speech separation, which guide the system in predicting a target speaker mask in the time-frequency domain. The experimental results show that a pre-enrolled face image is able to benefit separating expected speech signals. Additionally, face information is complementary to voice reference and we show that further improvement can be achieved when combining both face and voice embeddings ",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Extracting the speech of a target speaker from mixed audios, based on a reference speech from the target speaker, is a challenging yet powerful technology in speech processing. Recent studies of speaker-independent speech separation, such as TasNet, have shown promising results by applying deep neural networks over the time-domain waveform. Such separation neural network does not directly generate reliable and accurate output when target speakers are specified, because of the necessary prior on the number of speakers and the lack of robustness when dealing with audios with absent speakers. In this paper, we break these limitations by introducing a new speaker-aware speech masking method, called X-TaSNet. Our proposal adopts new strategies, including a distortion-based loss and corresponding alternating training scheme, to better address the robustness issue. X-TaSNet significantly enhances the extracted speech quality, doubling SDRi and SI-SNRi of the output speech audio over state-of-the-art voice filtering approach. X-TaSNet also improves the reliability of the results by improving the accuracy of speaker identity in the output audio to 95.4%, such that it returns silent audios in most cases when the target speaker is absent. These results demonstrate X-TaSNet moves one solid step towards more practical applications of speaker extraction technology",

Compared to the previous methods applying pure audio modal or audio-visual modals, a specific model is further designed to extract contextual language information for all target speakers directly from the speech mixture.

    "abstract": "Speech recognition technology in single-talker scenes has matured in recent years. However, in noisy environments, especially in multi-talker scenes, speech recognition performance is significantly reduced. Towards cocktail party problem, we propose a unified time-domain target speaker extraction framework. In this framework, we obtain a voiceprint from a clean speech of the target speaker and then extract the speech of the same speaker in a mixed speech based on the previously obtained voiceprint. This framework uses voiceprint information to avoid permutation problems. In addition, a time-domain model can avoid the phase reconstruction problem of traditional time-frequency domain models. Our framework is suitable for scenes where people are relatively fixed and their voiceprints are easily registered, such as in a car, home, meeting room, or other such scenes. The proposed global model based on the dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN) block achieved state-of-the-art under speaker extraction tasks on the WSJ0-2mix dataset. We also built corresponding low-latency models. Results showed comparable model performance and a much shorter upper limit latency than time-frequency domain models.

    "abstract": "Target-speaker speech separation, due to its essence in industrial applications, has been heavily researched for long by many. The key metric for qualifying a good separation algorithm still lies on the separation performance, i.e., the quality of the separated voice. In this paper, we presented a novel high-performance time-domain waveform based target-speaker speech separation architecture (WaveFilter) for this task. Unlike most previous researches which adopted Time-Frequency based approaches, WaveFilter does the job by applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based feature extractors directly on the raw Time-domain audio data, for both the speech separation network and the auxiliary target-speaker feature extraction network. We achieved a 10.46 Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement on the WSJ0 2-mix dataset and a 10.44 SNR improvement on the Librispeech dataset as our final results, which is much higher than the existing approaches. Our method also achieved an 4.9 SNR improvement on the WSJ0 3-mix data.

This paper addresses the AE sound selection (or removal) problems, that we define as the extraction (or suppression) of all the sounds that belong to one or multiple desired AE classes. Although this problem could be addressed with a combination of source separation followed by AE classification, this is a sub-optimal way of solving the problem. Moreover, source separation usually requires knowing the maximum number of sources, which may not be practical when dealing with AEs. In this paper, we propose instead a universal sound selection neural network that enables to directly select AE sounds from a mixture given user-specified target AE classes. The proposed framework can be explicitly optimized to simultaneously select sounds from multiple desired AE classes, independently of the number of sources in the mixture.

Unfortunately, in real-world media data, since co-occurrences in various aspects are complexly mixed, it is difficult to distinguish a specific target co-occurrence from many other non-target co-occurrences, resulting in failure in crossmodal retrieval. To overcome this problem, we propose a triplet-loss-based representation learning method that incorporates an awareness mechanism. We adopt weakly-supervised event detection, which provides a constraint in representation learning so that our method can \"be aware\" of a specific target audio-visual co-occurrence and discriminate it from other non-target co-occurrences. We evaluated the performance of our method by applying it to a sound effect retrieval task using recorded TV broadcast data. In the task, a sound effect appropriate for a given video input should be retrieved. We then conducted objective and subjective evaluations, the results indicating that the proposed method produces significantly better associations of sound and visual effects than baselines with no awareness mechanism",

Since VAD segmentation is not syntax-informed, the resulting segments do not necessarily correspond to well-formed sentences uttered by the speaker but, most likely, to fragments of one or more sentences. This segmentation mismatch degrades considerably the quality of ST models' output. So far, researchers have focused on improving audio segmentation towards producing sentence-like splits. In this paper, instead, we address the issue in the model, making it more robust to a different, potentially sub-optimal segmentation. To this aim, we train our models on randomly segmented data and compare two approaches: fine-tuning and adding the previous segment as context.

Specifically, we examine two approaches for calculating similarities: one using image embedding vectors and the other using object recognition results.

Before compensation, shouted condition is automatically detected by means of logistic regression. The process is computationally light and it is performed in the back-end of an x-vector system. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach in the presence of vocal effort mismatch yields up to 13.8% equal error rate relative improvement with respect to a system that applies neither shouted speech detection nor compensation",

    "abstract": "We introduce sum-product networks (SPNs) for robust speech processing through a simple robust automatic speaker identification (ASI) task SPNs are deep probabilistic graphical models capable of answering multiple probabilistic queries. We show that SPNs are able to remain robust by using the marginal probability density function (PDF) of the spectral features that reliably represent speech. Though current SPN toolkits and learning algorithms are in their infancy, we aim to show that SPNs have the potential to become a useful tool for robust speech processing in the future. SPN speaker models are evaluated here on real-world non-stationary and coloured noise sources at multiple signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. In terms of ASI accuracy, we find that SPN speaker models are more robust than two recent convolutional neural network (CNN)-based ASI systems. Additionally, SPN speaker models consist of significantly fewer parameters than their CNN-based counterparts. The results indicate that SPN speaker models could be a robust, parameter-efficient alternative for ASI. Additionally, this work demonstrates that SPNs have potential in related tasks, such as robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) and automatic speaker verification (ASV)",

    "abstract": "Most studies on speaker verification systems focus on long-duration utterances, which are composed of sufficient phonetic information. However, the performances of these systems are known to degrade when short-duration utterances are inputted due to the lack of phonetic information as compared to the long utterances. In this paper, we propose a method that compensates for the performance degradation of speaker verification for short utterances, referred to as \" segment aggregation\". The proposed method adopts an ensemble-based design to improve the stability and accuracy of speaker verification systems. The proposed method segments an input utterance into several short utterances and then aggregates the segment embeddings extracted from the segmented inputs to compose a speaker embedding. Then, this method simultaneously trains the segment embeddings and the aggregated speaker embedding. In addition, we also modified the teacher-student learning method for the proposed method. Experimental results on different input duration using the VoxCeleb1 test set demonstrate that the proposed technique improves speaker verification performance by about 45.37% relatively compared to the baseline system with 1-second test utterance condition",

    "abstract": "Recently adversarial attacks on automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems attracted widespread attention as they pose severe threats to ASV systems. However, methods to defend against such attacks are limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on retraining ASV systems with adversarial data augmentation. Also, countermeasure robustness against different attack settings are insufficiently investigated. Orthogonal to prior approaches, this work proposes to defend ASV systems against adversarial attacks with a separate detection network, rather than augmenting adversarial data into ASV training. A VGG-like binary classification detector is introduced and demonstrated to be effective on detecting adversarial samples. To investigate detector robustness in a realistic defense scenario where unseen attack settings may exist, we analyze various kinds of unseen attack settings' impact and observe that the detector is robust (6.27% EER degradation in the worst case) against unseen substitute ASV systems, but it has weak robustness (50.37% EER degradation in the worst case) against unseen perturbation methods. The weak robustness against unseen perturbation methods shows a direction for developing stronger countermeasures",

However, the increased complexity of a model can also introduce high risk of over-fitting, which is a major challenge in SLU tasks due to the limitation of available data. In this paper, we propose an attention-based SLU model together with three encoder enhancement strategies to overcome data sparsity challenge. The first strategy focuses on the transfer-learning approach to improve feature extraction capability of the encoder. It is implemented by pre-training the encoder component with a quantity of Automatic Speech Recognition annotated data relying on the standard Transformer architecture and then fine-tuning the SLU model with a small amount of target labelled data. The second strategy adopts multi-task learning strategy, the SLU model integrates the speech recognition model by sharing the same underlying encoder, such that improving robustness and generalization ability. The third strategy, learning from Component Fusion (CF) idea, involves a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer (BERT) model and aims to boost the capability of the decoder with an auxiliary network. It hence reduces the risk of over-fitting and augments the ability of the underlying encoder, indirectly.

In particular, we discuss the application of existing data balancing techniques for SLU and propose a multi-task SLU model for intent classification and slot filling. Aiming to avoid over-fitting, in our model methods for data balancing are leveraged indirectly via an auxiliary task which makes use of a class-balanced batch generator and (possibly) synthetic data. Our results on a real-world dataset indicate that i) our proposed model can boost performance on low frequency intents significantly while avoiding a potential performance decrease on the head intents, ii) synthetic data are beneficial for bootstrapping new intents when realistic data are not available, but iii) once a certain amount of realistic data becomes available, using synthetic data in the auxiliary task only yields better performance than adding them to the primary task training data, and iv) in a joint training scenario, balancing the intent distribution individually improves not only intent classification but also slot filling performance",

    "abstract": "Neural models have yielded state-of-the-art results in deciphering spoken language understanding (SLU) problems; however, these models require a significant amount of domain-specific labeled examples for training, which is prohibitively expensive. While pre-trained language models like BERT have been shown to capture a massive amount of knowledge by learning from unlabeled corpora and solve SLU using fewer labeled examples for adaption, the encoding of knowledge is implicit and agnostic to downstream tasks. Such encoding results in model inefficiencies in parameter usage: an entirely new model is required for every domain. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel SLU framework, comprising a conversational language modeling (CLM) pre-training task and a light encoder architecture. The CLM pre-training enables networks to capture the representation of the language in conversation style with the presence of ASR errors. The light encoder architecture separates the shared pre-trained networks from the mappings of generally encoded knowledge to specific domains of SLU, allowing for the domain adaptation to be performed solely at the light encoder and thus increasing efficiency. With the framework, we match the performance of state-of-the-art SLU results on Alexa internal datasets and on two public ones (ATIS, SNIPS), adding only 4.4% parameters per task",

Dialogue sequence labeling is a supervised learning task that estimates labels for each utterance in the given dialogue document, and is useful for many applications such as topic segmentation and dialogue act estimation. Accurate labeling often requires a large amount of labeled training data, but it is difficult to collect such data every time we need to support a new domain, such as contact centers in a new business field. In order to solve this difficulty, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for dialogue sequence labeling. Our key idea is to construct dialogue sequence labeling using labeled source domain data and unlabeled target domain data so as to remove domain dependencies at utterance-level and dialogue-level contexts. The proposed method adopts hierarchical adversarial training; two domain adversarial networks, an utterance-level context independent network and a dialogue-level context dependent network, are introduced for improving domain invariance in the dialogue sequence labeling.

Here, we analyze naive listeners' capacities for whistled consonant categorization for four consonants: /p/, /k/, /t/ and /s/ by presenting the findings of two behavioral experiments. Though both experiments measure whistled consonant categorization, we used modified frequencies — lowered with a phase vocoder — of the whistled stimuli in the second experiment to better identify the relative nature of pitch cues employed in this process. Results show that participants obtained approximately 50% of correct responses (when chance is at 25%). These findings show specific consonant preferences for \"s\" and \"t\" over \"k\" and \"p\", specifically when stimuli is unmodified.

To test which properties of the F0 affect the perceived segmentation, we manipulated the F0 slope and/or the mean value of the first vowel /a/ in consonant-initial items (e.g., la mie). To assess differences in off-line vs online processing, we used a two-alternative, forced-choice task in Experiment 1 and a lexical decision task in Experiment 2. A previous study showed that vowel-initial segmentation was enhanced when the F0 mean value increased. However, the present study shows that modifying the F0 slope while keeping the F0 mean value constant also influences speech segmentation in both off-line and online tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In two long-term repetition priming experiments, we investigated how accentual information is processed and represented in the French listeners' mind. Repeated prime and target words either matched (/bãˈdo/ - / bãˈdo/ ‘headband') or mismatched in their accentual patterns (/bãdo/ - /bãˈdo/). In experiment 1, the target words were presented in the left ear only, and attenuation in the repetition priming effect was observed when the primes and the targets mismatched in their accentual pattern. The differential priming effect between match and mismatch primes was no longer observed in Experiment 2 when the targets were presented in the right ear only. Together, these results showed that accentual variation at the word level in French is treated as related-talker variation, and only influences word recognition under specific circumstances, in particular, when we push word processing in the right hemisphere",

In this study, a perceptual experiment of the five level tones in Hmu (Xinzhai variety) was conducted to further examine this conclusion. Results show that in the identification test, continua between different level tones have different boundary width, which has a negative correlation with the pitch interval of two level tones. In the discrimination test, though there is no peak in discrimination curve, the discrimination accuracy reveals an important phenomenon that the accuracy is approximately 50% between two neighboring level tones, but higher when the level tones have a larger pitch interval. Besides, the boundary width is highly correlated with the discrimination accuracy (e.g., the narrower the boundary width, the higher the discrimination accuracy). These results reveal the basic characteristic of continuous perception, especially for level tones. Finally, the results also demonstrate that the category in categorical perception is not equal to phonological category",

    "abstract": "Listeners segment speech based on the rhythm of their native language(s) (e.g., stress- vs. syllable-timed, tone vs. non-tone) [1,2]. In English, the perception of speech rhythm relies on analyzing auditory cues pertinent to lexical stress, including pitch, duration and intensity [3]. Focusing on cross-linguistic impact on English lexical stress cue processing, the present study aims to explore English stress cue-weighting by Mandarin-speaking adults (with English adults as control), using an MMN multi-feature paradigm Preliminary ERP data revealed cross-linguistic perceptual differences to pitch and duration cues, but not to intensity cues in the bisyllabic non-word /dede/. Specifically, while English adults were similarly sensitive to pitch change at the initial and final syllable of the non-word, they were more sensitive to the duration change at the initial syllable. Comparatively, Mandarin adults were similarly sensitive to duration change at each position, but more sensitive to pitch at the final syllable. Lastly, both the Mandarin group and the English group were more sensitive to the intensity sound change at the second syllable. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed",

Finally, participants repeated the carrier phrase. Degree of phonetic alignment was assessed acoustically between the target word in the model's response and participants' response.

In particular, we demonstrate it carries information related to the temporal structure of the signal as well as the speech's source component. Furthermore, we investigate the usefulness of combining it with the raw magnitude spectrum via multi-head CNNs at different fusion levels for ASR. While information-wise these two streams of information are together equivalent to the raw waveform signal the overall performance is noticeably higher than raw waveform and classic features such as MFCC and filterbank.

    "abstract": "Speech recognition in noisy and channel distorted scenarios is often challenging as the current acoustic modeling schemes are not adaptive to the changes in the signal distribution in the presence of noise. In this work, we develop a novel acoustic modeling framework for noise robust speech recognition based on relevance weighting mechanism. The relevance weighting is achieved using a sub-network approach that performs feature selection. A relevance sub-network is applied on the output of first layer of a convolutional network model operating on raw speech signals while a second relevance sub-network is applied on the second convolutional layer output. The relevance weights for the first layer correspond to an acoustic filterbank selection while the relevance weights in the second layer perform modulation filter selection. The model is trained for a speech recognition task on noisy and reverberant speech. The speech recognition experiments on multiple datasets (Aurora-4, CHiME-3, VOiCES) reveal that the incorporation of relevance weighting in the neural network architecture improves the speech recognition word error rates significantly (average relative improvements of 10% over the baseline systems)",

    "title": "A Deep 2D Convolutional Network for Waveform-Based Speech Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Due to limited computational resources, acoustic models of early automatic speech recognition ( asr) systems were built in low-dimensional feature spaces that incur considerable information loss at the outset of the process. Several comparative studies of automatic and human speech recognition suggest that this information loss can adversely affect the robustness of asr systems. To mitigate that and allow for learning of robust models, we propose a deep 2 d convolutional network in the waveform domain. The first layer of the network decomposes waveforms into frequency sub-bands, thereby representing them in a structured high-dimensional space. This is achieved by means of a parametric convolutional block defined via cosine modulations of compactly supported windows. The next layer embeds the waveform in an even higher-dimensional space of high-resolution spectro-temporal patterns, implemented via a 2 d convolutional block. This is followed by a gradual compression phase that selects most relevant spectro-temporal patterns using wide-pass 2 d filtering. Our results show that the approach significantly outperforms alternative waveform-based models on both noisy and spontaneous conversational speech (24% and 11% relative error reduction, respectively). Moreover, this study provides empirical evidence that learning directly from the waveform domain could be more effective than learning using hand-crafted features",

It generates features of different orders, with the first order coefficients approximately equal to the Mel-frequency cepstrum, and higher order coefficients recovering information lost at lower levels. We investigate the effect of including the information recovered by higher order coefficients on the robustness of speech recognition. To that end, we also propose a modification to the original scattering transform tailored for noisy speech. In particular, instead of the modulus non-linearity we opt to work with power coefficients and, therefore, use the squared modulus non-linearity. We quantify the robustness of scattering features using the word error rates of acoustic models trained on clean speech and evaluated using sets of utterances corrupted with different noise types. Our empirical results show that the second order scattering power spectrum coefficients capture invariants relevant for noise robustness and that this additional information improves generalization to unseen noise conditions (almost 20% relative error reduction on aurora 4).

    "abstract": "Conversion of Chinese graphemes to phonemes (G2P) is an essential component in Mandarin Chinese Text-To-Speech (TTS) systems. One of the biggest challenges in Chinese G2P conversion is how to disambiguate the pronunciation of polyphones — characters having multiple pronunciations. Although many academic efforts have been made to address it, there has been no open dataset that can serve as a standard benchmark for a fair comparison to date. In addition, most of the reported systems are hard to employ for researchers or practitioners who want to convert Chinese text into pinyin at their convenience. Motivated by these, in this work, we introduce a new benchmark dataset that consists of 99,000+ sentences for Chinese polyphone disambiguation. We train a simple Bi-LSTM model on it and find that it outperforms other pre-existing G2P systems and slightly underperforms pre-trained Chinese BERT. Finally, we package our project and share it on PyPi",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Polyphone disambiguation serves as an essential part of Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, conventional system modelling the entire Pinyin set causes the case that prediction belongs to the unrelated polyphonic character instead of the current input one, which has negative impacts on TTS performance. To address this issue, we introduce a mask-based model for polyphone disambiguation. The model takes a mask vector extracted from the context as an extra input. In our model, the mask vector not only acts as a weighting factor in Weighted-softmax to prevent the case of mis-prediction but also eliminates the contribution of non-candidate set to the overall loss. Moreover, to mitigate the uneven distribution of pronunciation, we introduce a new loss called Modified Focal Loss. The experimental result shows the effectiveness of the proposed mask-based model. We also empirically studied the impact of Weighted-softmax and Modified Focal Loss. It was found that Weighted-softmax can effectively prevent the model from predicting outside the candidate set. Besides, Modified Focal Loss can reduce the adverse impacts of the uneven distribution of pronunciation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This study tests speech-in-noise perception and social ratings of speech produced by different text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis methods. We used identical speaker training datasets for a set of 4 voices (using AWS Polly TTS), generated using neural and concatenative TTS. In Experiment 1, listeners identified target words in semantically predictable and unpredictable sentences in concatenative and neural TTS at two noise levels (-3 dB, -6 dB SNR). Correct word identification was lower for neural TTS than for concatenative TTS, in the lower SNR, and for semantically unpredictable sentences. In Experiment 2, listeners rated the voices on 4 social attributes. Neural TTS was rated as more human-like, natural, likeable, and familiar than concatenative TTS. Furthermore, how natural listeners rated the neural TTS voice was positively related to their speech-in-noise accuracy. Together, these findings show that the TTS method influences both intelligibility and social judgments of speech — and that these patterns are linked. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding of the nexus of speech technology and human speech perception",

    "abstract": "Neural sequence-to-sequence (S2S) modelling encodes a single, unified representation for each input sequence. When used for text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), such representations must embed ambiguities between English spelling and pronunciation. For example, in pothole and there the character sequence th sounds different. This can be problematic when predicting pronunciation directly from letters. We posit pronunciation becomes easier to predict when letters are grouped into sub-word units like morphemes (e.g. a boundary lies between t and h in pothole but not there). Moreover, morphological boundaries can reduce the total number of, and increase the counts of, seen unit subsequences. Accordingly, we test here the effect of augmenting input sequences of letters with morphological boundaries. We find morphological boundaries substantially lower the Word and Phone Error Rates (WER and PER) for a Bi-LSTM performing G2P on one hand, and also increase the naturalness scores of Tacotrons performing TTS in a MUSHRA listening test on the other. The improvements to TTS quality are such that grapheme input augmented with morphological boundaries outperforms phone input without boundaries. Since morphological segmentation may be predicted with high accuracy, we highlight this simple pre-processing step has important potential for S2S modelling in TTS",

We perform experiments using the evaluation results of the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 to predict the mean opinion score of synthesized speech and similarity score between synthesized speech and reference speech.

    "abstract": "Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion plays an important role in building a Mandarin Chinese text-to-speech (TTS) system, where the polyphone disambiguation is an indispensable task. However, most of the previous polyphone disambiguation models are trained on manually annotated datasets, which are suffering from data scarcity, narrow coverage, and unbalanced data distribution. In this paper, we propose a framework that can predict the pronunciations of Chinese characters, and the core model is trained in a distantly supervised way. Specifically, we utilize the alignment procedure used for acoustic models to produce abundant character-phoneme sequence pairs, which are employed to train a Seq2Seq model with attention mechanism. We also make use of a language model that is trained on phoneme sequences to alleviate the impact of noises in the auto-generated dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that even without additional syntactic features and pre-trained embeddings, our approach achieves competitive prediction results, and especially improves the predictive accuracy for unbalanced polyphonic characters. In addition, compared with the manually annotated training datasets, the auto-generated one is more diversified and makes the results more consistent with the pronunciation habits of most people",

Using a corpus of non-native and native speakers, we generated accent conversions in two different directions: non-native speakers with native accents, and native speakers with non-native accents. Then, we asked listeners to rate the similarity between 50 pairs of real or synthesized speakers. Using a linear mixed effects model, we find that (for our corpus) the effect of voice quality is five times as large as that of non-native accent, and that the effect goes away when speakers share the same (native) accent.

    "abstract": "As one popular modeling approach for end-to-end speech recognition, attention-based encoder-decoder models are known to suffer the length bias and corresponding beam problem. Different approaches have been applied in simple beam search to ease the problem, most of which are heuristic-based and require considerable tuning. We show that heuristics are not proper modeling refinement, which results in severe performance degradation with largely increased beam sizes. We propose a novel beam search derived from reinterpreting the sequence posterior with an explicit length modeling. By applying the reinterpreted probability together with beam pruning, the obtained final probability leads to a robust model modification, which allows reliable comparison among output sequences of different lengths. Experimental verification on the LibriSpeech corpus shows that the proposed approach solves the length bias problem without heuristics or additional tuning effort. It provides robust decision making and consistently good performance under both small and very large beam sizes. Compared with the best results of the heuristic baseline, the proposed approach achieves the same WER on the ‘clean' sets and 4% relative improvement on the ‘other' sets. We also show that it is more efficient with the additional derived early stopping criterion",

Specifically, the outputs of our proposed transformer include a left-to-right target, and a right-to-left target. In inference stage, we use the introduced bidirectional beam search method, which can not only generate left-to-right candidates but also generate right-to-left candidates, and determine the best hypothesis by the score To demonstrate our proposed speech transformer with a bidirectional decoder (STBD), we conduct extensive experiments on the AISHELL-1 dataset.

In addition, we also developed multi-level language model-based decoding algorithms based on a pronunciation dictionary. Besides the use of the lexicon, which is easily available, our system avoids the need of additional expert knowledge or processing steps from conventional systems. Experimental results show that phone-based BPEs tend to yield more accurate recognition systems than the character-based counterpart. In addition, further improvement can be obtained with a novel one-pass joint beam search decoder, which efficiently combines phone- and character-based BPE systems. For Switchboard, our phone-based BPE system achieves 6.8%/14.4% word error rate (WER) on the Switchboard/CallHome portion of the test set while joint decoding achieves 6.3%/13.3% WER.

This paper studies the feasibility of performing hypothesis-level combination between hybrid and end-to-end NN models. The end-to-end NN models often exhibit a bias in their posteriors toward short hypotheses, and this may adversely affect Minimum Bayes' Risk (MBR) combination methods. MBR training and length normalisation can be used to reduce this bias. Models are trained on Microsoft's 75 thousand hours of anonymised data and evaluated on test sets with 1.8 million words.

Conventional NEC algorithms use a single-stage grapheme or phoneme level edit distance to search and replace Named Entities (NEs) misrecognized by a speech recognizer. However, longer named entities like song titles cannot be easily handled by such a single stage correction. We propose a three-stage NEC, starting with a word-level matching, followed by a phonetic double metaphone based matching, and a final grapheme level candidate selection. We also propose a novel NE Rejection mechanism which is important to ensure that the NEC does not replace correctly recognized NEs with unintended but similar named entities. We evaluate our solution on two different test sets from the call and music domains, for both server as well as on-device speech recognition configurations. For the on-device model, our NEC outperforms an n-gram fusion when employed standalone. Our NEC reduces the word error rate by 14% and 63% relatively for music and call, respectively, when used after an n-gram based biasing language model.

The current study addresses these questions, testing native English speakers' judgments for 6 traits (intelligent, likeable, attractive, professional, human-like, and age) for a naturally-produced female human voice and the US-English default Amazon Alexa voice. Following exposure to the voices, participants completed these ratings for each speaker, as well as the Autism Quotient (AQ) survey, to assess individual differences in cognitive processing style. Results show differences in individuals' ratings of the likeability and human-likeness of the human and AI talkers based on AQ score.

Results showed that the emotion manipulations led to increases in perceived positive valence and excitement. Yet, the effect differed by interlocutor: increasing ‘happiness' manipulations led to larger changes for the human voice than the Alexa voice.

Time-continuous annotations offer the flexibility to explore emotional displays at different temporal resolutions while leveraging contextual information.

    "title": "Spotting the Traces of Depression in Read Speech: An Approach Based on Computational Paralinguistics and Social Signal Processing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This work investigates the use of a classification approach as a means to identify effective depression markers in read speech, i.e., observable and measurable traces of the pathology in the way people read a predefined text. This is important because the diagnosis of depression is still a challenging problem and reliable markers can, at least to a partial extent, contribute to address it. The experiments have involved 110 individuals and revolve around the tendency of depressed people to read slower and display silences that are both longer and more frequent. The results show that features expected to capture such differences reduce the error rate of a baseline classifier by more than 50% (from 31.8% to 15.5%). This is of particular interest when considering that the new features are less than 10% of the original set (3 out of 32). Furthermore, the results appear to be in line with the findings of neuroscience about brain-level differences between depressed and non-depressed individuals",

    "title": "Speech Sentiment and Customer Satisfaction Estimation in Socialbot Conversations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "For an interactive agent, such as task-oriented spoken dialog systems or chatbots, measuring and adapting to Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is critical in order to understand user perception of an agent's behavior and increase user engagement and retention. However, an agent often relies on explicit customer feedback for measuring CSAT. Such explicit feedback may result in potential distraction to users and it can be challenging to capture continuously changing user's satisfaction. To address this challenge, we present a new approach to automatically estimate CSAT using acoustic and lexical information in the Alexa Prize Socialbot data. We first explore the relationship between CSAT and sentiment scores at both the utterance and conversation level. We then investigate static and temporal modeling methods that use estimated sentiment scores as a mid-level representation. The results show that the sentiment scores, particularly valence and satisfaction, are correlated with CSAT. We also demonstrate that our proposed temporal modeling approach for estimating CSAT achieves competitive performance, relative to static baselines as well as human performance. This work provides insights into open domain social conversations between real users and socialbots, and the use of both acoustic and lexical information for understanding the relationship between CSAT and sentiment scores",

Despite its destructive power, hardly anything is known about whether there are cross-linguistic mechanisms and acoustic-phonetic characteristics of hate speech. For this reason, our experiment analyzes the implicit prosodies that are caused by written Twitter and Facebook hate-speech items and made phonetically \"tangible\" through a special, introspective reading-aloud task. We compare the elicited (implicit) prosodies of Danish and German speakers with respect to f0, intensity, HNR, and the Hammarberg index. While we found no evidence for a consistent hate-speech-specific prosody either within or between the two languages, our results show clear prosodic differences associated with types of hate speech and their targeted minority groups. Moreover, language-specific differences suggest that — compared to Danish — German hate speech sounds more expressive and hateful.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Human voices vary in their perceived masculinity or femininity, and subjective gender scores provided by human raters have long been used in psychological studies to understand the complex psychosocial relationships between people. However, there has been limited research on developing objective gender scoring of voices and examining the correlation between objective gender scores (including the weighting of each acoustic factor) and subjective gender scores (i.e., perceived masculinity/ femininity). In this work we propose a gender scoring model based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and using weakly labelled data to objectively rate speakers' masculinity and femininity. For 434 speakers, we investigated 29 acoustic measures of voice characteristics and their relationships to both the objective scores and subjective masculinity/femininity ratings. The results revealed close correspondence between objective scores and subjective ratings of masculinity for males and femininity for females (correlations of 0.667 and 0.505 respectively). Among the 29 measures, F0 was found to be the most important vocal characteristic influencing both objective and subjective ratings for both sexes. For female voices, local absolute jitter and Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) were moderately associated with objective scores. For male voices, F0 variance influenced objective gender scores more than the subjective ratings provided by human listeners",

    "title": "How Ordinal Are Your Data?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many affective computing datasets are annotated using ordinal scales, as are many other forms of ground truth involving subjectivity, e.g. depression severity. When investigating these datasets, the speech processing community has chosen classification problems in some cases, and regression in others, while ordinal regression may also arguably be the correct approach for some. However, there is currently essentially no guidance on selecting a suitable machine learning and evaluation method. To investigate this problem, this paper proposes a neural network-based framework which can transition between different modelling methods with the help of a novel multi-term loss function. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the proposed framework is empirically well-behaved and able to correctly identify classification-like, ordinal regression-like and regression-like properties within multidimensional datasets. Application of the proposed framework to six real datasets widely used in affective computing and related fields suggests that more focus should be placed on ordinal regression instead of classifying or predicting, which are the common practices to date",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A significant question for forensic voice comparison, and for speaker recognition more generally, is the extent to which different input features capture complementary speaker-specific information. Understanding complementarity allows us to make predictions about how combining methods using different features may produce better overall performance. In forensic contexts, it is also important to be able to explain to courts what information the underlying features are actually capturing. This paper addresses these issues by examining the extent to which MFCCs and LPCCs can predict F0, F1, F2, and F3 values using data extracted from the midpoint of the vocalic portion of the hesitation marker um for 89 speakers of standard southern British English. By-speaker correlations were calculated using multiple linear regression and performance was assessed using mean rho (ρ) values. Results show that the first two formants were more accurately predicted than F3 or F0. LPCCs consistently produced stronger correlations with the linguistic features than MFCCs, while increasing cepstral order up to 16 also increased the strength of the correlations. There was, however, considerable variability across speakers in terms of the accuracy of the predictions. We discuss the implications of these findings for forensic voice comparison",

    "abstract": "Several studies have shown that rhetorical wh-questions (RQs) and string-identical information-seeking wh-questions (ISQs) are realized with different prosodic characteristics. In contrast to ISQs, RQs have been shown to be phonetically realized with a breathier (i.e., softer) voice quality (e.g., German and English) and longer constituent durations (e.g., German, English, Icelandic). Based on similar results found for different languages, we investigate wh-RQs and sting-identical wh-ISQs in Brazilian Portuguese (BP) and German (G). We analyze (i) whether specific duration and voice-quality patterns characterize and separate the two illocution types (RQ and ISQ) in BP, and (ii) if direct measures of the respiratory sub-system reveal differences between illocution types, given that breathiness involves greater transglottal air flow which can be observed in the speakers' chest and/or abdomen movement Our data suggest that, similar to G, English, and Icelandic, duration and voice quality patterns play a role in the realization of RQs compared to ISQs in BP, reinforcing the assumption that there are cross-linguistically similar phonetic features in the realization of RQs compared to ISQs. We also find that speakers of G breathe in more deeply and dynamically than speakers of BP, suggesting a link between breathing and voice quality",

    "abstract": "Clause chains are a syntactic strategy for combining multiple clauses into a single unit. They are reported in many languages, including Korean and Turkish. However, they have seen relatively little focused research. In particular, prosodic features are often mentioned in descriptions of clause chaining, however there have been vanishingly few investigations. Corpus-based studies of the prosody of clause chains in two unrelated languages of Papua New Guinea report that they are typically produced as a sequence of Intonation phrases united by pitch-scaling of the L% boundary tones in each clause with only the final, finite, clause descending to a full L%. The present study is the first experimental investigation of the prosody of clause chains in Pitjantjatjara This paper focuses on one type of clause chain found in the Australian Indigenous language Pitjantjatjara. We examine a set of 120 clause chains read out by three native Pitjantjatjara speakers. Prosodic analysis reveals that these Pitjantjatjara clause chains are produced within a single Intonational Phrase. Speakers do not pause between the clauses in the chain, there is consistent linear downstep throughout the phrase and additionally phrase final lowering occurs at the end of the utterance. This differs from previous impressionistic studies of the prosody of clause chains",

Previous work has shown that topics and foci are typically associated with different pitch events, whereas it is still a matter of debate whether and how Egyptian Arabic uses prominence relations to mark narrow focus. The analysis of data from 17 native speakers showed that narrow focus was marked by on-focus pitch expansion as well as post-focus compression. Post-focus compression was realized as a large downstep after focus, compressed pitch range, lower intensity and shorter duration. The results also showed further register lowering after a contrastive focus, but no further pitch boost of the focused word. By contrast, a contrastive topic showed higher scaling of the topic as well as an expanded pitch range of the overall contour. The findings of this study stress the significance of whole contours to convey intonational meanings, revealing gradient prominence cues to focus across the utterance, specifically post-focus register lowering to enhance the prominence of a contrastive focus",

Drummed forms of languages represent one of the most extreme natural expressions of such speech adaptability.

However, in spite of the clearly rhythmic nature of drumming, previous studies have largely neglected exploring systematically the role of speech rhythm. Here, we explore a unique corpus of the Bendré drummed speech form of the Mossi people, transcribed published in the 80's by the anthropologist Kawada Junzo. The analysis of this large database in Mooré language reveals that the rhythmic units encoded in the length of pauses between drumbeats match more closely with vowel-to-vowel intervals than with syllable parsing. Meanwhile, we confirm for the first time a result found recently on the drummed speech tradition of the Bora Amazonian language. However, the complex acoustic structure of the Bendré skin drum required much more attention than the simple two pitch hollow log drum of the Bora. Thus, we also present here results on how drummed Bendré timbre encodes tones of Mooré language",

Overall, results show that Tone 3 tends to have the longest duration among all lexical tones. Nonetheless, the factors word length, syllable position and prosodic position are found to impact tone duration. Monosyllabic words exhibit tone durations closer to those of word-final syllables (especially for disyllabic words) than to other syllable positions. Moreover, tone duration tends to be the longest at word's right boundary in Mandarin, regardless of word length. An effect of prosodic position is also found: the duration of Mandarin lexical tones tends to increase with higher prosodic level. Tone durations are the longest in phrase-final position, followed by word-final position and word-medial position, regardless of the tone nature",

In this study, we tested the use of target approximation model (TAM) for continuous tone recognition on two datasets. TAM simulates f production from the articulatory point of view and so allow to discover the underlying pitch targets from the surface f contour. The f contour of each tone represented by 30 equidistant points in the first dataset was simulated by the TAM model. Using a support vector machine (SVM) to classify tones showed that, compared to the representation by 30 f values, the estimated three-dimensional TAM parameters had a comparable performance in characterizing tone patterns. The TAM model was further tested on the second dataset containing more complex tonal variations. With equal or a fewer number of features, the TAM parameters provided better performance than the coefficients of the cosine transform and a slightly worse performance than the statistical f parameters for tone recognition. Furthermore, we investigated bidirectional LSTM neural network for modelling the sequential tonal variations, which proved to be more powerful than the SVM classifier. The BLSTM system incorporating TAM and statistical f parameters achieved the best accuracy of 87.56%",

    "abstract": "Chinese third tone sandhi (T3S) covaries with the prosodic hierarchy both in the probability of application and in the realization of pitch slope. This paper evaluates whether Mandarin-speaking listeners integrate the covariation between T3S and prosody to resolute sentence ambiguity. Twenty-seven structurally ambiguous sentences were designed, each containing two consecutive T3 syllables situated across a word boundary, and the strength of the T3-intervening boundary crucially differentiates different interpretations of the sentence. The first T3 was manipulated to bear either a low, a shallow-rising, or a sharp-rising pitch. Sixty native Mandarin-speaking listeners heard each of these sentences and chose from two written interpretations the one that was consistent with what they heard. The results show that listeners are more likely to report a major-juncture interpretation when T3S does not apply (low) than when it applies (rising), and in the latter case, when the T3S variant has a sharper rather than shallower slope. Post-hoc analyses show that the T3S application is a more robust parsing cue for short sentences (4–5 syllables long), whereas the pitch shape of T3S is a more efficient parsing cue for longer sentences, indicating that listeners make sophisticated use of tonal variation to facilitate sentence processing",

Neutral tone in Changde Mandarin is different from that in Beijing Mandarin or Standard Chinese. Neutral tone in Changde Mandarin is a reduced form of its citation tone, which is produced with a neutralized pitch height, and a significantly shorter duration and weaker intensity than the control",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Northeastern Mandarin has a similar lexical tone system as Beijing Mandarin. However, the two dialects significantly diverge at higher prosodic structures. T1 in Northeastern Mandarin always changes to a falling tone in domain-final positions. Previous studies have analyzed this variation as a type of tone sandhi, but we propose it is related to more global prosodic processes such as final lowering. We addressed this issue by conducting both production and perception experiments with native bidialectal speakers of Northeastern Mandarin and Beijing Mandarin. Our findings suggest that T1 variation is essentially a domain-final lowering effect. Other tones also show some kind of final lowering effects. Compared to Beijing Mandarin, Northeastern Mandarin generally has greater global pitch declination and greater final lowering effects. Our perception experiment further showed that both prosodic effects play important roles in identifying the Northeastern Mandarin accent, and final lowering cues are more perceptually salient than the global declination cues. These findings support the notion that pitch declination and final lowering effects are linguistically controlled, not just a by-product of the physiological mechanisms",

Significant correlation between F0 and both spectral slope and interharmonic noise is demonstrated. It is shown with probabilistic bivariate discriminant analysis that even tones with no extrinsic voice quality differences can be identified at rates considerably above chance from a combination of their spectral slope and interharmonic noise. Male tones, with a minimal error rate of 5.7%, are identified twice as well as female, with a minimal error rate of 14.5%. Combinations with uncorrected spectral slopes perform better than corrected. The best combinations for both sexes involve slope parameters H2H4 (difference between the 4 and 2 harmonic amplitudes); and H42K (difference between the 4 harmonic and nearest harmonic to 2 kHz), irrespective of noise parameters. The worst combinations involve CPP (cepstral peak prominence) as a noise parameter",

Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, while results regarding the rate effect on Mandarin tones in previous studies were mixed, probably driven by the material difference, i.e., the position of target tones within a sentence. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of speaking rate on Mandarin tones, comparing the pitch contour and tonal contrast of Mandarin tones between normal and fast speech across utterance initial, medial and final positions. The results showed that, relative to normal speech, lexical tones in Mandarin Chinese exhibited overall higher and flatter pitch contours, with smaller tonal space. Moreover, the rate effect on tones did not vary with position. The current results and previous studies on segments thus revealed a universal pattern of speech reduction in fast speech at both segmental and suprasegmental levels",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Latency is a crucial metric for streaming speech recognition systems. In this paper, we reduce latency by fetching responses early based on the partial recognition results and refer to it as prefetching. Specifically, prefetching works by submitting partial recognition results for subsequent processing such as obtaining assistant server responses or second-pass rescoring before the recognition result is finalized. If the partial result matches the final recognition result, the early fetched response can be delivered to the user instantly. This effectively speeds up the system by saving the execution latency that typically happens after recognition is completed Prefetching can be triggered multiple times for a single query, but this leads to multiple rounds of downstream processing and increases the computation costs. It is hence desirable to fetch the result sooner but meanwhile limiting the number of prefetches. To achieve the best trade-off between latency and computation cost, we investigated a series of prefetching decision models including decoder silence based prefetching, acoustic silence based prefetching and end-to-end prefetching In this paper, we demonstrate the proposed prefetching mechanism reduced latency by ~200 ms for a system that consists of a streaming first pass model using recurrent neural network transducer and a non-streaming second pass rescoring model using Listen, Attend and Spell. We observe that the end-to-end prefetching provides the best trade-off between cost and latency and is 120 ms faster compared to silence based prefetching at a fixed prefetch rate",

    "abstract": "Wakeword detection is responsible for switching on downstream systems in a voice-activated device. To prevent a response when the wakeword is detected by mistake, a secondary network is often utilized to verify the detected wakeword. Published verification approaches are formulated based on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) biased towards the wakeword. This approach has several drawbacks, including high model complexity and the necessity of large vocabulary training data. To address these shortcomings, we propose to use a large receptive field (LRF) word-level wakeword model, and in particular, a convolutional-recurrent-attention (CRA) network. CRA networks use a strided small receptive field convolutional front-end followed by fixed time-step recurrent layers optimized to model the temporal phonetic dependencies within the wakeword. We experimentally show that this type of modeling helps the system to be robust to errors in the location of the wakeword as estimated by the detection network. The proposed CRA network significantly outperforms previous baselines, including an LRF whole-word convolutional network and a 2-stage DNN-HMM system. Additionally, we study the importance of pre- and post-wakeword context. Finally, the CRA network has significantly fewer model parameters and multiplies, which makes it suitable for real-world production applications",

    "abstract": "In recent years, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have been attracting interest for many applications and generative tasks. Although the VAE is one of the most powerful deep generative models, it still has difficulty representing complex-valued data such as the complex spectra of speech. In speech synthesis, we usually use the VAE to encode Mel-cepstra, or raw amplitude spectra, from a speech signal into normally distributed latent features and then synthesize the speech from the reconstruction by using the Griffin-Lim algorithm or other vocoders. Such inputs are originally calculated from complex spectra but lack the phase information, which leads to degradation when recovering speech. In this work, we propose a novel generative model to directly encode the complex spectra by extending the conventional VAE. The proposed model, which we call the complex-valued VAE (CVAE), consists of two complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) of an encoder and a decoder. In the CVAE, not only the inputs and the parameters of the encoder and decoder but also the latent features are defined as complex-valued to preserve the phase information throughout the network. The results of our speech encoding experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the CVAE compared to the conventional VAE in both objective and subjective criteria",

Recently, cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN)-VC and CycleGAN-VC2 have shown promising results regarding this problem and have been widely used as benchmark methods. However, owing to the ambiguity of the effectiveness of CycleGAN-VC/VC2 for mel-spectrogram conversion, they are typically used for mel-cepstrum conversion even when comparative methods employ mel-spectrogram as a conversion target. To address this, we examined the applicability of CycleGAN-VC/VC2 to mel-spectrogram conversion. Through initial experiments, we discovered that their direct applications compromised the time-frequency structure that should be preserved during conversion. To remedy this, we propose CycleGAN-VC3, an improvement of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates time-frequency adaptive normalization (TFAN). Using TFAN, we can adjust the scale and bias of the converted features while reflecting the time-frequency structure of the source mel-spectrogram. We evaluated CycleGAN-VC3 on inter-gender and intra-gender non-parallel VC.

The key component of proposed system is Duration Informed Attention Network (DurIAN), an autoregressive model in which the alignments between the input text and the output acoustic features are inferred from a duration model. This is different from the attention mechanism used in existing end-to-end speech synthesis systems that accounts for various unavoidable artifacts. To improve the audio generation efficiency of neural vocoders, we also propose a multi-band audio generation framework exploiting the sparseness characteristics of neural network. With proposed multi-band processing framework, the total computational complexity of WaveRNN model can be effectively reduced from 9.8 to 3.6 GFLOPS without any performance loss. Finally, we show that proposed DurIAN system could generate highly natural speech that is on par with current state of the art end-to-end systems, while being robust and stable at the same time",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-speaker speech synthesis is a technique for modeling multiple speakers' voices with a single model. Although many approaches using deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proposed, DNNs are prone to overfitting when the amount of training data is limited. We propose a framework for multi-speaker speech synthesis using deep Gaussian processes (DGPs); a DGP is a deep architecture of Bayesian kernel regressions and thus robust to overfitting. In this framework, speaker information is fed to duration/acoustic models using speaker codes. We also examine the use of deep Gaussian process latent variable models (DGPLVMs). In this approach, the representation of each speaker is learned simultaneously with other model parameters, and therefore the similarity or dissimilarity of speakers is considered efficiently. We experimentally evaluated two situations to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In one situation, the amount of data from each speaker is balanced (speaker-balanced), and in the other, the data from certain speakers are limited (speaker-imbalanced). Subjective and objective evaluation results showed that both the DGP and DGPLVM synthesize multi-speaker speech more effective than a DNN in the speaker-balanced situation. We also found that the DGPLVM outperforms the DGP significantly in the speaker-imbalanced situation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Conventional text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis requires extensive linguistic processing for producing quality output. The advent of end-to-end (E2E) systems has caused a relocation in the paradigm with better synthesized voices. However, hidden Markov model (HMM) based systems are still popular due to their fast synthesis time, robustness to less training data, and flexible adaptation of voice characteristics, speaking styles, and emotions This paper proposes a technique that combines the classical parametric HMM-based TTS framework (HTS) with the neural-network-based Waveglow vocoder using histogram equalization (HEQ) in a low resource environment. The two paradigms are combined by performing HEQ across mel-spectrograms extracted from HTS generated audio and source spectra of training data. During testing, the synthesized mel-spectrograms are mapped to the source spectrograms using the learned HEQ. Experiments are carried out on Hindi male and female dataset of the Indic TTS database. Systems are evaluated based on degradation mean opinion scores (DMOS). Results indicate that the synthesis quality of the hybrid system is better than that of the conventional HTS system. These results are quite promising as they pave way to good quality TTS systems with less data compared to E2E systems",

First, those well-designed features extremely rely on human expert domain knowledge, which may restrain the collaboration work across fields. Second, the features extracted in such a brute-force scenario may not be easy to be transferred to another task, which means a series of new features should be designed. To this end, we introduce a method based on a transfer learning strategy combined with data augmentation techniques for the ComParE 2020 Challenge Mask Sub-Challenge. Unlike the previous studies mainly based on pre-trained models by image data, we use a pre-trained model based on large scale audio data, i. e., AudioSet. In addition, the SpecAugment and mixup methods are used to improve the generalisation of the deep models. Experimental results demonstrate that the best-proposed model can significantly (p < .001, by one-tailed z-test) improve the unweighted average recall (UAR) from 71.8% (baseline) to 76.2% on the test set.

Under the assumption that each phoneme sounds differently among clear and mask speech, the model is then used to compute frame-wise phonetic labels for the challenge data, including information about the presence of a surgical mask. These labels served to train a second phoneme recognition model which is finally able to differentiate between mask and clear phoneme productions.

These discrepancies are especially prominent in the posterior lattices between an offline model and a streaming model, which can be expected from the fact that the streaming RNN-T emits symbols later than the offline RNN-T. We propose a method to train an RNN-T so that the posterior peaks at each node in the posterior lattice are aligned with the ones from a pretrained model for the same utterance. By utilizing this method, we can train an offline RNN-T that can serve as a good teacher to train a student streaming RNN-T.

    "abstract": "Recent advances of end-to-end models have outperformed conventional models through employing a two-pass model. The two-pass model provides better speed-quality trade-offs for on-device speech recognition, where a 1 st-pass model generates hypotheses in a streaming fashion, and a 2 nd-pass model rescores the hypotheses with full audio sequence context. The 2 nd-pass model plays a key role in the quality improvement of the end-to-end model to surpass the conventional model. One main challenge of the two-pass model is the computation latency introduced by the 2 nd-pass model. Specifically, the original design of the two-pass model uses LSTMs for the 2 nd-pass model, which are subject to long latency as they are constrained by the recurrent nature and have to run inference sequentially. In this work we explore replacing the LSTM layers in the 2 nd-pass rescorer with Transformer layers, which can process the entire hypothesis sequences in parallel and can therefore utilize the on-device computation resources more efficiently. Compared with an LSTM-based baseline, our proposed Transformer rescorer achieves more than 50% latency reduction with quality improvement",

    "abstract": "Streaming ASR is gaining momentum due to its wide applicability, though it is still unclear how best to come close to the accuracy of state-of-the-art off-line ASR systems when the output must come within a short delay after the incoming audio stream. Following our previous work on streaming one-pass decoding with hybrid ASR systems and LSTM language models, in this work we report further improvements by replacing LSTMs with Transformer models. First, two key ideas are discussed so as to run these models fast during inference. Then, empirical results on LibriSpeech and TED-LIUM are provided showing that Transformer language models lead to improved recognition rates on both tasks. ASR systems obtained in this work can be seamlessly transferred to a streaming setup with minimal quality losses. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, no better results have been reported on these tasks when assessed under a streaming setup",

However, it requires access to the full sequence, and the computational cost grows quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. These factors limit its adoption for streaming applications. In this work, we proposed a novel augmented memory self-attention, which attends on a short segment of the input sequence and a bank of memories. The memory bank stores the embedding information for all the processed segments. On the librispeech benchmark, our proposed method outperforms all the existing streamable transformer methods by a large margin and achieved over 15% relative error reduction, compared with the widely used LC-BLSTM baseline.

    "abstract": "We investigate a monotonic multihead attention (MMA) by extending hard monotonic attention to Transformer-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) for online streaming applications. For streaming inference, all monotonic attention (MA) heads should learn proper alignments because the next token is not generated until all heads detect the corresponding token boundaries. However, we found not all MA heads learn alignments with a naïve implementation. To encourage every head to learn alignments properly, we propose HeadDrop regularization by masking out a part of heads stochastically during training. Furthermore, we propose to prune redundant heads to improve consensus among heads for boundary detection and prevent delayed token generation caused by such heads. Chunkwise attention on each MA head is extended to the multihead counterpart. Finally, we propose head-synchronous beam search decoding to guarantee stable streaming inference",

LC-SAN-M uses chunk-level input to control the latency of encoder. As to SCAMA, a jointly trained predictor is used to control the output of encoder when feeding to decoder, which enables decoder to generate output in streaming manner. Experimental results on the open 170-hour AISHELL-1 and an industrial-level 20000-hour Mandarin speech recognition tasks show that our approach can significantly outperform the MoChA-based baseline system under comparable setup.

However, when it comes to performing run-on recognition on an input stream of audio data while producing recognition results in real-time and with low word-based latency, these models face several challenges. For many techniques, the whole audio sequence to be decoded needs to be available at the start of the processing, e.g., for the attention mechanism or the bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM). In this paper, we propose several techniques to mitigate these problems. We introduce an additional loss function controlling the uncertainty of the attention mechanism, a modified beam search identifying partial, stable hypotheses, ways of working with BLSTM in the encoder, and the use of chunked BLSTM. Our experiments show that with the right combination of these techniques, it is possible to perform run-on speech recognition with low word-based latency without sacrificing in word error rate performance",

TL can be applied to end-to-end (E2E) ASR system such as recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) models, by initializing the encoder and/or prediction network of the target language with the pre-trained models from source language. In the hybrid ASR system, transfer learning is typically done by initializing the target language acoustic model (AM) with source language AM. Several transfer learning strategies exist in the case of the RNN-T framework, depending upon the choice of the initialization model for encoder and prediction networks. This paper presents a comparative study of four different TL methods for RNN-T framework. We show 10%–17% relative word error rate reduction with different TL methods over randomly initialized RNN-T model. We also study the impact of TL with varying amount of training data ranging from 50 hours to 1000 hours and show the efficacy of TL for languages with a very small amount of training data",

We trained and evaluated our systems in the Interspeech 2020 ADReSS challenge dataset, containing 78 AD patients and 78 sex and age-matched controls. Our results indicate that the fusion of scores obtained from the acoustic and the transcript-based models provides the best detection and assessment results, suggesting that individual models for two modalities contain complementary information. The addition of the silence-related features improved the fusion system even further.

Individuals who are affected by dementia experience deterioration in their capacity to perform day-to-day tasks thereby significantly affecting their quality of life. This paper addresses the Interspeech 2020 Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) challenge where the objective is to propose methods for two tasks. The first task is to identify speech recordings from individuals with dementia amongst a set of recordings which also include those from healthy individuals. The second task requires participants to estimate the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score based on an individual's speech alone. To this end, we investigated characteristics of speech paralinguistics such as prosody, voice quality, and spectra as well as VGGish based deep acoustic embedding for automated screening for dementia based on the audio modality.

    "abstract": "Forensic audio analysis for speaker verification offers unique challenges due to location/scenario uncertainty and diversity mismatch between reference and naturalistic field recordings. The lack of real naturalistic forensic audio corpora with ground-truth speaker identity represents a major challenge in this field. It is also difficult to directly employ small-scale domain-specific data to train complex neural network architectures due to domain mismatch and loss in performance. Alternatively, cross-domain speaker verification for multiple acoustic environments is a challenging task which could advance research in audio forensics. In this study, we introduce a CRSS-Forensics audio dataset collected in multiple acoustic environments. We pre-train a CNN-based network using the VoxCeleb data, followed by an approach which fine-tunes part of the high-level network layers with clean speech from CRSS-Forensics. Based on this fine-tuned model, we align domain-specific distributions in the embedding space with the discrepancy loss and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). This maintains effective performance on the clean set, while simultaneously generalizes the model to other acoustic domains.

By leveraging large-scale out-of-domain datasets, a knowledge distillation based objective function is proposed for teacher-student learning, which is applied for short utterance forensic speaker verification. The objective function collectively considers speaker classification loss, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and similarity of embeddings. In order to advance the trained deep speaker embedding network to be robust for a small target dataset, we introduce a novel strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained student model towards a forensic target domain by utilizing the model as a finetuning start point and a reference in regularization. The proposed approaches are evaluated on the 1 48-UTD forensic corpus, a newly established naturalistic dataset of actual homicide investigations consisting of short utterances recorded in uncontrolled conditions. We show that the proposed objective function can efficiently improve the performance of teacher-student learning on short utterances and that our fine-tuning strategy outperforms the commonly used weight decay method by providing an explicit inductive bias towards the pre-trained model",

Spoken voice, however, exhibits a limited range of possible speaker dynamics, thus constraining the utility of the derived speaker recognition models. Singing voice, on the other hand, covers a broader range of vocal and ambient factors and can, therefore, be used to evaluate the robustness of a speaker recognition system. However, a majority of existing speaker recognition datasets only focus on the spoken voice. In comparison, there is a significant shortage of labeled singing voice data suitable for speaker recognition research. To address this issue, we assemble JukeBox — a speaker recognition dataset with multilingual singing voice audio annotated with singer identity, gender, and language labels. We use the current state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the difficulty of performing speaker recognition on singing voice using models trained on spoken voice alone.

    "abstract": "Speaker identification based on voice input is a fundamental capability in speech processing enabling versatile downstream applications, such as personalization and authentication. With the advent of deep learning, most state-of-the-art methods apply machine learning techniques and derive acoustic embeddings from utterances with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This paper addresses two inherent limitations of current approaches. First, voice characteristics over long time spans might not be fully captured by CNNs and RNNs, as they are designed to focus on local feature extraction and adjacent dependencies modeling, respectively. Second, complex deep learning models can be fragile with regard to subtle but intentional changes in model inputs, also known as adversarial perturbations. To distill informative global acoustic embedding representations from utterances and be robust to adversarial perturbations, we propose a Self-Attentive Adversarial Speaker-Identification method ( SAASI).

In this paper, we propose to use metadata information as an additional input feature to improve the performance of a single CNN keyword -spotting model under different conditions. We design a new network architecture for metadata-aware end-to-end keyword spotting which learns to convert the categorical metadata to a fixed length embedding, and then uses the embedding to: 1) modulate convolutional feature maps via conditional batch normalization, and 2) contribute to the fully connected layer via feature concatenation. The experiment shows that the proposed architecture is able to learn the meta-specific characteristics from combined datasets, and the best candidate achieves an average relative false reject rate (FRR) improvement of 14.63% at the same false accept rate (FAR) compared with CNN that does not use device state metadata",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) plays an important role in multiple fields such as healthcare, human-computer interaction (HCI), and security and defense. Emotional labels are often annotated at the sentence-level (i.e., one label per sentence), resulting in a sequence-to-one recognition problem. Traditionally, studies have relied on statistical descriptions, which are computed over time from low level descriptors (LLDs), creating a fixed dimension sentence-level feature representation regardless of the duration of the sentence. However sentence-level features lack temporal information, which limits the performance of SER systems. Recently, new deep learning architectures have been proposed to model temporal data. An important question is how to extract emotion-relevant features with temporal information. This study proposes a novel data processing approach that extracts a fixed number of small chunks over sentences of different durations by changing the overlap between these chunks. The approach is flexible, providing an ideal framework to combine gated network or attention mechanisms with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our experimental results based on the MSP-Podcast dataset demonstrate that the proposed method not only significantly improves recognition accuracy over alternative temporal-based models relying on LSTM, but also leads to computational efficiency",

In this paper we propose a deeper neural network architecture wherein we fuse Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Highway Network to learn powerful discriminative features which are robust to noise. We also propose data augmentation with our network architecture to further improve the robustness. We comprehensively evaluate the architecture coupled with data augmentation against (1) noise, (2) adversarial attacks and (3) cross-corpus settings. Our evaluations on the widely used IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets show promising results when compared with existing studies and state-of-the-art models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Emotion labels in emotion recognition corpora are highly noisy and ambiguous, due to the annotators' subjective perception of emotions. Such ambiguity may introduce errors in automatic classification and affect the overall performance. We therefore propose a dynamic label correction and sample contribution weight estimation model. Our model is based on a standard BLSTM model with attention with two extra parameters. The first learns a new corrected label distribution and aims to fix the inaccurate labels in the dataset. The other estimates the contribution of each sample to the training process and aims to ignore the ambiguous and noisy samples while giving higher weights to the clear ones. We train our model through an alternating optimization method, where in the first epoch we update the neural network parameters, and in the second we keep them fixed to update the label correction and sample importance parameters. When training and evaluating our model on the IEMOCAP dataset, we obtained a weighted accuracy (WA) and unweighted accuracy (UA) of 65.9% and 61.4%, respectively. This yielded an absolute improvement of 2.3% and 1.9%, respectively, compared to a BLSTM with attention baseline, trained on the corpus gold labels",

    "abstract": "As the fundamental research of affective computing, speech emotion recognition (SER) has gained a lot of attention. Unlike with common deep learning tasks, SER was restricted by the scarcity of emotional speech datasets. In this paper, the vector quantization variational automatic encoder (VQ-VAE) was introduced and trained by massive unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner. Benefiting from the excellent invariant distribution encoding capability and discrete embedding space of VQ-VAE, the pre-trained VQ-VAE could learn latent representation from labeled data. The extracted latent representation could serve as the additional source data to make data abundantly available. While solving data lacking issue, sequence information modeling was also taken into account which was considered useful for SER. The proposed sequence model, temporal attention convolutional network (TACN) was simple yet good at learning contextual information from limited data which was not friendly to complicated structures of recurrent neural network (RNN) based sequence models. To validate the effectiveness of the latent representation, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was introduced to analyze the visualizations. To verify the performance of the proposed TACN, quantitative classification results of all commonly used sequence models were provided.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Research on affective computing has achieved remarkable success with the development of deep learning. One of the major difficulties in emotion recognition is inconsistent criteria for emotion categorization between multiple corpora. Most previous studies using multiple corpora discard or merge a part of their emotion classes. This prescription causes catastrophic information loss with respect to emotion categorization. Furthermore, the influences of corpus-specific factors other than emotions, such as languages, speech registers, and recording environments, should be eliminated to fully utilize multiple corpora. In this paper, we address the challenge of reconciling multiple emotion corpora by learning a corpus-independent emotion encoding disentangled from all the remaining factors without causing catastrophic information loss. For this purpose, we propose a model that consists of a shared emotion encoder, multiple emotion classifiers, and an adversarial corpus discriminator. This model is trained with multi-task learning harnessed by adversarial learning. We conducted speech emotion classification experiments with our method on two corpora, namely, EmoDB and CREMA-D. The results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracies than mono-corpus models. In addition, it is indicated that the proposed method suppresses corpus-dependent factors other than emotions in the embedding space",

In this work, we explore a spectral decomposition method stemming from fluid-dynamics, known as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), to computationally represent and analyze the global utterance-level dynamics of emotional speech. Specifically, segment-level emotion-specific representations are first learned through an Emotion Distillation process. This forms a multi-dimensional signal of emotion flow for each utterance, called Emotion Profiles (EPs). The DMD algorithm is then applied to the resultant EPs to capture the eigenfrequencies, and hence the fundamental transition dynamics of the emotion flow. Evaluation experiments using the proposed approach, which we call EigenEmo, show promising results. Moreover, due to the positive combination of their complementary properties, concatenating the utterance representations generated by EigenEmo with simple EPs averaging yields noticeable gains",

One of the main challenges in practice is that most of the existing emotion corpora do not give ground truth labels for each segment; instead, we only have labels for whole utterances. To extract segment-level emotional information from such weakly labeled emotion corpora, we propose using multiple instance learning (MIL) to learn segment embeddings in a weakly supervised manner. Also, for a sufficiently long utterance, not all of the segments contain relevant emotional information. In this regard, three attention-based neural network models are then applied to the learned segment embeddings to attend the most salient part of a speech utterance.

However, not much is known about the impact of individual foreign-accented segments on listeners with different levels of proficiency in the language. Using a technique developed to generate degrees of segmental foreign accent, this study investigates how native and non-native listeners differing in language proficiency categorise and discriminate degrees of accentedness at the segmental level. Listeners responded to continua ranging from Spanish-accented tokens to English tokens, constructed by inserting accented segments into words. Six continua were chosen, based on known problems faced by Spanish speakers of English. Whether foreign accent categorisation performance differed across native and non-native listeners was found to depend on the status of the segment in the listeners' first language. For certain sounds both high and low proficiency non-native groups resembled native listener responses. For other sounds, categorisation revealed a clear effect of proficiency, with the high-proficiency group closer to native performance than the low proficiency cohort. This behaviour indicates an ongoing process of new second language phonemic category creation by the more proficient learners",

    "abstract": "To perceive a second language (L2), non-native speakers not only have to focus on phonological, lexical and grammatical knowledge, but also need to develop a good mastery of L2 strategic knowledge, including selective attention and language planning. Previous research has found that non-tonal speakers are overtly attentive to segments, while tonal language speakers give more attention to tones. However, it is unclear how different dominant language speakers distribute their attention when processing both segments and tones in non-native speeches. In the current study Cantonese native speakers, Cantonese-dominants, and Urdu-dominants participated in an attention distribution experiment in Cantonese. The results show that the Urdu-dominants retain their L1 attentional strategy in the processing of Cantonese stimuli, classifying the stimuli along segments, while the Cantonese native speakers are more attentive to tones. Moreover, the Cantonese-dominants perform either in monolingual mode or bilingual mode according to different tasks, showing a perceptual flexibility in highly proficient and experienced listeners. The results reveal that language dominance plays a vital role in listeners' attention distribution. The research also supports the ASP model and hypothesis on bilinguals, proposed by [1]",

Our focus is on an understudied aspect of bilingual cognition, specifically phonetic learning. We presented 36 participants (17 monolinguals and 19 early bilinguals) living in New York City with an artificially constructed accent of English, differing in four ways from Standard American English. More precisely, the novel accent included a vocalic change (diphthongization of the open-mid front unrounded vowel), consonantal change (tapping of intervocalic liquids), syllable structure change (epenthesis in voiceless s-clusters) and suprasegmental change (a novel intonation pattern in tag questions). After recording their baseline accents, the participants first completed a training task, in which they listened to and then directly imitated sentences heard in the novel accent, and then a testing task, in which they were asked to read the baseline sentences in the accent they had just learned in the absence of any audio prompts. In this paper, we present acoustic results with diphthongization and tag question intonation. Our findings replicate the previously observed bilingual advantage in phonetic learning across the board and extend it to novel learning circumstances",

Mandarin data is closely matched with the Mandarin part in the code-switching data, while English data is not. However, Mandarin data only helps on those utterances that are significantly Mandarin-dominated. Besides, there is a balance point, over which more monolingual data will divert the CSSR system, degrading results.

The role and nature of the cue covariation have been much debated in the literature, identifying the physiological link in production, perceptual integration, and enhancement as the key factors in play. In this study, we test whether the enhancement role of covarying cues are influenced by yet another factor: the interaction between cues at multiple layers of phonological structure. We hypothesize that further enhancement of the cue covariations occurs in contexts where acoustic cues are in competition for phonological contrasts at multiple prosodic levels. To test this, we investigate the enhancement role of the covariation relationship between F0 and spectral cues in Mandarin and Thai tones in different phrasal positions. Exploratory and multidimensional-scaling analyses suggest that in Mandarin, the phrase-final weakening of F0 cues are compensated by enhancing the spectral cues, while in Thai, tonal category-specific enhancement is observed at all phrasal positions. The context- and category-specific enhancement of covarying cues suggests that the language's phonological structure plays an important role in the fine-tuning of cue covariations",

    "abstract": "In noisy conditions, knowing speech contents facilitates listeners to more effectively suppress background noise components and to retrieve pure speech signals. Previous studies have also confirmed the benefits of incorporating phonetic information in a speech enhancement (SE) system to achieve better denoising performance. To obtain the phonetic information, we usually prepare a phoneme-based acoustic model, which is trained using speech waveforms and phoneme labels. Despite performing well in normal noisy conditions, when operating in very noisy conditions, however, the recognized phonemes may be erroneous and thus misguide the SE process. To overcome the limitation, this study proposes to incorporate the broad phonetic class (BPC) information into the SE process. We have investigated three criteria to build the BPC, including two knowledge-based criteria: place and manner of articulatory and one data-driven criterion. Moreover, the recognition accuracies of BPCs are much higher than that of phonemes, thus providing more accurate phonetic information to guide the SE process under very noisy conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SE with the BPC information framework can achieve notable performance improvements over the baseline system and an SE system using monophonic information in terms of both speech quality intelligibility on the TIMIT dataset",

    "abstract": "Numerous noise adaptation techniques have been proposed to fine-tune deep-learning models in speech enhancement (SE) for mismatched noise environments. Nevertheless, adaptation to a new environment may lead to catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned environments. The catastrophic forgetting issue degrades the performance of SE in real-world embedded devices, which often revisit previous noise environments. The nature of embedded devices does not allow solving the issue with additional storage of all pre-trained models or earlier training data. In this paper, we propose a regularization-based incremental learning SE (SERIL) strategy, complementing existing noise adaptation strategies without using additional storage. With a regularization constraint, the parameters are updated to the new noise environment while retaining the knowledge of the previous noise environments. The experimental results show that, when faced with a new noise domain, the SERIL model outperforms the unadapted SE model. Meanwhile, compared with the current adaptive technique based on fine-tuning, the SERIL model can reduce the forgetting of previous noise environments by 52%. The results verify that the SERIL model can effectively adjust itself to new noise environments while overcoming the catastrophic forgetting issue. The results make SERIL a favorable choice for real-world SE applications, where the noise environment changes frequently",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a neural speech enhancement method that has a statistical feedback mechanism based on a denoising variational autoencoder (VAE). Deep generative models of speech signals have been combined with unsupervised noise models for enhancing speech robustly regardless of the condition mismatch from the training data. This approach, however, often yields unnatural speech-like noise due to the unsuitable prior distribution on the latent speech representations. To mitigate this problem, we use a denoising VAE whose encoder estimates the latent vectors of clean speech from an input mixture signal. This encoder network is utilized as a prior distribution of the probabilistic generative model of the input mixture, and its condition mismatch is handled in a Bayesian manner. The speech signal is estimated by updating the latent vectors to fit the input mixture while noise is estimated by a nonnegative matrix factorization model. To efficiently train the encoder network, we also propose a multi-task learning of the denoising VAE with the standard mask-based enhancement. The experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing mask-based and generative enhancement methods in unknown conditions",

State-of-the-art speech enhancement methods based on deep neural networks (DNN) commonly learn a single embedding from the noisy input to predict clean speech. This compressed representation inevitably contains both noise and speech information leading to speech distortion and poor noise reduction performance. To alleviate this issue, we proposed to learn from the noisy input separate embeddings for speech and noise and introduced a subspace affinity loss function to prevent information leaking between the two representations. We rigorously proved that minimizing this loss function yields maximally uncorrelated speech and noise representations, which can block information leaking. We empirically showed that our proposed framework outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art speech enhancement methods in various unseen nonstationary noise environments. Our results suggest that learning uncorrelated speech and noise embeddings can improve noise reduction and reduces speech distortion in speech enhancement applications",

    "abstract": "In recent years, speech enhancement (SE) has achieved impressive progress with the success of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the DNN approach usually fails to generalize well to unseen environmental noise that is not included in the training. To address this problem, we propose \"noise tokens\" (NTs), which are a set of neural noise templates that are jointly trained with the SE system. NTs dynamically capture the environment variability and thus enable the DNN model to handle various environments to produce STFT magnitude with higher quality. Experimental results show that using NTs is an effective strategy that consistently improves the generalization ability of SE systems across different DNN architectures. Furthermore, we investigate applying a state-of-the-art neural vocoder to generate waveform instead of traditional inverse STFT (ISTFT). Subjective listening tests show the residual noise can be significantly suppressed through mel-spectrogram correction and vocoder-based waveform synthesis",

In this paper, to capture long-term temporal contexts, we treat speech enhancement as a sequence-to-sequence mapping problem, and propose a noise-aware attention-gated network (NAAGN) for speech enhancement. Firstly, by incorporating deep residual learning and dilated convolutions into U-Net architecture, we present a deep residual U-net (ResUNet), which significantly expand receptive fields to aggregate context information systematically. Secondly, the attention-gated (AG) network is integrated into the ResUNet architecture with minimal computational overhead while furtherly increasing the long-term contexts sensitivity and prediction accuracy. Thirdly, we propose a novel noise-aware multi-task loss function, named weighted mean absolute error (WMAE) loss, in which both speech estimation loss and noise prediction loss are taken into consideration. Finally, the proposed NAAGN model was evaluated on the Voice Bank corpus and DEMAND database, which have been widely applied for speech enhancement by lots of deep learning models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed NAAGN method can achieve a larger segmental SNR improvement, a better speech quality and a higher speech intelligibility than reference methods",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a delayed subband LSTM network for online monaural (single-channel) speech enhancement. The proposed method is developed in the short time Fourier transform (STFT) domain. Online processing requires frame-by-frame signal reception and processing. A paramount feature of the proposed method is that the same LSTM is used across frequencies, which drastically reduces the number of network parameters, the amount of training data and the computational burden. Training is performed in a subband manner: the input consists of a frequency together with a few context frequencies. The network learns a speech-to-noise discriminative function relying on the signal stationarity and on the local spectral pattern, based on which it predicts a clean-speech mask at each frequency. To exploit future information, i.e. a look-ahead strategy, we propose an output-delayed subband LSTM network, which allows the unidirectional forward network to use a few future frames to process the current frame. We leverage the proposed method to participate to the DNS real-time speech enhancement challenge. Experiments with the DNS dataset show that the proposed method achieves better performance-measuring scores than the DNS baseline method, which learns the full-band spectra using a gated recurrent unit network",

Conventional time-frequency (TF) domain methods focus on predicting TF-masks or speech spectrum, via a naive convolution neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN). Some recent studies use complex-valued spectrogram as a training target but train in a real-valued network, predicting the magnitude and phase component or real and imaginary part, respectively. Particularly, convolution recurrent network (CRN) integrates a convolutional encoder-decoder (CED) structure and long short-term memory (LSTM), which has been proven to be helpful for complex targets. In order to train the complex target more effectively, in this paper, we design a new network structure simulating the complex-valued operation, called Deep Complex Convolution Recurrent Network (DCCRN), where both CNN and RNN structures can handle complex-valued operation. The proposed DCCRN models are very competitive over other previous networks, either on objective or subjective metric. With only 3.7M parameters, our DCCRN models submitted to the Interspeech 2020 Deep Noise Suppression (DNS) challenge ranked first for the real-time-track and second for the non-real-time track in terms of Mean Opinion Score (MOS)",

Listeners with bilateral cochlear implants (CIs), however, have poor sensitivity to ITDs which significantly limits their spatial hearing capabilities. Most CI signal processing strategies, such as the continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) strategy, are temporal-envelope-based, and the temporal fine structure (TFS), which contains useful cues for ITDs, is discarded. Recently, a temporal limits encoder (TLE) CI strategy was proposed to implicitly introduce the TFS while preserving the temporal envelope. It has demonstrated benefits in unilateral CI simulations in tasks including speech-in-noise understanding and pitch perception. This study investigates whether the ITD cues could be enhanced by a bilateral TLE strategy. Identification of five ITDs respectively associated with five sound source directions was tested with vocoded speech stimuli to compare the performance of the bilateral TLE and CIS strategies. Results show that the bilateral TLE has better overall performance than the bilateral CIS. This finding suggests that the bilateral TLE is promising in providing enhanced ITD cues for bilateral CI users",

Therefore, research on auditory attention detection based on electroencephalography (EEG) is a possible way to help hearing-impaired listeners detect the focused speech. Many previous studies used linear models or deep learning to decode the attended speech, but the cross-subject decoding accuracy is low, especially within a short time duration. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to simultaneously perform attention decoding and reconstruct the attended temporal amplitude envelopes (TAEs) in a 2s time condition. The experimental results show that, compared to the traditional linear method, both the subject-specific and cross-subject decoding performance showed great improvement. Particularly, the cross-subject decoding accuracy was improved from 56% to 82% in 2s condition in the dichotic listening experiment. Furthermore, it was found that the frontal and temporal regions of the brain were more important for the detection of auditory attention by analyzing the channel contribution map.

Of interest is the increasing performance of Deep Neural Networks in speech applications, but more importantly the fact that they are no longer considered as black boxes. The work carried out here is the first step in a long-term research project, which aims to determine the linguistic units that contribute most to the maintenance or loss of the intelligibility in speech disorders. In this context, we study a CNN trained on normal speech for a classification task of phones and tested on pathological speech. The aim of this first study is to analyze the response of the CNN model to disordered speech in order to study later its effectiveness in providing relevant knowledge in terms of speech severity or loss of intelligibility.

Data augmentation using generative models has been demonstrated to be an effective approach. In this paper, we use a variational autoencoder to augment data at the feature-level as opposed to the speech signal-level. We investigate whether this suits some feature types (e.g., acoustic, linguistic) better than others. We evaluate the approach on IVA recordings of people with four different cognitive impairment conditions. F-scores of a four-way logistic regression (LR) classifier are improved for certain feature types. For a deep neural network (DNN) classifier, the improvement is seen for almost all feature types. The F-score of the LR classifier on the combined features increases from 55% to 60%, and for the DNN classifier from 49% to 62%.

    "abstract": "To facilitate more accessible spoken language technologies and advance the study of dysphonic speech this paper presents UncommonVoice, a freely-available, crowd-sourced speech corpus consisting of 8.5 hours of speech from 57 individuals, 48 of whom have spasmodic dysphonia. The speech material consists of non-words (prolonged vowels, and the prompt for diadochokinetic rate), sentences (randomly selected from TIMIT prompts and the CAPE-V intelligibility analysis), and spontaneous image descriptions. The data was recorded in a crowdsourced manner using a web-based application. This dataset is a fundamental resource for the development of voice-assistive technologies for individuals with dysphonia as well as the enhancement of the accessibility of voice-based technologies (automatic speech recognition, virtual assistants, etc). Research on articulation differences as well as how best to model and represent dysphonic speech will greatly benefit from a free and publicly available dataset of dysphonic speech. The dataset will be made freely and publicly available at www.uncommonvoice.org. In the following sections, we detail the data collection process as well as provide an initial analysis of the speech corpus",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Automatic detection and assessment of voice disorders is important in diagnosis and treatment planning of voice disorders. This work proposes an approach for automatic detection and assessment of voice disorders from a clinical perspective. To accomplish this, a multi-level classification approach was explored in which four binary classifiers were used for the assessment of voice disorders. The binary classifiers were trained using support vector machines with excitation source features, vocal-tract system features, and state-of-art OpenSMILE features. In this study source features namely, glottal parameters obtained from glottal flow waveform, perturbation measures obtained from epoch locations, and cepstral features obtained from linear prediction residual and zero frequency filtered signal were explored. The present study used the Saarbucken voice disorders database to evaluate the performance of proposed approach. The OpenSMILE features namely ComParE and eGEMAPS feature sets shown better performance in terms of classification accuracies of 82.8% and 76%, respectively for voice disorder detection. The combination of excitation source features with baseline feature sets further improved the performance of detection and assessment systems, that highlight the complimentary nature of exciting source features",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One difficult problem of keyword spotting is how to miniaturize its memory footprint while maintain a high precision. Although convolutional neural networks have shown to be effective to the small-footprint keyword spotting problem, they still need hundreds of thousands of parameters to achieve good performance. In this paper, we propose an efficient model based on depthwise separable convolution layers and squeeze-and-excitation blocks. Specifically, we replace the standard convolution by the depthwise separable convolution, which reduces the number of the parameters of the standard convolution without significant performance degradation. We further improve the performance of the depthwise separable convolution by reweighting the output feature maps of the first convolution layer with a so-called squeeze-and-excitation block. We compared the proposed method with five representative models on two experimental settings of the Google Speech Commands dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it achieves a classification error rate of 3.29% with a number of parameters of 72K in the first experiment, which significantly outperforms the comparison methods given a similar model size. It achieves an error rate of 3.97% with a number of parameters of 10K, which is also slightly better than the state-of-the-art comparison method given a similar model size",

The brain-inspired SNN mimic the spike-based information processing of biological neural networks and they can operate on the emerging ultra-low power neuromorphic chips. Unlike conventional artificial neural networks (ANN), SNN process input information asynchronously in an event-driven manner. With temporally sparse input information, this event-driven processing substantially reduces the computational requirements compared to the synchronous computation performed in ANN-based KWS approaches. To explore the effectiveness and computational complexity of SNN on KWS and wakeword detection, we compare the performance and computational costs of spiking fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ANN counterparts under clean and noisy testing conditions. The results obtained on the Speech Commands and Hey Snips corpora have shown the effectiveness of the convolutional SNN model compared to a conventional CNN with comparable performance on KWS and better performance on the wakeword detection task. With its competitive performance and reduced computational complexity, convolutional SNN models running on energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware offer a low-power and effective solution for mobile KWS applications",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The training process of end-to-end keyword spotting (KWS) suffers from critical data imbalance problem that positive samples are far less than negative samples where different negative samples are not of equal importance. During decoding, false alarms are mainly caused by a small number of important negative samples having pronunciation similar to the keyword; however, the training loss is dominated by the majority of negative samples whose pronunciation is not related to the keyword, called unimportant negative samples. This inconsistency greatly degrades the performance of KWS and existing methods like focal loss don't discriminate between the two kinds of negative samples. To deal with the problem, we propose a novel re-weighted interval loss to re-weight sample loss considering the performance of the classifier over local interval of negative utterance, which automatically down-weights the losses of unimportant negative samples and focuses training on important negative samples that are prone to produce false alarms during decoding. Evaluations on Hey Snips dataset demonstrate that our approach has yielded a superior performance over focal loss baseline with 34% (@0.5 false alarm per hour) relative reduction of false reject rate",

Conventional KWS systems based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) decode input speech by ASR before searching for keywords.

Since E2E KWS systems are at the very beginning, the performance is currently not as good as traditional methods, so there is still loads of work to do. To this end, we propose an E2E KWS model consists of four parts, including speech encoder-decoder, query encoder-decoder, attention mechanism and energy scorer. Different from the baseline system using auto-encoder to extract embeddings, the proposed model extracts embeddings that contain character sequence information by encode-decoder. Attention mechanism and a novel energy scorer are also introduced in the model, where the former can locate the keywords, and the latter can make the final decision.

Voice trigger detection is an important speech application, with which users can activate their devices by simply saying a keyword or phrase. Due to privacy and latency reasons, a voice trigger detection system should run on an always-on processor on device. Therefore, having small memory and compute cost is crucial for a voice trigger detection system. Recently, singular value decomposition filters (SVDFs) has been used for end-to-end voice trigger detection. The SVDFs approximate a fully-connected layer with a low rank approximation, which reduces the number of model parameters. In this work, we propose S1DCNN as an alternative approach for end-to-end small-footprint voice trigger detection. An S1DCNN layer consists of a 1D convolution layer followed by a depth-wise 1D convolution layer. We show that the SVDF can be expressed as a special case of the S1DCNN layer. Experimental results show that the S1DCNN achieve 19.0% relative false reject ratio (FRR) reduction with a similar model size and a similar time delay compared to the SVDF. By using longer time delays, the S1DCNN further improve the FRR up to 12.2% relative",

    "abstract": "Many recent source separation systems are designed to separate a fixed number of sources out of a mixture. In the cases where the source activation patterns are unknown, such systems have to either adjust the number of outputs or to identify invalid outputs from the valid ones. Iterative separation methods have gain much attention in the community as they can flexibly decide the number of outputs, however (1) they typically rely on long-term information to determine the stopping time for the iterations, which makes them hard to operate in a causal setting; (2) they lack a \"fault tolerance\" mechanism when the estimated number of sources is different from the actual number. In this paper, we propose a simple training method, the auxiliary autoencoding permutation invariant training (A2PIT), to alleviate the two issues. A2PIT assumes a fixed number of outputs and uses auxiliary autoencoding loss to force the invalid outputs to be the copies of the input mixture, and detects invalid outputs in a fully unsupervised way during inference phase. Experiment results show that A2PIT is able to improve the separation performance across various numbers of speakers and effectively detect the number of speakers in a mixture",

    "abstract": "The dominant speech separation models are based on complex recurrent or convolution neural network that model speech sequences indirectly conditioning on context, such as passing information through many intermediate states in recurrent neural network, leading to suboptimal separation performance. In this paper, we propose a dual-path transformer network (DPTNet) for end-to-end speech separation, which introduces direct context-awareness in the modeling for speech sequences. By introduces a improved transformer, elements in speech sequences can interact directly, which enables DPTNet can model for the speech sequences with direct context-awareness. The improved transformer in our approach learns the order information of the speech sequences without positional encodings by incorporating a recurrent neural network into the original transformer. In addition, the structure of dual paths makes our model efficient for extremely long speech sequence modeling.

    "title": "Multi-Path RNN for Hierarchical Modeling of Long Sequential Data and its Application to Speaker Stream Separation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, the source separation performance was greatly improved by time-domain audio source separation based on dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN). DPRNN is a simple but effective model for a long sequential data. While DPRNN is quite efficient in modeling a sequential data of the length of an utterance, i.e., about 5 to 10 second data, it is harder to apply it to longer sequences such as whole conversations consisting of multiple utterances. It is simply because, in such a case, the number of time steps consumed by its internal module called inter-chunk RNN becomes extremely large. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes a multi-path RNN (MPRNN), a generalized version of DPRNN, that models the input data in a hierarchical manner. In the MPRNN framework, the input data is represented at several (≥3) time-resolutions, each of which is modeled by a specific RNN sub-module. For example, the RNN sub-module that deals with the finest resolution may model temporal relationship only within a phoneme, while the RNN sub-module handling the most coarse resolution may capture only the relationship between utterances such as speaker information. We perform experiments using simulated dialogue-like mixtures and show that MPRNN has greater model capacity, and it outperforms the current state-of-the-art DPRNN framework especially in online processing scenarios",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State-of-the-art under-determined audio source separation systems rely on supervised end to end training of carefully tailored neural network architectures operating either in the time or the spectral domain. However, these methods are severely challenged in terms of requiring access to expensive source level labeled data and being specific to a given set of sources and the mixing process, which demands complete re-training when those assumptions change. This strongly emphasizes the need for unsupervised methods that can leverage the recent advances in data-driven modeling, and compensate for the lack of labeled data through meaningful priors. To this end, we propose a novel approach for audio source separation based on generative priors trained on individual sources. Through the use of projected gradient descent optimization, our approach simultaneously searches in the source-specific latent spaces to effectively recover the constituent sources. Though the generative priors can be defined in the time domain directly, e.g. WaveGAN, we find that using spectral domain loss functions for our optimization leads to good-quality source estimates. Our empirical studies on standard spoken digit and instrument datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over classical as well as state-of-the-art unsupervised baselines",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel supervised Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) speech enhancement method, which is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (NMF-HMM). Our algorithm applies the HMM to capture the timing information, so the temporal dynamics of speech signal can be considered by comparing with the traditional NMF-based speech enhancement method. More specifically, the sum of Poisson, leading to the KL divergence measure, is used as the observation model for each state of HMM. This ensures that the parameter update rule of the proposed algorithm is identical to the multiplicative update rule, which is quick and efficient. In the training stage, this update rule is applied to train the NMF-HMM model. In the online enhancement stage, a novel minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator that combines the NMF-HMM is proposed to conduct speech enhancement. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and short-time objective intelligibility (STOI). The experimental results indicate that the STOI score of proposed strategy is able to outperform 7% than current state-of-the-art NMF-based speech enhancement methods",

This work investigates how to extend dual-path BiLSTM to result in a new state-of-the-art approach, called TasTas, for multi-talker monaural speech separation (a.k.a cocktail party problem). TasTas introduces two simple but effective improvements, one is an iterative multi-stage refinement scheme, and the other is to correct the speech with imperfect separation through a loss of speaker identity consistency between the separated speech and original speech, to boost the performance of dual-path BiLSTM based networks. TasTas takes the mixed utterance of two speakers and maps it to two separated utterances, where each utterance contains only one speaker's voice.

First, we divide the full frequency band into multiple sub-bands and pre-train elite-level sub-band enhancement model (teacher model) for each sub-band. The teacher models are dedicated to processing their own sub-bands. Next, under the teacher models' guidance, we train a general sub-band enhancement model (student model) that works for all sub-bands. Without increasing the number of model parameters and computational complexity, the student model's performance is further improved. To evaluate the proposed method, we conducted a large number of experiments on an open-source data set.

We also construct a whitening filter with its coefficients computed from the estimated noise PSD. It is then applied to the noisy speech, yielding pre-whitened speech for computing the LPCs.

Comparing the low-ranking neurons with short-term or local information, the high-ranking neurons which contain the long-term or global information always update less frequently for a wide range of influence.

In the current paper, we train various DNNs (fully connected, convolutional and recurrent neural networks) for articulatory-to-speech conversion, using rtMRI as input, in a speaker-specific way. We use two male and two female speakers of the USC-TIMIT articulatory database, each of them uttering 460 sentences.

The inputs of the convolutional neural network are ultrasound tongue images. The training target is the 80-dimensional mel-spectrogram, which results in a finer detailed spectral representation than the previously used 25-dimensional Mel-Generalized Cepstrum. From the output of the ultrasound-to-mel-spectrogram prediction, WaveGlow inference results in synthesized speech. We compare the proposed WaveGlow-based system with a continuous vocoder which does not use strict voiced/unvoiced decision when predicting F0. The results demonstrate that during the articulatory-to-acoustic mapping experiments, the WaveGlow neural vocoder produces significantly more natural synthesized speech than the baseline system.

Nevertheless, we are often left with a lot of recordings of spontaneous speech data that have to be transcribed. In this work, for mitigating this speaker sparsity problem, we propose to convert the whole training speech data and make it sound like the test speaker in order to develop a highly accurate ASR system for this speaker. For this purpose, we utilize a CycleGAN-based non-parallel voice conversion technology to forge a labeled training data that is close to the test speaker's speech. We evaluated this speaker adaptation approach on two low-resource corpora, namely, Ainu and Mboshi. We obtained 35–60% relative improvement in phone error rate on the Ainu corpus, and 40% relative improvement was attained on the Mboshi corpus. This approach outperformed two conventional methods namely unsupervised adaptation and multilingual training with these two corpora",

We extend the Sparsespeech model to allow for sampling over a random discrete variable, yielding pseudo-posteriorgrams. The degree of sparsity in this posteriorgram can be fully controlled after the model has been trained. We use the Gumbel-Softmax trick to approximately sample from a discrete distribution in the neural network and this allows us to train the network efficiently with standard backpropagation. The new and improved model is trained and evaluated on the Libri-Light corpus, a benchmark for ASR with limited or no supervision. The model is trained on 600h and 6000h of English read speech. We evaluate the improved model using the ABX error measure and a semi-supervised setting with 10h of transcribed speech. We observe a relative improvement of up to 31.3% on ABX error rates within speakers and 22.5% across speakers with the improved Sparsespeech model on 600h of speech data and further improvements when scaling the model to 6000h",

Audio quality evaluations are usually done in either subjectively or objectively.

The primary downside of the objective approaches primarily is that they lack the human influence factors which are crucial for deriving the subjective perception of quality. However, it cannot be observed directly and manifested in individual brain activity. Thus, we combined predictions from single-subject electroencephalograph (EEG) information and audio features to improve the predictions of the overall quality of synthesized speech.

Firstly, speech perception is studied to inspect the existence of such a state, followed by its identification in speech imagination. Analogous to how voice activity detection is employed to enhance the performance of speech recognition, the EEG state activity detection protocol implemented here is applied to boost the confidence of imagined speech EEG decoding. Classification of speech and NS state is done using two datasets collected from laboratory-based and commercial-based devices. The state sequential information thus obtained is further utilized to reduce the search space of imagined EEG unit recognition.

    "abstract": "Direct synthesis from intracranial brain activity into acoustic speech might provide an intuitive and natural communication means for speech-impaired users. In previous studies we have used logarithmic Mel-scaled speech spectrograms (logMels) as an intermediate representation in the decoding from ElectroCorticoGraphic (ECoG) recordings to an audible waveform. Mel-scaled speech spectrograms have a long tradition in acoustic speech processing and speech synthesis applications. In the past, we relied on regression approaches to find a mapping from brain activity to logMel spectral coefficients, due to the continuous feature space. However, regression tasks are unbounded and thus neuronal fluctuations in brain activity may result in abnormally high amplitudes in a synthesized acoustic speech signal. To mitigate these issues, we propose two methods for quantization of power values to discretize the feature space of logarithmic Mel-scaled spectral coefficients by using the median and the logistic formula, respectively, to reduce the complexity and restricting the number of intervals. We evaluate the practicability in a proof-of-concept with one participant through a simple classification based on linear discriminant analysis and compare the resulting waveform with the original speech. Reconstructed spectrograms achieve Pearson correlation coefficients with a mean of r=0.5 ± 0.11 in a 5-fold cross validation",

Recent research has progressed towards neural speech decoding paradigms that have the potential for normal communication rates. Yet, current neural decoding research is limited to typical speakers and the extent to which these studies can be translated to a target population (e.g., ALS) is still unexplored. Here, we investigated the decoding of imagined and spoken phrases from non-invasive magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals of ALS subjects using several spectral features (band-power of brainwaves: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies) with seven machine learning decoders (Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, ensemble, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and artificial neural network). Experimental results indicated that the decoding performance for ALS patients is lower than healthy subjects yet significantly higher than chance level. The best performances were 75% for decoding five imagined phrases and 88% for five spoken phrases from ALS patients.

We also explore other training strategies such as multi-task learning with listen-attend-spell (LAS), label smoothing via probabilistic modelling of silence and use of multiple pronunciations, and show how they can be combined with the proposed initialization technique. In addition, we show the connection between cost function of proposed discriminative initialization technique and minimum word error rate (MWER) criterion. We evaluate our methods on two E2E ASR systems, a phone-based system and a word-piece based system, trained on 6500 hours of Alexa's Indian English speech corpus.

Instead of having multiple output layers as with the permutation invariant training (PIT), SOT uses a model with only one output layer that generates the transcriptions of multiple speakers one after another. The attention and decoder modules take care of producing multiple transcriptions from overlapped speech. SOT has two advantages over PIT: (1) no limitation in the maximum number of speakers, and (2) an ability to model the dependencies among outputs for different speakers. We also propose a simple trick that allows SOT to be executed in O(S), where S is the number of the speakers in the training sample, by using the start times of the constituent source utterances. Experimental results on LibriSpeech corpus show that the SOT models can transcribe overlapped speech with variable numbers of speakers significantly better than PIT-based models.

Unlike previous work on this topic, which performs on-the-fly limited-size beam-search decoding and generates alignment scores for expected edit-distance computation, in our proposed method, we re-calculate and sum scores of all the possible alignments for each hypothesis in N-best lists. The hypothesis probability scores and back-propagated gradients are calculated efficiently using the forward-backward algorithm. Moreover, the proposed method allows us to decouple the decoding and training processes, and thus we can perform offline parallel-decoding and MWER training for each subset iteratively. Experimental results show that this proposed semi-on-the-fly method can speed up the on-the-fly method by 6 times and result in a similar WER improvement (3.6%) over a baseline RNN-T model. The proposed MWER training can also effectively reduce high-deletion errors (9.2% WER-reduction) introduced by RNN-T models when EOS is added for end-pointer. Further improvement can be achieved if we use a proposed RNN-T rescoring method to re-rank hypotheses and use external RNN-LM to perform additional rescoring.

Generally, it is essential to prepare speech-to-text paired data to construct end-to-end ASR models, but it is difficult to collect a large amount of such data in practice. One issue caused by data scarcity is that the performance of ASR on out-of-domain tasks different from those using the speech-to-text paired data is poor, since the mapping from the speech information to textual information is not well learned. To address this problem, we leverage a large number of phoneme-to-grapheme (P2G) paired data, which can be easily created from external texts and a rich pronunciation dictionary. The P2G conversion and end-to-end ASR are regarded as similar transformation tasks where the input phonetic information is converted into textual information. Our method utilizes the P2G conversion task for pre-training of a decoder network in Transformer encoder-decoder based end-to-end ASR.

While postfiltering is effective in reducing coding artifacts, such methods often involve processing in both the encoder and the decoder, rely on additional transmitted side information, or are highly dependent on other codec functions for optimal performance. We propose a low-complexity postfiltering method to improve the harmonic structure of the decoded signal, which models the fundamental frequency of the signal. In contrast to past approaches, the postfilter operates at the decoder as a standalone function and does not need the transmission of additional side information. It can thus be used to enhance the output of any codec. We tested the approach on a modified version of the EVS codec in TCX mode only, which is subject to more pronounced coding artefacts when used at its lowest bitrate. Listening test results show an average improvement of 7 MUSHRA points for decoded signals with the proposed harmonic postfilter ",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Biophysically realistic models of the cochlea are based on cascaded transmission-line (TL) models which capture longitudinal coupling, cochlear nonlinearities, as well as the human frequency selectivity. However, these models are slow to compute (order of seconds/minutes) while machine-hearing and hearing-aid applications require a real-time solution. Consequently, real-time applications often adopt more basic and less time-consuming descriptions of cochlear processing (gamma-tone, dual resonance nonlinear) even though there are clear advantages in using more biophysically correct models. To overcome this, we recently combined nonlinear Deep Neural Networks (DNN) with analytical TL cochlear model descriptions to build a real-time model of cochlear processing which captures the biophysical properties associated with the TL model. In this work, we aim to extend the normal-hearing DNN-based cochlear model (CoNNear) to simulate frequency-specific patterns of hearing sensitivity loss, yielding a set of normal and hearing-impaired auditory models which can be computed in real-time and are differentiable. They can hence be used in backpropagation networks to develop the next generation of hearing-aid and machine hearing applications",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The voice mode of the Opus audio coder can compress wideband speech at bit rates ranging from 6 kb/s to 40 kb/s. However, Opus is at its core a waveform matching coder, and as the rate drops below 10 kb/s, quality degrades quickly. As the rate reduces even further, parametric coders tend to perform better than waveform coders. In this paper we propose a backward-compatible way of improving low bit rate Opus quality by resynthesizing speech from the decoded parameters. We compare two different neural generative models, WaveNet and LPCNet. WaveNet is a powerful, high-complexity, and high-latency architecture that is not feasible for a practical system, yet provides a best known achievable quality with generative models. LPCNet is a low-complexity, low-latency RNN-based generative model, and practically implementable on mobile phones. We apply these systems with parameters from Opus coded at 6 kb/s as conditioning features for the generative models. A listening test shows that for the same 6 kb/s Opus bit stream, synthesized speech using LPCNet clearly outperforms the output of the standard Opus decoder. This opens up ways to improve the decoding quality of existing speech and audio waveform coders without breaking compatibility",

    "abstract": "Many audio processing tasks require perceptual assessment. The \"gold standard\" of obtaining human judgments is time-consuming, expensive, and cannot be used as an optimization criterion. On the other hand, automated metrics are efficient to compute but often correlate poorly with human judgment, particularly for audio differences at the threshold of human detection. In this work, we construct a metric by fitting a deep neural network to a new large dataset of crowdsourced human judgments. Subjects are prompted to answer a straightforward, objective question: are two recordings identical or not? These pairs are algorithmically generated under a variety of perturbations, including noise, reverb, and compression artifacts; the perturbation space is probed with the goal of efficiently identifying the just-noticeable difference (JND) level of the subject. We show that the resulting learned metric is well-calibrated with human judgments, outperforming baseline methods. Since it is a deep network, the metric is differentiable, making it suitable as a loss function for other tasks. Thus, simply replacing an existing loss (e.g., deep feature loss) with our metric yields significant improvement in a denoising network, as measured by subjective pairwise comparison",

    "abstract": "Classic public switched telephone networks (PSTN) are often a black box for VoIP network providers, as they have no access to performance indicators, such as delay or packet loss. Only the degraded output speech signal can be used to monitor the speech quality of these networks. However, the current state-of-the-art speech quality models are not reliable enough to be used for live monitoring. One of the reasons for this is that PSTN distortions can be unique depending on the provider and country, which makes it difficult to train a model that generalizes well for different PSTN networks. In this paper, we present a new open-source PSTN speech quality test set with over 1000 crowdsourced real phone calls.

We propose a novel transfer learning framework to obtain reliable articulatory information in such cases. We demonstrate its reliability both in terms of estimating parameters of speech production and its ability to enhance the accuracy of an end-to-end phone recognizer. Articulatory information is estimated from speaker independent phonemic features, using a small speech corpus, with electro-magnetic articulography (EMA) measurements. Next, we employ a teacher-student model to learn estimation of articulatory features from acoustic features for the targeted phone recognition task. Phone recognition experiments, demonstrate that the proposed transfer learning approach outperforms the baseline transfer learning system acquired directly from an acoustic-to-articulatory (AAI) model. The articulatory features estimated by the proposed method, in conjunction with acoustic features, improved the phone error rate (PER) by 6.7% and 6% on the TIMIT core test and development sets, respectively, compared to standalone static acoustic features. Interestingly, this improvement is slightly higher than what is obtained by static+dynamic acoustic features, but with a significantly less. Adding articulatory features on top of static+dynamic acoustic features yields a small but positive PER improvement",

The learned features maps are then combined and processed by a recurrent block with bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM) gates for preserving the smoothly varying nature of the articulatory trajectories. Our experimental evidence shows that, on a speaker dependent AAI task, in spite of the reduced number of parameters, our model demonstrates better root mean squared error (RMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) than a both a BLSTM model and an FC-BLSTM model where the first stages are fully connected layers. In particular, the average RMSE goes from 1.401 when feeding the filterbank features directly into the BLSTM, to 1.328 with the FC-BLSTM model, and to 1.216 with the proposed method. Similarly, the average PCC increases from 0.859 to 0.877, and 0.895, respectively. On a speaker independent AAI task, we show that our convolutional features outperform the original filterbank features, and can be combined with phonetic features bringing independent information to the solution of the problem.

Then, the difference between the subspaces is used as a discriminative space, providing discriminative features.

A convolutional dense neural network (CDNN) is used to estimate the speech rate from the learned representations. In practice, articulatory data is not directly available; thus, we use Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion (AAI) to derive the articulatory representations from acoustics. However, these pseudo-articulatory representations are also generic and not optimized for any task. To learn the speech-rate specific pseudo-articulatory representations, we propose a joint training of BLSTM-based AAI and CDNN using a weighted loss function that considers the losses corresponding to speech rate estimation and articulatory prediction. The proposed model yields an improvement in speech rate estimation by ~18.5% in terms of pearson correlation coefficient (CC) compared to the baseline CDNN model with generic articulatory representations as inputs. To utilize complementary information from articulatory features, we further perform experiments by concatenating task-specific acoustic and pseudo-articulatory representations, which yield an improvement in CC by ~2.5% compared to the baseline CDNN model",

Previous studies investigating prosodic irregularities in dysarthria tend to focus on pitch or voice quality measurements. Rhythm is another aspect of prosody which refers to the rhythmic division of speech units into relatively equal time. Speakers with dysarthria tend to have irregular rhythmic patterns that could be useful for detecting dysarthria. We compare the classification accuracy between solely using standard prosodic features against using both standard prosodic features and rhythm-based features, using random forest, support vector machine, and feed-forward neural network. Our best performing classifiers achieved a relative percentage increase of 7.5% and 15% in detection and severity assessment respectively for the QoLT Korean dataset, while the TORGO English dataset had an increase of 4.1% and 3.2%.

In the past, affine transformation and DNN have been used to transform articulatory movements from neutral to fast(N2F) and neutral to slow(N2S) speaking rates [1]. In this work, we improve over the existing transformation techniques by modeling rate specific durations and their transformation using AstNet, an encoder-decoder framework with attention. In the current work, we propose an encoder-decoder architecture using LSTMs which generates smoother predicted articulatory trajectories. For modeling duration variations across speaking rates, we deploy attention network, which eliminates the need to align trajectories in different rates using DTW. We perform a phoneme specific duration analysis to examine how well duration is transformed using the proposed AstNet. As the range of articulatory motions is correlated with speaking rate, we also analyze amplitude of the transformed articulatory movements at different rates compared to their original counterparts, to examine how well the proposed AstNet predicts the extent of articulatory movements in N2F and N2S.We observe that AstNet could model both duration and extent of articulatory movements better than the existing transformation techniques resulting in more accurate transformed articulatory trajectories",

However, building a good bilingual or code-switched TTS for a particular voice is still a challenge. The main reason is that it is not easy to obtain a bilingual corpus from a speaker who achieves native-level fluency in both languages. In this paper, we explore the use of Mandarin speech recordings from a Mandarin speaker, and English speech recordings from another English speaker to build high-quality bilingual and code-switched TTS for both speakers. A Tacotron2-based cross-lingual voice conversion system is employed to generate the Mandarin speaker's English speech and the English speaker's Mandarin speech, which show good naturalness and speaker similarity. The obtained bilingual data are then augmented with code-switched utterances synthesized using a Transformer model. With these data, three neural TTS models — Tacotron2, Transformer and FastSpeech are applied for building bilingual and code-switched TTS.

To support online enrollment of new speakers, we condition the Tacotron-based synthesizer on speaker embeddings derived from a pre-trained x-vector speaker encoder by transfer learning. We introduce a shared phoneme set to encourage more phoneme sharing compared with the IPA. Our MOS results demonstrate that the native speech in all languages is highly intelligible and natural.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most of current end-to-end speech synthesis assumes the input text is in a single language situation. However, code-switching in speech occurs frequently in routine life, in which speakers switch between languages in the same utterance. And building a large mixed-language speech database is difficult and uneconomical. In this paper, both windowing technique and style token modeling are designed for the code-switching end-to-end speech synthesis. To improve the consistency of speaking style in bilingual situation, compared with the conventional windowing techniques that used fixed constraints, the dynamic attention reweighting soft windowing mechanism is proposed to ensure the smooth transition of code-switching. To compensate the shortage of mixed-language training data, the language dependent style token is designed for the cross-language multi-speaker acoustic modeling, where both the Mandarin and English monolingual data are the extended training data set. The attention gating is proposed to adjust style token dynamically based on the language and the attended context information. Experimental results show that proposed methods lead to an improvement on intelligibility, naturalness and similarity",

    "abstract": "Code-switching — the intra-utterance use of multiple languages — is prevalent across the world. Within text-to-speech (TTS), multilingual models have been found to enable code-switching [1–3]. By modifying the linguistic input to sequence-to-sequence TTS, we show that code-switching is possible for languages unseen during training, even within monolingual models. We use a small set of phonological features derived from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), such as vowel height and frontness, consonant place and manner. This allows the model topology to stay unchanged for different languages, and enables new, previously unseen feature combinations to be interpreted by the model. We show that this allows us to generate intelligible, code-switched speech in a new language at test time, including the approximation of sounds never seen in training",

Previous works are able to model speaker individuality in speaker space via speaker encoder but suffer from performance decreasing when synthesizing cross-lingual speech. This is because the speaker space formed by all speaker embeddings is completely language-dependent. In order to construct a language-independent speaker space, we regard cross-lingual speech synthesis as a domain adaptation problem and propose a training method to let the speaker encoder adapt speaker embedding of different languages into the same space. Furthermore, to improve speaker individuality and construct a human-interpretable speaker space, we propose a regression method to construct perceptually correlated speaker space. Experimental result demonstrates that our method could not only improve the performance of both cross-lingual and intra-lingual speech but also find perceptually similar speakers beyond languages",

    "abstract": "Regional entities often occur in a code-mixed text in the non-native roman script and synthesizing them with the correct pronunciation and accent is a challenging problem. English grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) rules fail for such entities because of the orthographical mistakes and phonological differences between the English and regional languages. The traditional approach for this problem involves language identification, followed by the transliteration of the regional entities to their native language and then passing them through a native G2P. In this work, we simplify this module based architecture by learning an end-to-end mixlingual G2P in a multi-task type setting. Also, rather than mapping the output phone sequences from our mixlingual G2P to the English phoneset or using the \"shared\" phoneset, we use the polyglot data and \"separated\" phoneset to train a mixlingual synthesizer to improvise the synthesized voice accent for regional entities. We have used Hindi-English as the code-mix scenario and we show absolute incremental gains of up to 28% in pronunciation accuracy and a 0.9 gain in \"overall impression\" mean-opinion-score (MOS) over using a standard English monolingual text-to-speech (TTS)",

    "abstract": "Building text-to-speech (TTS) synthesisers for Indian languages is a difficult task owing to a large number of active languages. Indian languages can be classified into a finite set of families, prominent among them, Indo-Aryan and Dravidian. The proposed work exploits this property to build a generic TTS system using multiple languages from the same family in an end-to-end framework. Generic systems are quite robust as they are capable of capturing a variety of phonotactics across languages. These systems are then adapted to a new language in the same family using small amounts of adaptation data. Experiments indicate that good quality TTS systems can be built using only 7 minutes of adaptation data. An average degradation mean opinion score of 3.98 is obtained for the adapted TTSes Extensive analysis of systematic interactions between languages in the generic TTSes is carried out. x-vectors are included as speaker embedding to synthesise text in a particular speaker's voice. An interesting observation is that the prosody of the target speaker's voice is preserved. These results are quite promising as they indicate the capability of generic TTSes to handle speaker and language switching seamlessly, along with the ease of adaptation to a new language",

However, these models typically require large amounts of training data, which can make it costly to produce a new voice with the desired quality. Although multi-speaker modeling can reduce the data requirements necessary for a new voice, this approach is usually not viable for many low-resource languages for which abundant multi-speaker data is not available. In this paper, we therefore investigated to what extent multilingual multi-speaker modeling can be an alternative to monolingual multi-speaker modeling, and explored how data from foreign languages may best be combined with low-resource language data. We found that multilingual modeling can increase the naturalness of low-resource language speech, showed that multilingual models can produce speech with a naturalness comparable to monolingual multi-speaker models, and saw that the target language naturalness was affected by the strategy used to add foreign language data",

Specifically, we use a Prototypical Networks and train it with a support set of long utterances and a query set of short utterances of varying lengths. Further, since optimizing only for the classes in the given episode may be insufficient for learning discriminative embeddings for unseen classes, we additionally enforce the model to classify both the support and the query set against the entire set of classes in the training set. By combining these two learning schemes, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art speaker verification models learned with a standard supervised learning framework on short utterance (1-2 seconds) on the VoxCeleb datasets.

Speech streams are segmented into fragments. The frame-level encoder with attention learns features and highlights the target related frames locally, and output a fragment based embedding. The segment-level encoder works with a second attention layer to emphasize the fragments probably related to target speakers. The global information is finally collected from segment-level module to predict speakers via a classifier. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, artificial datasets based on Switchboard Cellular part1 (SWBC) and Voxceleb1 are constructed in two conditions, where speakers' voices are overlapped and not overlapped. Comparing to two baselines the obtained results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performances. Moreover, further experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of utterance segmentation. The results show that a reasonable segmentation can slightly improve identification performances",

The effect of training data set size in the performance of both single- and multi-task models is investigated as well as the specific contribution of nativeness and sex information to speaker recognition. Experimental results show that multi-task (MTL) models outperform single task models.

The client samples are selected within one database according to highest cosine scores with the anchor in i-vector space. The impostor samples are selected in the same way but from another database. Our double-branch siamese performs binary classification using cross entropy loss during training. In testing phase, we obtain speaker verification scores directly from its output layer. Whereas, our triple-branch siamese is trained to learn speaker embeddings using triplet loss. During testing, we extract speaker embeddings from its output layer, which are scored in the experiments using cosine scoring.

Existing methods mainly focus on designing frame-level feature extraction structures, utterance-level aggregation methods and loss functions to learn discriminative speaker embeddings. The scores of verification trials are then computed using cosine distance or Probabilistic Linear Discriminative Analysis (PLDA) classifiers. This paper proposes an effective speaker recognition method which is based on joint identification and verification supervisions, inspired by multi-task learning frameworks. Specifically, a deep architecture with convolutional feature extractor, attentive pooling and two classifier branches is presented. The first, an identification branch, is trained with additive margin softmax loss (AM-Softmax) to classify the speaker identities. The second, a verification branch, trains a discriminator with binary cross entropy loss (BCE) to optimize a new triplet-based mutual information. To balance the two losses during different training stages, a ramp-up/ramp-down weighting scheme is employed. Furthermore, an attentive bilinear pooling method is proposed to improve the effectiveness of embeddings. Extensive experiments have been conducted on VoxCeleb1 to evaluate the proposed method, demonstrating results that relatively reduce the equal error rate (EER) by 22% compared to the baseline system using identification supervision only",

Traditional approaches normally focus on scoring of sentences, words or mispronunciation detection of phonemes independently without considering the hierarchical and contextual relationships among them. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical network which combines scoring at the granularity of phoneme, word and sentence jointly. Specifically, we achieve the phoneme scores by a semi-supervised phoneme mispronunciation detection method, the words scores by an attention mechanism, and the sentence scores by a non-linear regression method. To further model the correlation between the sentence and phoneme, we optimize the network by a multitask learning framework (MTL). The proposed framework relies on a few sentence-level labeled data and a majority of unlabeled data. We evaluate the network performance on a multi-granular dataset consisting of sentences, words and phonemes which was recorded by 1,000 Chinese speakers and labeled by three experts. Experimental results show that the proposed method is well correlated with human raters with a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.88 at sentence level and 0.77 at word level.

In response, we first present a novel use of hybrid CTC-Attention approach to the MD task, taking advantage of the strengths of both CTC and the attention-based model meanwhile getting around the need for phone-level forced-alignment. Second, we perform input augmentation with text prompt information to make the resulting E2E model more tailored for the MD task. On the other hand, we adopt two MD decision methods so as to better cooperate with the proposed framework: 1) decision-making based on a recognition confidence measure or 2) simply based on speech recognition results. A series of Mandarin MD experiments demonstrate that our approach not only simplifies the processing pipeline of existing hybrid DNN-HMM systems but also brings about systematic and substantial performance improvements. Furthermore, input augmentation with text prompts seems to hold excellent promise for the E2E-based MD approach",

Most of the existing MDD approaches focus on dealing with categorical errors (viz. one canonical phone is substituted by another one, aside from those mispronunciations caused by deletions or insertions). However, accurate detection and diagnosis of non-categorial or distortion errors (viz. approximating L2 phones with L1 (first-language) phones, or erroneous pronunciations in between) still seems out of reach. In view of this, we propose to conduct MDD with a novel end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-based ASR) approach. In particular, we expand the original L2 phone set with their corresponding anti-phone set, making the E2E-based MDD approach have a better capability to take in both categorical and non-categorial mispronunciations, aiming to provide better mispronunciation detection and diagnosis feedback. Furthermore, a novel transfer-learning paradigm is devised to obtain the initial model estimate of the E2E-based MDD system without resource to any phonological rules.

    "abstract": "Pronunciation erroneous tendencies (PETs) are designed to provide instructive feedback to guide non-native language learners to correct their pronunciation errors in language learning thus PET detection plays an important role in computer-aided pronunciation training (CAPT) system. However, PET detection suffers data sparsity problem because non-native data collection and annotation are time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning framework based on contrastive predictive coding (CPC) to extract knowledge from a large scale of unlabeled speech from two native languages, and then transfer this knowledge to the PET detection task. In this framework, language adversarial training is incorporated to guide the model to align the feature distribution between two languages. In addition, sinc filter is introduced to extract formant-like feature that is considered relevant to some kinds of pronunciation errors. Through the experiment on the Japanese part of BLCU inter-Chinese speech corpus, results show that our proposed language adversarial represent learning is effective to improve the performance of pronunciation erroneous tendency detection for non-native language learners",

The tasks of error detection and error tendency diagnosis become particularly challenging when the speech in question is spontaneous and particularly given the challenges posed by the inconsistency of human annotation of pronunciation errors. This paper presents an approach to these tasks by distinguishing between lexical errors, wherein the speaker does not know how a particular word is pronounced, and accent errors, wherein the candidate's speech exhibits consistent patterns of phone substitution, deletion and insertion. Three annotated corpora of non-native English speech by speakers of multiple L1s are analysed, the consistency of human annotation investigated and a method presented for detecting individual accent and lexical errors and diagnosing accent error tendencies at the speaker level",

    "abstract": "Mispronunciation detection is an essential component of the Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems. State-of-the-art mispronunciation detection models use Deep Neural Networks (DNN) for acoustic modeling, and a Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP) based algorithm for pronunciation scoring. However, GOP based scoring models have two major limitations: i.e., (i) They depend on forced alignment which splits the speech into phonetic segments and independently use them for scoring, which neglects the transitions between phonemes within the segment; (ii) They only focus on phonetic segments, which fails to consider the context effects across phonemes (such as liaison, omission, incomplete plosive sound, etc.). In this work, we propose the Context-aware Goodness of Pronunciation (CaGOP) scoring model. Particularly, two factors namely the transition factor and the duration factor are injected into CaGOP scoring. The transition factor identifies the transitions between phonemes and applies them to weight the frame-wise GOP. Moreover, a self-attention based phonetic duration modeling is proposed to introduce the duration factor into the scoring model. The proposed scoring model significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 20% and 12% relative improvement over the GOP model on the phoneme-level and sentence-level mispronunciation detection respectively",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper proposed a procedure for detecting and recognizing mispronunciations in training data, and improved non-native acoustic modeling by training with the corrected phone alignments. To start, an initial phone sequence for an utterance is derived from its word-level transcription and a dictionary of canonical pronunciation. Following that, the region of mispronunciation is detected through examining phone-level goodness-of-pronunciation (GOP) scores. Then over the region, a constrained phone decoder is used to recognize the most likely pronounced phone sequence from all the possible phone sequences with one phone edit distance from the initial phone sequence. After updating the phone alignments and GOP scores, this detection and recognition procedure is repeated until no more mispronunciation is detected. Experiments on a 300-hour non-native spontaneous dataset showed that the acoustic model trained from the proposed procedure reduced WER by 6% compared to a well optimized context-dependent factorized-TDNN HMM baseline system with the same neural network topology. This work also offered a data-driven approach for generating a list of common mispronunciation patterns of non-native English learners that may be useful for speech assessment purpose",

In this paper, we present our approach to designing an open-source neural network to classify audio segments into vocalizations produced by the child wearing the recording device, vocalizations produced by other children, adult male speech, and adult female speech. To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora which sums up to a total of 260 hours of recordings and covers 10 languages. Our model can be used as input for downstream tasks such as estimating the number of words produced by adult speakers, or the number of linguistic units produced by children.

The basic idea is that mixed speech can be projected into an embedding space using neural networks where embedding vectors are orthogonal for different speakers while parallel for the same speaker. Therefore, speaker count estimation can be performed by computing the rank of the mean covariance matrix of the embedding vectors. It is also a feature combination method in speaker embedding space instead of simply combining features at the input layer of neural networks. Experimental results show that embedding-based method is better than classification-based method where the network directly predicts the count of speakers and spatial features help to speaker count estimation. In addition, the features combined in the embedding space can achieve more accurate speaker counting than features combined at the input layer of neural networks when tested on anechoic and reverberant datasets",

In addition, an acoustic model trained to recognize speech as well as sound events could leverage multi-task learning to alleviate data scarcity problems in individual tasks. In this work, an all-in-one (AIO) acoustic model based on the Transformer architecture is trained to solve ASR, AT, and AED tasks simultaneously, where model parameters are shared across all tasks. For the ASR and AED tasks, the Transformer model is combined with the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) objective to enforce a monotonic ordering and to utilize timing information.

We approach SCP by using speech-related biosignals stemming from facial muscle activities captured by surface electromyography (EMG). To demonstrate the feasibility of SCP, we select one speaker trait (speaker identity) and one speaker state (speaking mode). We introduce two promising strategies for SCP: (1) deriving paralinguistic speaker information directly from EMG of silently produced speech versus (2) first converting EMG into an audible speech signal followed by conventional computational paralinguistic methods.

In practice, however, it would be beneficial to process much shorter speech segments. With the traditional workflow of paralinguistic speech processing, this would require properly annotated training and testing material consisting of short clips. In this study we show that Support Vector Regression machine learning models using Fisher vectors as features, even when trained on longer utterances, allow us to efficiently and accurately detect conflict intensity from very short audio segments. Even without having reliable annotations of these such short chunks, the mean scores of the predictions corresponding to short segments of the same original, longer utterances correlate well to the reference manual annotation. We also verify the validity of this approach by comparing the SVM predictions of the chunks with a manual annotation for the full and the 5-second-long cases. Our findings allow the construction of conflict detection systems having smaller delay, therefore being more useful in practice",

Several acoustic features computed at different time scales are evaluated via a trained classifier for the prediction of the subjective ratings. Features based on pausing, pitch and speech rate are found to be important predictors of perceived confidence. Also it is seen that the ratings are influenced by signal properties computed across the utterance. When trained on recordings with strong rater agreement, the system predicts low confidence readers with an F-score of 0.70",

    "title": "Towards a Comprehensive Assessment of Speech Intelligibility for Pathological Speech",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech intelligibility is an essential though complex construct in speech pathology. It is affected by multiple contextual variables and it is often measured in different ways. In this paper, we evaluate various measures of speech intelligibility based on orthographic transcriptions, with respect to their reliability and validity. For this study, different speech tasks were analyzed together with their respective perceptual ratings assigned by five experienced speech-language pathologists: a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and two types of orthographic transcriptions, one in terms of existing words and the other in terms of perceived segments, including nonsense words. Six subword measures concerning graphemes and phonemes were derived automatically from these transcriptions. All measures exhibit high degrees of reliability. Correlations between the six subword measures and three independent measures, VAS, word accuracy, and severity level, reveal that the measures extracted automatically from the orthographic transcriptions are valid predictors of speech intelligibility. The results also indicate differences between the speech tasks, suggesting that a comprehensive assessment of speech intelligibility requires materials from different speech tasks in combination with measures at different granularity levels: utterance, word, and subword. We discuss these results in relation to those of previous research and suggest possible avenues for future research",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Communication channels and actor's gender have been increasingly reported to influence emotion perception, but past literature exploring these two factors has largely been disassociated. The present study examined how emotions expressed by actors of the two genders are perceived in three different sensory channels (i.e. face, prosody, and semantics). Eighty-eight native Mandarin participants (43 females and 45 males) were asked to identify the emotion displayed visually through face, or auditorily through prosody or semantics in a fixed-choice format, in which accuracy and reaction time were recorded. Results revealed that visual facial expressions were more accurately and rapidly identified, particularly when posed by female actors. Additionally, emotion perception in the auditory modality was modulated by actor's gender to a greater extent: emotional prosody yielded more accurate and faster responses when expressed by female than male actors, while emotional semantics produced better performances when presented by males. To sum up, paralinguistic (i.e., visual and prosodic) dominance effects are more evident in emotions expressed by female than male actors",

These models can generate near-human speech with a large accurately-transcribed speech corpus. However, preparing such a large data-set is both expensive and laborious. To alleviate the problem of heavy data demand, we propose a novel unsupervised pre-training mechanism in this paper. Specifically, we first use Vector-quantization Variational-Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to extract the unsupervised linguistic units from large-scale, publicly found, and untranscribed speech. We then pre-train the sequence-to-sequence TTS model by using the <unsupervised linguistic units, audio> pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the model with a small amount of <text, audio> paired data from the target speaker. As a result, both objective and subjective evaluations show that our proposed method can synthesize more intelligible and natural speech with the same amount of paired training data. Besides, we extend our proposed method to the hypothesized low-resource languages and verify the effectiveness of the method using objective evaluation",

Although the multilingual model exhibits the transfer learning ability to benefit the low-resource languages, data imbalance still undermines the model performance. A data balance training strategy is successfully applied and effectively improves the voice quality of the low-resource languages.

This is accomplished by introducing a two-stage network, where the first stage is trained to output EMA sequences that are averaged across all speakers on a per-triphone basis (and so are speaker-independent) and the second receives these as input for mel-cepstrum estimation. Experimental results show that using the d-vectors can improve the performance of mel-cepstrum estimation by 0.19 dB with regard to mel-cepstrum distortion in the closed-speaker test set. Additionally, giving triphone-averaged EMA data to a mel-cepstrum estimator is shown to improve the performance by a further 0.16 dB, which indicates that the speaker-independent input has a positive effect on mel-cepstrum estimation",

These deep learning algorithms, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and its memory enhanced variations, have shown strong reconstruction ability from input linguistic features to acoustic features. However, the efficiency of these algorithms is limited for its sequential process in both training and inference. Recently, Transformer with superiority in parallelism is proposed to TTS. It employs the positional embedding instead of recurrent mechanism for position modeling and significantly boosts training speed. However, this approach lacks monotonic constraint and is deficient with issues like pronunciation skipping. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a monotonicity enhancing approach with the combining use of Stepwise Monotonic Attention (SMA) and multi-head attention for Transformer based TTS system.

However, the order of this sequence of interleaved actions varies across sentences, which raises the question of how the actions should be chosen. We propose a reinforcement learning based framework to train an agent to make this decision. We compare our performance against that of deterministic, rule-based systems.

The ‘finder' is an adversary used to train the ‘hider', attempting to detect the value of the control parameter from the hidden embedding. The ‘combiner' network recombines the hidden embedding with a desired new value of the control parameter. The input and output to the system are mel-spectrograms and we employ a neural vocoder to generate the output speech waveform. As a proof of concept, we use F as the control parameter. The system was evaluated in terms of control parameter accuracy and naturalness against a high quality signal processing method of F modification that also works in the spectrogram domain.

    "abstract": "Speaker recognition has seen impressive advances with the advent of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, state-of-the-art speaker recognition systems still rely on human engineering features such as mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). We believe that the handcrafted features limit the potential of the powerful representation of DNNs. Besides, there are also additional steps such as voice activity detection (VAD) and cepstral mean and variance normalization (CMVN) after computing the MFCC. In this paper, we show that MFCC, VAD, and CMVN can be replaced by the tools available in the standard deep learning toolboxes, such as a stacked of stride convolutions, temporal gating, and instance normalization. With these tools, we show that directly learning speaker embeddings from waveforms outperforms an x-vector network that uses MFCC or filter-bank output as features. We achieve an EER of 1.95% on the VoxCeleb1 test set using an end-to-end training scheme, which, to our best knowledge, is the best performance reported using raw waveforms. What's more, the proposed method is complementary with x-vector systems. The fusion of the proposed method with x-vectors trained on filter-bank features produce an EER of 1.55%",

We also introduce an identity change loss criterion which utilizes a reconstruction error to different utterances spoken by the same speaker. Since the proposed criteria reduce the variation of speaker characteristics caused by changes in background environment or spoken content, the resulting embeddings of each speaker become more consistent.

The widely used pairwise loss functions only consider the discrimination within a mini-batch data (short-term), while either the speaker identity information or the whole training dataset is not fully exploited. Thus, these pairwise comparisons may suffer from the interferences and variances brought by speaker-unrelated factors. To tackle this problem, we introduce the speaker identity information to form long-term speaker embedding centroids, which are determined by all the speakers in the training set. During the training process, each centroid dynamically accumulates the statistics of all samples belonging to a specific speaker. Since the long-term speaker embedding centroids are associated with a wide range of training samples, these centroids have the potential to be more robust and discriminative. Finally, these centroids are employed to construct a loss function, named long short term speaker loss (LSTSL). The proposed LSTSL constrains that the distances between samples and centroid from the same speaker are compact while those from different speakers are dispersed. Experiments are conducted on VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2. Results on the VoxCeleb1 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LSTSL",

This model employs an invertible deep neural network to transform a complex distribution to a simple Gaussian, so that the linear Gaussian model can be readily established in the transformed space. We tested this NDA model on a speaker recognition task where the deep speaker vectors (x-vectors) are presumably non-Gaussian.

We hypothesize that the embeddings will contain minimal phonetic information since the TTS decoder will obtain that information from the textual input. TTS reconstruction can also be combined with speaker classification to enhance these embeddings further. Once trained, the speaker encoder computes representations for the speaker verification task, while the rest of the TTS blocks are discarded. We investigated training TTS from either manual or ASR-generated transcripts. The latter allows us to train embeddings on datasets without manual transcripts. We compared ASR transcripts and Kaldi phone alignments as TTS inputs, showing that the latter performed better due to their finer resolution. Unsupervised TTS embeddings improved EER by 2.06% absolute with regard to i-vectors for the LibriTTS dataset.

To address these limitations, here we propose an end-to-end framework for speech inpainting, the context-based retrieval of missing or severely distorted parts of time-frequency representation of speech. The framework is based on a convolutional U-Net trained via deep feature losses, obtained using speechVGG, a deep speech feature extractor pre-trained on an auxiliary word classification task. Our evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed framework can recover large portions of missing or distorted time-frequency representation of speech, up to 400 ms and 3.2 kHz in bandwidth.

In recent years, speech emotion recognition using Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) has been studied actively because the model can focus on a particular temporal region that contains strong emotional characteristics. One of the model's weaknesses is that it cannot consider the statistics of speech features, which are known to be effective for speech emotion recognition. Besides, this method cannot train individual attention parameters for different descriptors because it handles the input sequence by a single BLSTM. In this paper, we introduce feature segmentation and multi-stream processing into attention-based BLSTM to solve these problems.

However, the suppression of point interferers relies on the accurate estimation of the number and directions of point interferers, which is a difficult task in practical situations. In this paper, we propose a post-filtering algorithm, which is independent of the number and directions of point interferers. Specifically, we assume that the point interferers are continuously distributed at each direction of the plane but the probability of the interferer occurring at each direction is different in order to calculate the spatial covariance matrix of the point interferers. Moreover, we assume that the noise is additive and uncorrelated with the target signal to obtain the power spectral densities (PSDs) of the target signal and noise. Finally, the proposed post-filter is calculated using the estimated PSDs.

However, MDC only applies the spatial features as the additional information, which does not fuse them with the spectral features very well. So it is difficult to learn mutual relationship between spatial and spectral features. Besides, the training objective of MDC is defined at embedding vectors, rather than real separated sources, which may damage the separation performance. In this work, we deal with spatial and spectral features as two different modalities. We propose the gated recurrent fusion (GRF) method to adaptively select and fuse the relevant information from spectral and spatial features by making use of the gate and memory modules. In addition, to solve the training objective problem of MDC, the real separated sources are used as the training objectives. Specifically, we apply the deep clustering network to extract deep embedding features. Instead of using the unsupervised K-means clustering to estimate binary masks, another supervised network is utilized to learn soft masks from these deep embedding features.

Sound source separation is thus often required as a preprocessing step prior to speech recognition to improve the signal to distortion ratio (SDR). Recently, a combination of beamforming and speech separation networks have been proposed to improve the target source quality in the direction of arrival of interest. However, with this type of approach, the neural network needs to be trained in advance for a specific microphone array geometry, which limits versatility when adding/removing microphones, or changing the shape of the array. The solution presented in this paper is to train a neural network on pairs of microphones with different spacing and acoustic environmental conditions, and then use this network to estimate a time-frequency mask from all the pairs of microphones forming the array with an arbitrary shape. Using this mask, the target and noise covariance matrices can be estimated, and then used to perform generalized eigenvalue (GEV) beamforming.

We retrain all the models above in a multi-task learning(MTL) setting, where one branch of a shared network is trained as an AM, while the second branch classifies the whole sequence to be true-trigger or not. Results demonstrate that networks with self-attention layers yield ~60% relative reduction in false reject rates for a given false-alarm rate, while requiring 10% fewer parameters. When trained in the MTL setup, self-attention networks yield further accuracy improvements. On-device measurements show that we observe 70% relative reduction in inference time. Additionally, the proposed network architectures are ~5× faster to train",

    "abstract": "Compression and quantization is important to neural networks in general and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in particular, especially when they operate in real-time on resource-constrained devices. By using fewer number of bits for the model weights, the model size becomes much smaller while inference time is reduced significantly, with the cost of degraded performance. Such degradation can be potentially addressed by the so-called quantization-aware training (QAT). Existing QATs mostly take into account the quantization in forward propagation, while ignoring the quantization loss in gradient calculation during back-propagation. In this work, we introduce a novel QAT scheme based on absolute-cosine regularization (ACosR), which enforces a prior, quantization-friendly distribution to the model weights. We apply this novel approach into ASR task assuming a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) architecture. The results show that there is zero to little degradation between floating-point, 8-bit, and 6-bit ACosR models. Weight distributions further confirm that in-training weights are very close to quantization levels when ACosR is applied",

To address this issue, we propose a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition system called LASO (listen attentively, and spell once). Because of the non-autoregressive property, LASO predicts a textual token in the sequence without the dependence on other tokens. Without beam-search, the one-pass propagation much reduces inference time cost of LASO. And because the model is based on the attention based feedforward structure, the computation can be implemented in parallel efficiently. We conduct experiments on publicly available Chinese dataset AISHELL-1. LASO achieves a character error rate of 6.4%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive transformer model (6.7%).

In our previous study, we proposed an algorithm to generate SES by employing WaveNet as a sound generator and confirmed that SES can successfully convey emotional information. The proposed algorithm generates SES using only emotional IDs, which results in having no linguistic information. We call the generated sounds \"speech-like\" because they sound as if they are uttered by human beings although they contain no linguistic information. We could synthesize natural sounding acoustic signals that are fairly different from vocoder sounds to make the best use of WaveNet. To flexibly control the strength of emotions, this paper proposes to use a state of voiced, unvoiced, and silence (VUS) as auxiliary features. Three types of emotional speech, namely, neutral, angry, and happy, were generated and subjectively evaluated. Experimental results reveal the following: (1) VUS can control the strength of SES by changing the durations of VUS states, (2) VUS with narrow F0 distribution can express stronger emotions than that with wide F0 distribution, and (3) the smaller the unvoiced percentage is, the stronger the emotional impression is",

The MDARBM decomposes the visible-hidden connections of an RBM into domain-specific factors and a domain-independent factor to make it adaptable to multiple domains of speech. By switching the domain-specific factors from the source speaker and emotion to the target ones, the model can perform a simultaneous conversion.

    "abstract": "Attention-based seq2seq text-to-speech systems, especially those use self-attention networks (SAN), have achieved state-of-art performance. But an expressive corpus with rich prosody is still challenging to model as 1) prosodic aspects, which span across different sentential granularities and mainly determine acoustic expressiveness, are difficult to quantize and label and 2) the current seq2seq framework extracts prosodic information solely from a text encoder, which is easily collapsed to an averaged expression for expressive contents. In this paper, we propose a context extractor, which is built upon SAN-based text encoder, to sufficiently exploit the sentential context over an expressive corpus for seq2seq-based TTS. Our context extractor first collects prosodic-related sentential context information from different SAN layers and then aggregates them to learn a comprehensive sentence representation to enhance the expressiveness of the final generated speech. Specifically, we investigate two methods of context aggregation: 1) direct aggregation which directly concatenates the outputs of different SAN layers, and 2) weighted aggregation which uses multi-head attention to automatically learn contributions for different SAN layers. Experiments on two expressive corpora show that our approach can produce more natural speech with much richer prosodic variations, and weighted aggregation is more superior in modeling expressivity",

To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework for modeling the fine-grained latent variables, considering the dependence on an input text, a hierarchical linguistic structure, and a temporal structure of latent variables. This framework consists of a multi-grained variational autoencoder, a conditional prior, and a multi-level auto-regressive latent converter to obtain the different time-resolution latent variables and sample the finer-level latent variables from the coarser-level ones by taking into account the input text. Experimental results indicate an appropriate method of sampling fine-grained latent variables without the reference signal at the synthesis stage.

It has been fueled further by its link to the issue of validity of acted emotion databases. Much of the speech and vocal emotion research has relied on acted emotion databases as valid proxies for studying natural emotions. To create models that generalize to natural settings, it is crucial to work with valid prototypes — ones that can be assumed to reliably represent natural emotions. More concretely, it is important to study emulated emotions against natural emotions in terms of their physiological, and psychological concomitants. In this paper, we present an on-scale systematic study of the differences between natural and acted vocal emotions. We use a self-attention based emotion classification model to understand the phonetic bases of emotions by discovering the most ‘attended' phonemes for each class of emotions. We then compare these attended-phonemes in their importance and distribution across acted and natural classes. Our tests show significant differences in the manner and choice of phonemes in acted and natural speech, concluding moderate to low validity and value in using acted speech databases for emotion classification tasks",

Compared with the widely used residual neural network (ResNet) and time-delay neural network (TDNN) based architectures, two main improvements are proposed: 1) We use densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) to encode the short term context information of the speaker. 2) A bidirectional attentive pooling strategy is proposed to further model the long term temporal context and aggregate the important frames which reflect the speaker identity. We evaluate the proposed architecture on the task of text-dependent speaker verification in the Interspeech 2020 Far Field Speaker Verification Challenge (FFSVC2020).

We particularly focus on far-field text-dependent SV from single (task1) and multiple microphone arrays (task3). The major challenges in such scenarios are short utterance and cross-channel and distance mismatch for enrollment and test. With the belief that better speaker embedding can alleviate the effects from short utterance, we introduce a new speaker embedding architecture — ResNet-BAM, which integrates a bottleneck attention module with ResNet as a simple and efficient way to further improve representation power of ResNet. This contribution brings up to 1% EER reduction. We further address the mismatch problem in three directions. First, domain adversarial training, which aims to learn domain-invariant features, can yield to 0.8% EER reduction. Second, front-end signal processing, including WPE and beamforming, has no obvious contribution, but together with data selection and domain adversarial training, can further contribute to 0.5% EER reduction. Finally, data augmentation, which works with a specifically-designed data selection strategy, can lead to 2% EER reduction. Together with the above contributions, in the middle challenge results, our single submission system (without multi-system fusion) achieves the first and second place on task 1 and task 3, respectively",

Two open-access corpora, CHData in Mandarin and VoxCeleb2 in English, are augmented using multiple methods and mixed with the augmented FFSVC data to form the final training data. Four different model structures are used to model speaker characteristics: ResNet, extended time-delay neural network (ETDNN), Transformer, and factorized TDNN (FTDNN), whose output values are pooled across time using the self-attentive structure, the statistic pooling structure, and the GVLAD structure. The final results are derived by fusing the adaptively normalized scores of the four systems with a two-stage fusion method, which achieves a minimum of the detection cost function (minDCF) of 0.3407 and an equal error rate (EER) of 2.67% on the development set of the challenge",

Unlike previous works that used lip movement on video clips or pre-enrolled speaker information as an auxiliary conditional feature, we use a single face image of the target speaker. In this task, the conditional feature is obtained from facial appearance in cross-modal biometric task, where audio and visual identity representations are shared in latent space. Learnt identities from facial images enforce the network to isolate matched speakers and extract the voices from mixed speech. It solves the permutation problem caused by swapped channel outputs, frequently occurred in speech separation tasks. The proposed method is far more practical than video-based speech separation since user profile images are readily available on many platforms. Also, unlike speaker-aware separation methods, it is applicable on separation with unseen speakers who have never been enrolled before.

To this end, we propose a novel training strategy that not only optimises metrics across modalities, but also enforces intra-class feature separation within each of the modalities.

A series of audio-visual multi-channel speech separation front-end components based on TF masking, filter & sum and mask-based MVDR beamforming approaches were developed. To reduce the error cost mismatch between the separation and recognition components, they were jointly fine-tuned using the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss function, or a multi-task criterion interpolation with scale-invariant signal to noise ratio (Si-SNR) error cost. Experiments suggest that the proposed multi-channel AVSR system outperforms the baseline audio-only ASR system by up to 6.81% (26.83% relative) and 22.22% (56.87% relative) absolute word error rate (WER) reduction on overlapped speech constructed using either simulation or replaying of the lipreading sentence 2 (LRS2) dataset respectively",

Second, we propose a novel recognition paradigm, called MultiRate Ensemble (MRE), that combines a \"lean\" and a \"full\" MobiLipNetV3 in the lipreading pipeline, with the latter applied at a lower frame rate. This architecture yields a family of systems offering multiple accuracy vs. efficiency operating points depending on the frame-rate decimation of the \"full\" model, thus allowing adaptation to the available device resources. We evaluate our approach on the TCD-TIMIT corpus, popular in speaker-independent lipreading of continuous speech. The proposed MRE family of systems can be up to 73 times more efficient compared to residual neural network based lipreading, and up to twice as MobiLipNetV2, while in both cases reaching up to 8% absolute WER reduction, depending on the MRE chosen operating point. For example, a temporal decimation of three yields a 7% absolute WER reduction and a 26% relative decrease in computations over MobiLipNetV2",

While utilizing PWG as a vocoder to generate speech on the basis of acoustic features such as spectral and prosodic features, PWG generates high-fidelity speech. However, when the input acoustic features include unseen pitches, the pitch accuracy of PWG-generated speech degrades because of the fixed and generic network of PWG without prior knowledge of speech periodicity.

However, collecting the required training data and building these advanced systems from scratch are time and resource consuming. An economical approach is to develop a neural vocoder to enhance the speech generated by existing or low-cost TTS systems. Nonetheless, this approach usually suffers from two issues: 1) temporal mismatches between TTS and natural waveforms and 2) acoustic mismatches between training and testing data. To address these issues, we adopt a cyclic voice conversion (VC) model to generate temporally matched pseudo-VC data for training and acoustically matched enhanced data for testing the neural vocoders. Because of the generality, this framework can be applied to arbitrary TTS systems and neural vocoders.

Autoregressive WaveNet is capable of producing high-fidelity audio, but is too slow for real-time synthesis. As a remedy, Parallel WaveNet was proposed, which can produce audio faster than real time through distillation of an autoregressive teacher into a feedforward student network. A shortcoming of this approach, however, is that a large amount of recorded speech data is required to produce high-quality student models, and this data is not always available. In this paper, we propose StrawNet: a self-training approach to train a Parallel WaveNet. Self-training is performed using the synthetic examples generated by the autoregressive WaveNet teacher. We show that, in low-data regimes, training on high-fidelity synthetic data from an autoregressive teacher model is superior to training the student model on (much fewer) examples of recorded speech.

Speech is decomposed into multiple subband signals with linear prediction to reduce the complexity of neural vocoder. A novel subband-based autoregressive model is proposed to learn the joint distribution of the subband sequences by introducing a reasonable assumption, which keeps the dependence between subbands while accelerating the inference speed. Based upon the human auditory perception sensitivity to the harmonic speech components in the baseband, we allocate more computational resources to model the low-frequency subband to synthesize natural phase and magnitude of the synthesized speech. Both objective and subjective tests show the proposed subband LPCNet neural vocoder can synthesize higher quality speech than the original fullband one (MOS 4.62 vs. 4.54), at a rate nearly three times faster",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a reverberation module for source-filter-based neural vocoders that improves the performance of reverberant effect modeling. This module uses the output waveform of neural vocoders as an input and produces a reverberant waveform by convolving the input with a room impulse response (RIR). We propose two approaches to parameterizing and estimating the RIR. The first approach assumes a global time-invariant (GTI) RIR and directly learns the values of the RIR on a training dataset. The second approach assumes an utterance-level time-variant (UTV) RIR, which is invariant within one utterance but varies across utterances, and uses another neural network to predict the RIR values. We add the proposed reverberation module to the phase spectrum predictor (PSP) of a HiNet vocoder and jointly train the model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module was helpful for modeling the reverberation effect and improving the perceived quality of generated reverberant speech. The UTV-RIR was shown to be more robust than the GTI-RIR to unknown reverberation conditions and achieved a perceptually better reverberation effect",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a modeling-by-generation (MbG) excitation vocoder for a neural text-to-speech (TTS) system. Recently proposed neural excitation vocoders can realize qualified waveform generation by combining a vocal tract filter with a WaveNet-based glottal excitation generator. However, when these vocoders are used in a TTS system, the quality of synthesized speech is often degraded owing to a mismatch between training and synthesis steps. Specifically, the vocoder is separately trained from an acoustic model front-end. Therefore, estimation errors of the acoustic model are inevitably boosted throughout the synthesis process of the vocoder backend. To address this problem, we propose to incorporate an MbG structure into the vocoder's training process. In the proposed method, the excitation signal is extracted by the acoustic model's generated spectral parameters, and the neural vocoder is then optimized not only to learn the target excitation's distribution but also to compensate for the estimation errors occurring from the acoustic model. Furthermore, as the generated spectral parameters are shared in the training and synthesis steps, their mismatch conditions can be reduced effectively. The experimental results verify that the proposed system provides high-quality synthetic speech by achieving a mean opinion score of 4.57 within the TTS framework",

    "abstract": "Encoder-decoder based methods have become popular for automatic speech recognition (ASR), thanks to their simplified processing stages and low reliance on prior knowledge. However, large amounts of acoustic data with paired transcriptions is generally required to train an effective encoder-decoder model, which is expensive, time-consuming to be collected and not always readily available. However unpaired speech data is abundant, hence several semi-supervised learning methods, such as teacher-student (T/S) learning and pseudo-labeling, have recently been proposed to utilize this potentially valuable resource. In this paper, a novel T/S learning with conditional posterior distribution for encoder-decoder based ASR is proposed. Specifically, the 1-best hypotheses and the conditional posterior distribution from the teacher are exploited to provide more effective supervision. Combined with model perturbation techniques, the proposed method reduces WER by 19.2% relatively on the LibriSpeech benchmark, compared with a system trained using only paired data.

Recently, there is considerable interest in applying Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods that leverage substantial amount of unlabeled speech for improving AM. This paper proposes a novel Teacher-Student based knowledge distillation (KD) approach for sequence discriminative training, where reference state sequence of unlabeled data are estimated using a strong Bi-directional LSTM Teacher model which is then used to guide the sMBR training of a LSTM Student model. We build a strong supervised LSTM AM baseline by using 45000 hours of labeled multi-dialect English data for initial CE or CTC training stage, and 11000 hours of its British English subset for sMBR training phase. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we leverage an additional 38000 hours of unlabeled British English data at only sMBR stage, which yields a relative Word Error Rate (WER) improvement in the range of 6%–11% over supervised baselines in clean and noisy test conditions",

    "abstract": "Transformers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many tasks in natural language processing and speech processing. One of the key components in Transformers is self-attention, which attends to the whole input sequence at every layer. However, the computational and memory cost of self-attention is square of the input sequence length, which is a major concern in automatic speech recognition (ASR) where the input sequence can be very long. In this paper, we propose to use a technique called adaptive span self-attention for ASR tasks, which is originally proposed for language modeling. Our method enables the network to learn an appropriate size and position of the window for each layer and head, and our newly introduced scheme can further control the window size depending on the future and past contexts. Thus, it can save both computational complexity and memory size from the square order of the input length to the adaptive linear order. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by using several ASR tasks, and the proposed adaptive span methods consistently improved the performance from the conventional fixed span methods",

    "abstract": "Subwords are the most widely used output units in end-to-end speech recognition. They combine the best of two worlds by modeling the majority of frequent words directly and at the same time allow open vocabulary speech recognition by backing off to shorter units or characters to construct words unseen during training. However, mapping text to subwords is ambiguous and often multiple segmentation variants are possible. Yet, many systems are trained using only the most likely segmentation. Recent research suggests that sampling subword segmentations during training acts as a regularizer for neural machine translation and speech recognition models, leading to performance improvements. In this work, we conduct a principled investigation on the regularizing effect of the subword segmentation sampling method for a streaming end-to-end speech recognition task. In particular, we evaluate the subword regularization contribution depending on the size of the training dataset. Our results suggest that subword regularization provides a consistent improvement of 2–8% relative word-error-rate reduction, even in a large-scale setting with datasets up to a size of 20k hours. Further, we analyze the effect of subword regularization on recognition of unseen words and its implications on beam diversity",

Language model integration is straightforward with the clear separation of acoustic model and language model in classical HMM-based modeling. In contrast, multiple integration schemes have been proposed for attention models In this work, we present a novel method for language model integration into implicit-alignment based sequence-to-sequence models. Log-linear model combination of acoustic and language model is performed with a per-token renormalization. This allows us to compute the full normalization term efficiently both in training and in testing This is compared to a global renormalization scheme which is equivalent to applying shallow fusion in training The proposed methods show good improvements over standard model combination (shallow fusion) on our state-of-the-art Librispeech system.

An alternative sequential learning was implemented by the temporal convolutional network (TCN) which is seen as a variant of one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN). In general, RNN and TCN are fitted to capture the long-term and the short-term features over natural sentences, respectively. This paper is motivated to fulfill TCN as the encoder to extract short-term dependencies and then use RNN as the decoder for language modeling where the dependencies are integrated in a long-term semantic fashion for word prediction. A new sequential learning based on the convolutional recurrent network (CRN) is developed to characterize the local dependencies as well as the global semantics in word sequences. Importantly, the stochastic modeling for CRN is proposed to facilitate model capacity in neural language model where the uncertainties in training sentences are represented for variational inference. The complementary benefits of CNN and RNN are merged in sequential learning where the latent variable space is constructed as a generative model for sequential prediction.

Nowadays, language modeling is commonly approached with neural networks using softmax and cross entropy. In this work, we are curious to see if introducing large-margins to neural language models would improve the perplexity and consequently word error rate in automatic speech recognition. Specifically, we first implement and test various types of conventional margins following the previous works in face recognition. To address the distribution of natural language data, we then compare different strategies for word vector norm-scaling. After that, we apply the best norm-scaling setup in combination with various margins and conduct neural language models rescoring experiments in automatic speech recognition.

During inference, the target sequence is initialized with the greedy CTC outputs and low-confidence tokens are masked based on the CTC probabilities. Based on the conditional dependence between output tokens, these masked low-confidence tokens are then predicted conditioning on the high-confidence tokens. Experimental results on different speech recognition tasks show that Mask CTC outperforms the standard CTC model (e.g., 17.9% → 12.1% WER on WSJ) and approaches the autoregressive model, requiring much less inference time using CPUs (0.07 RTF in Python implementation).

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) models have gained attention in the research field of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Many E2E models proposed so far assume left-to-right autoregressive generation of an output token sequence except for connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and its variants. However, left-to-right decoding cannot consider the future output context, and it is not always optimal for ASR. One of the non-left-to-right models is known as non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) and has been intensively investigated in the area of neural machine translation (NMT) research. One NAT model, mask-predict, has been applied to ASR but the model needs some heuristics or additional component to estimate the length of the output token sequence. This paper proposes to apply another type of NAT called insertion-based models, that were originally proposed for NMT, to ASR tasks. Insertion-based models solve the above mask-predict issues and can generate an arbitrary generation order of an output sequence. In addition, we introduce a new formulation of joint training of the insertion-based models and CTC. This formulation reinforces CTC by making it dependent on insertion-based token generation in a non-autoregressive manner. We conducted experiments on three public benchmarks and achieved competitive performance to strong autoregressive Transformer with a similar decoding condition",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Traditional supervised voice activity detection (VAD) methods work well in clean and controlled scenarios, with performance severely degrading in real-world applications. One possible bottleneck is that speech in the wild contains unpredictable noise types, hence frame-level label prediction is difficult, which is required for traditional supervised VAD training. In contrast, we propose a general-purpose VAD (GPVAD) framework, which can be easily trained from noisy data in a weakly supervised fashion, requiring only clip-level labels. We proposed two GPVAD models, one full (GPV-F), trained on 527 Audioset sound events, and one binary (GPV-B), only distinguishing speech and noise. We evaluate the two GPV models against a CRNN based standard VAD model (VAD-C) on three different evaluation protocols (clean, synthetic noise, real data). Results show that our proposed GPV-F demonstrates competitive performance in clean and synthetic scenarios compared to traditional VAD-C. Further, in real-world evaluation, GPV-F largely outperforms VAD-C in terms of frame-level evaluation metrics as well as segment-level ones. With a much lower requirement for frame-labeled data, the naive binary clip-level GPV-B model can still achieve comparable performance to VAD-C in real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel and noise robust method for the detection of vowels in speech signals. The proposed approach combines variational mode decomposition (VMD) and non-local means (NLM) estimation for the detection of vowels in a speech sequence. The VMD algorithm is used to determine a number of variational mode functions (VMFs). The lower-order VMFs represent the frequency contents corresponding to vowel regions. Thus by combining the lower-order VMFs and reconstructing the speech signal back, the energy corresponding to the vowel regions is enhanced while the non-vowel regions are suppressed. At the same time, the ill-effect of noise is also reduced. Finally, as reported in an earlier work, application of NLM followed by convolution with first-order difference of Gaussian window is performed on the reconstructed signal to determine the vowel region. The performance of proposed approach for the task of detecting vowels in speech is compared with three existing techniques and observed to be superior under clean as well as noisy test conditions",

Our second contribution aims at making the proposed voice activity detection model robust to domain mismatch. To that end, a domain classification branch is added to the network and trained in an adversarial manner. The same DIHARD dataset, drawn from 11 different domains is used for evaluation under two scenarios. In the in-domain scenario where the training and test sets cover the exact same domains, we show that the domain-adversarial approach does not degrade performance of the proposed end-to-end model. In the out-domain scenario where the test domain is different from training domains, it brings a relative improvement of more than 10%.

Many speech processing applications need the information of VOP to extract features from the speech signal. In such cases the overall performance largely depends on the exact detection of VOP location. There are many algorithms proposed in the literature for the automatic detection of VOPs. Most of these methods assume that the given speech signal is produced at normal speech rate. All the parameters for smoothing speech signal evidence as well as hypothesizing VOPs are set accordingly. However, these parameter settings may not work well for variable speech rate conditions. This work proposes a dynamic first order Gaussian differentiator (FOGD) window based approach to overcome this issue.

Recently, deep neural network (DNN)-based VADs have achieved better performance than conventional signal processing methods. The existed DNN-based models always handcrafted a fixed window to make use of the contextual speech information to improve the performance of VAD. However, the fixed window of contextual speech information can't handle various unpredictable noise environments and highlight the critical speech information to VAD task. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive multiple receptive-field attention neural network, called MLNET, to finish VAD task.

    "abstract": "Only a handful of the world's languages are abundant with the resources that enable practical applications of speech processing technologies. One of the methods to overcome this problem is to use the resources existing in other languages to train a multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, which, intuitively, should learn some universal phonetic representations. In this work, we focus on gaining a deeper understanding of how general these representations might be, and how individual phones are getting improved in a multilingual setting. To that end, we select a phonetically diverse set of languages, and perform a series of monolingual, multilingual and crosslingual (zero-shot) experiments. The ASR is trained to recognize the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) token sequences. We observe significant improvements across all languages in the multilingual setting, and stark degradation in the crosslingual setting, where the model, among other errors, considers Javanese as a tone language. Notably, as little as 10 hours of the target language training data tremendously reduces ASR error rates. Our analysis uncovered that even the phones that are unique to a single language can benefit greatly from adding training data from other languages — an encouraging result for the low-resource speech community",

To this end, we analyzed a corpus containing speech material from Dutch native primary school pupils who read texts aloud at their mastery reading level. We investigated reading strategies, reading miscues, a novel reading miscue index and their relationship with AVI level (reading level) and gender. We found a significant effect of AVI level on reading miscue index, but did not find a decrease of reading miscue index as AVI level increased. Pupils mostly used lexical reading strategies, which seem to increase when AVI level increases. Miscues most frequently concerned low-frequency words with at least two syllables, and omitted and inserted words were generally high frequent, unstressed function words. These results provide insights that help design the content of reading interventions and that can contribute to developing and improving ASR-based reading software.

The advantage of rtMRI is that it provides dynamic information about the full midsagittal plane of the upper airway, with a high ‘relative' spatial resolution. In this work, we estimated midsagittal rtMRI images of the vocal tract for speaker dependent AAI, using MGC-LSP spectral features as input. We applied FC-DNNs, CNNs and recurrent neural networks, and have shown that LSTMs are the most suitable for this task. As objective evaluation we measured normalized MSE, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and its complex wavelet version (CW-SSIM). The results indicate that the combination of FC-DNNs and LSTMs can achieve smooth generated MR images of the vocal tract, which are similar to the original MRI recordings (average CW-SSIM: 0.94)",

As is to be expected for a recent change, younger speakers glottalise more than older speakers, but in perception both age groups appear to use glottalisation similarly. This study examines whether links between the production and perception of glottalisation exist at the level of the individual. We determined how frequently individuals used glottalisation in production, and analysed this against how heavily the same individuals weighted glottalisation in perception. Although differences have previously been found at the age group level, at the level of the individual we found no correlation between how heavily listeners weighted glottalisation in perception and how frequently they used glottalisation in production for either the younger or the older listeners. Nevertheless, we did find a small number of individuals who exhibited an alignment of their production and perception repertoires, which may suggest that only a small proportion of individuals exhibit a strong production-perception link, and we propose that these individuals may be important for driving the progression of change",

We also evaluate two methods of fusing speech and text modalities and show that a simple fusion mechanism can outperform more complex ones when using SSL models that have similar architectural properties to BERT",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC), as a self-supervised objective, has enjoyed success in learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled data, and the learned representations are rich for many downstream tasks. However, the connection between low self-supervised loss and strong performance in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this work, we propose Vector-Quantized Autoregressive Predictive Coding (VQ-APC), a novel model that produces quantized representations, allowing us to explicitly control the amount of information encoded in the representations. By studying a sequence of increasingly limited models, we reveal the constituents of the learned representations. In particular, we confirm the presence of information with probing tasks, while showing the absence of information with mutual information, uncovering the model's preference in preserving speech information as its capacity becomes constrained. We find that there exists a point where phonetic and speaker information are amplified to maximize a self-supervised objective. As a byproduct, the learned codes for a particular model capacity correspond well to English phones",

In this paper, we present an XLNet-like pretraining scheme \"Speech-XLNet\" to learn speech representations with self-attention networks (SANs). Firstly, we find that by shuffling the speech frame orders, Speech-XLNet serves as a strong regularizer which encourages the SAN network to make inferences by focusing on global structures through its attention weights. Secondly, Speech-XLNet also allows the model to explore bi-directional context information while maintaining the autoregressive training manner. Visualization results show that our approach can generalize better with more flattened and widely distributed optimas compared to the conventional approach. Experimental results on TIMIT demonstrate that Speech-XLNet greatly improves hybrid SAN/HMM in terms of both convergence speed and recognition accuracy. Our best systems achieve a relative improvement of 15.2% on the TIMIT task. Besides, we also apply our pretrained model to an End-to-End SAN with WSJ dataset and WER is reduced by up to 68% when only a few hours of transcribed data is used",

However, the imperfect ASR result makes unsupervised learning difficult to consistently improve recognition performance especially in the case that multiple powerful teacher models are unavailable. In contrast to conventional unsupervised learning approaches, we adopt the multi-task learning (MTL) framework where the n-th best ASR hypothesis is used as the label of each task. The seq2seq network is updated through the MTL framework so as to find the common representation that can cover multiple hypotheses. By doing so, the effect of the hard-decision errors can be alleviated. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-learning methods through ASR experiments in an accent adaptation task between the US and British English speech. Our experiment results show that our method can reduce the WER on the British speech data from 14.55% to 10.36% compared to the baseline model trained with the US English data only.

    "abstract": "High-performance anti-spoofing models for automatic speaker verification (ASV), have been widely used to protect ASV by identifying and filtering spoofing audio that is deliberately generated by text-to-speech, voice conversion, audio replay, etc. However, it has been shown that high-performance anti-spoofing models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks, that are indistinguishable from original data but result in the incorrect predictions, are dangerous for anti-spoofing models and not in dispute we should detect them at any cost. To explore this issue, we proposed to employ Mockingjay, a self-supervised learning based model, to protect anti-spoofing models against adversarial attacks in the black-box scenario. Self-supervised learning models are effective in improving downstream task performance like phone classification or ASR. However, their effect in defense for adversarial attacks has not been explored yet. In this work, we explore the robustness of self-supervised learned high-level representations by using them in the defense against adversarial attacks. A layerwise noise-to-signal ratio (LNSR) is proposed to quantize and measure the effectiveness of deep models in countering adversarial noise. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset demonstrate that high-level representations extracted by Mockingjay can prevent the transferability of adversarial examples, and successfully counter black-box attacks",

In this work, we propose Convolutional Deep Markov Model (ConvDMM), a Gaussian state-space model with non-linear emission and transition functions modelled by deep neural networks. This unsupervised model is trained using black box variational inference. A deep convolutional neural network is used as an inference network for structured variational approximation.

Furthermore, we found that ConvDMM complements self-supervised methods like Wav2Vec and PASE, improving on the results achieved with any of the methods alone.

Over 20 years, about 4200 hours of biographic interviews from more than 1,000 participants were recorded. Spoken language is a strong indicator for declining cognitive resources, as it is affected in early stage. Hence, various research topics related to aging like dementia, could be analyzed based on data such as the ILSE interviews. The analysis of language capabilities requires transcribed speech. Since manual transcriptions are time and cost consuming, we aim to automatically transcribing the ILSE data using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). The recognition of ILSE interviews is very demanding due to the combination of various challenges: 20 year old analog two-speaker one-channel recordings of low signal quality, emotional and personal interviews between doctor and participant, and repeated recordings of aging, partly fragile individuals. In this study, we describe ongoing work to develop hybrid Hidden Markov Model (HMM)- Deep Neural Network (DNN) based ASR system for the ILSE corpus.

Our proposal is inspired by the additive-margin softmax (AM-Softmax) loss reported earlier. In AM-Softmax loss, a constant margin is used for all training samples. However, the angle between the feature vector and the ground-truth class center is rarely the same for all samples. Furthermore, the angle also changes during training. Thus, it is more reasonable to set a dynamic margin for each training sample. In this paper, we propose to dynamically set the margin of each training sample commensurate with the cosine angle of that sample, hence, the name dynamic-additive-margin softmax (DAM-Softmax) loss. More specifically, the smaller the cosine angle is, the larger the margin between the training sample and the corresponding class in the feature space should be to promote intra-class compactness. Experimental results show that the proposed DAM-Softmax loss achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VoxCeleb dataset by 1.94% in equal error rate (EER).

Most Speaker Verification (SV) systems extract representations for both the enrollment and test utterances called embeddings, and then, these systems usually apply a similarity metric or complex back-ends to carry out the verification process. Unlike previous works, we propose to take advantage of the knowledge acquired by a DNN to model the speakers from the training set since the last layer of the DNN can be seen as an embedding dictionary which represents train speakers. Thus, after the initial training phase, we introduce a new learnable vector for each enrollment speaker. Furthermore, to lead this training process, we employ a loss function more appropriate for verification, the approximated Detection Cost Function ( aDCF) loss function. The new strategy to produce enrollment models for each target speaker was tested on the RSR-Part II database for text-dependent speaker verification, where the proposed approach outperforms the reference system based on directly averaging of the embeddings extracted from the enroll data using the network and the application of cosine similarity",

We show that the model adapted from the initial layers outperforms the model adapted from the final layers. Based on this evidence, and inspired by the works in image recognition field, we hypothesize that low-level convolutional neural network (CNN) layers characterize domain-specific component while high-level CNN layers are domain-independent and have more discriminative power. For adapting these domain-specific components, angular margin softmax (AMSoftmax) applied on the CNN-based implementation of the x-vector architecture. In addition, to reduce the problem of over-fitting on the limited target data, transfer learning on the batch norm layers is investigated. Mean shift and covariance estimation of batch norm allows to map the represented components of the target domain to the source domain.

In this paper, like the prototype network loss in the few-short learning and the generalized end-to-end loss, we optimize the cosine distances between speaker embeddings and their corresponding centroids rather than the weight vectors in the classification layer. For the intra-class compactness, we impose the additive angular margin to shorten the cosine distance between speaker embeddings belonging to the same speaker. Meanwhile, we also explicitly improve the inter-class separability by enlarging the cosine distance between different speaker centroids.

The successful x-vector architecture is a Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) that applies statistics pooling to project variable-length utterances into fixed-length speaker characterizing embeddings. In this paper, we propose multiple enhancements to this architecture based on recent trends in the related fields of face verification and computer vision. Firstly, the initial frame layers can be restructured into 1-dimensional Res2Net modules with impactful skip connections. Similarly to SE-ResNet, we introduce Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in these modules to explicitly model channel interdependencies. The SE block expands the temporal context of the frame layer by rescaling the channels according to global properties of the recording. Secondly, neural networks are known to learn hierarchical features, with each layer operating on a different level of complexity. To leverage this complementary information, we aggregate and propagate features of different hierarchical levels. Finally, we improve the statistics pooling module with channel-dependent frame attention. This enables the network to focus on different subsets of frames during each of the channel's statistics estimation.

    "abstract": "Spoken language ‘grammatical error correction' (GEC) is an important mechanism to help learners of a foreign language, here English, improve their spoken grammar. GEC is challenging for non-native spoken language due to interruptions from disfluent speech events such as repetitions and false starts and issues in strictly defining what is acceptable in spoken language. Furthermore there is little labelled data to train models. One way to mitigate the impact of speech events is to use a disfluency detection (DD) model. Removing the detected disfluencies converts the speech transcript to be closer to written language, which has significantly more labelled training data. This paper considers two types of approaches to leveraging DD models to boost spoken GEC performance. One is sequential, a separately trained DD model acts as a pre-processing module providing a more structured input to the GEC model. The second approach is to train DD and GEC models in an end-to-end fashion, simultaneously optimising both modules. Embeddings enable end-to-end models to have a richer information flow. Experimental results show that DD effectively regulates GEC input; end-to-end training works well when fine-tuned on limited labelled in-domain data; and improving DD by incorporating acoustic information helps improve spoken GEC",

One aspect of deep learning systems is that they do not require expert derived features, operating directly on the original signal such as a speech recognition (ASR) transcript. This, however, increases their potential susceptibility to adversarial attacks as a form of candidate malpractice. In this paper the sensitivity of SLA systems to a universal black-box attack on the ASR text output is explored. The aim is to obtain a single, universal phrase to maximally increase any candidate's score. Four approaches to detect such adversarial attacks are also described. All the systems, and associated detection approaches, are evaluated on a free (spontaneous) speaking section from a Business English test. It is shown that on deep learning based SLA systems the average candidate score can be increased by almost one grade level using a single six word phrase appended to the end of the response hypothesis. Although these large gains can be obtained, they can be easily detected based on detection shifts from the scores of a \"traditional\" Gaussian Process based grader",

    "title": "Ensemble Approaches for Uncertainty in Spoken Language Assessment",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has dramatically improved the performance of automated systems on a range of tasks including spoken language assessment. One of the issues with these deep learning approaches is that they tend to be overconfident in the decisions that they make, with potentially serious implications for deployment of systems for high-stakes examinations. This paper examines the use of ensemble approaches to improve both the reliability of the scores that are generated, and the ability to detect where the system has made predictions beyond acceptable errors. In this work assessment is treated as a regression problem. Deep density networks, and ensembles of these models, are used as the predictive models. Given an ensemble of models measures of uncertainty, for example the variance of the predicted distributions, can be obtained and used for detecting outlier predictions. However, these ensemble approaches increase the computational and memory requirements of the system. To address this problem the ensemble is distilled into a single mixture density network. The performance of the systems is evaluated on a free speaking prompt-response style spoken language assessment test. Experiments show that the ensembles and the distilled model yield performance gains over a single model, and have the ability to detect outliers",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Language teachers often claim that the goal of speech training should be intelligible enough pronunciations, not native-sounding ones, because some types of accented pronunciations are intelligible or comprehensible enough. However, if one aims to provide a technical framework of automatic assessment based on intelligibility or comprehensibility, s/he has to be faced with a big technical challenge. That is collection of L2 utterances with annotations based on these metrics. Further, learners always want to know which parts (words, morphemes, or syllables) in their speech should be corrected. This means that data collection needs a valid method of intelligibility annotation with fine granularity. In our previous studies, a new metric of shadowability was introduced, and it was shown experimentally to be highly correlated to perceived intelligibility or comprehensibility as well as it was explained theoretically to be potential to give annotations with fine granularity. In this paper, shadowability annotation with fine granularity is examined experimentally, and a new and more valid method of collecting shadowing utterances is introduced. Finally, we tentatively derive frame-based shadowability annotation for L2 utterances",

    "abstract": "Learning to read is a prerequisite to participate in our knowledge society. Developing reading skills requires intensive practice with individual evaluation and guidance by teachers, which is not always feasible in traditional classroom instruction. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology could offer a solution, but so far it has been mostly used to follow children while reading and to provide correct word forms through text-to-speech technology. However, ASR could possibly be employed at earlier stages of learning to read when children are still in the process of developing decoding skills. Early evaluation through ASR and individualized feedback could help achieve more personalized and possibly more effective guidance, thus preventing reading problems and improving the process of reading development In this paper we report on an explorative study in which an ASR-based system equipped with logging capabilities was developed and employed to evaluate decoding skills in Dutch first graders reading aloud, and to provide them with detailed, individualized feedback. The results indicate that ASR-based feedback leads to improved reading accuracy and speed and that the log-files provide useful information to enhance practice and feedback, thus paving the way for more personalized, technology-enriched approaches to reading instruction",

    "abstract": "Perceptual evaluation of voice quality is widely used in laryngological practice, but it lacks reproducibility caused by inter- and intra-rater variability. This problem can be solved by automatic estimation of voice quality using machine learning. In the previous studies, conventional acoustic features, such as jitter, have often been employed as inputs. However, many of them are vulnerable to severe hoarseness because they assume a quasi-periodicity of voice. This paper investigated non-parametric features derived from amplitude and phase spectrograms. We applied the instantaneous phase correction proposed by Yatabe et al. (2018) to extract features that could be interpreted as indicators of non-sinusoidality. Specifically, we compared log amplitude, temporal phase variation, temporal complex value variation, and mel-scale versions of them. A deep neural network with a bidirectional GRU was constructed for each item of GRBAS Scale, a hoarseness evaluation method. The dataset was composed of 2545 samples of sustained vowel /a/ with the GRBAS scores labeled by an otolaryngologist. The results showed that the Hz-mel conversion improved the performance in almost all the case. The best scores were obtained when using temporal phase variation along the mel scale for Grade, Rough, Breathy, and Strained, and when using log mel amplitude for Asthenic",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue system is built by an autonomous agent which can be trained by reinforcement learning where the reward from environment is maximized. The agent is learned by updating the policy when the goal state is observed. However, in real world, the extrinsic reward is usually sparse or missing. The training efficiency is bounded. The system performance is degraded. It is challenging to tackle the issue of sample efficiency in sparse reward scenario for spoken dialogues. Accordingly, a dialogue agent needs additional information to update its policy even in the period when reward is absent in the environment. This paper presents a new dialogue agent which is learned by incorporating the intrinsic reward based on the information-theoretic approach via stochastic curiosity exploration. This agent encourages the exploration for future diversity based on a latent dynamic architecture which consists of encoder network, curiosity network, information network and policy network. The latent states and actions are drawn to predict stochastic transition for future. The curiosity learning are implemented with intrinsic reward in a metric of mutual information and prediction error in the predicted states and actions.

The model calculates prototype embeddings with real conversations between doctors and patients, learning from them and simulator-augmented dialogs more efficiently.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end model that directly converts speech into dialog acts without the deterministic transcription process. In the proposed model, the dialog act recognition network is conjunct with an acoustic-to-word ASR model at its latent layer before the softmax layer, which provides a distributed representation of word-level ASR decoding information. Then, the entire network is fine-tuned in an end-to-end manner. This allows for stable training as well as robustness against ASR errors.

The performance of SLU, however, can be adversely affected by automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors. In this paper, we exploit transfer learning in a Generative pre-trained Transformer (GPT) to jointly optimize ASR error correction and semantic labeling in terms of dialog act and slot-value for a given user's spoken response in the context of SD system (SDS). With the encoded ASR output and dialog history as context, a conditional generative model is trained to generate transcripts correction, dialog act, and slot-values successively. The proposed generation model is jointly optimized as a classification task, which utilizes the ground-truth and N-best hypotheses in a multi-task, discriminative learning. We evaluate its effectiveness on a public SD corpus used in the Second Dialog State Tracking Challenge. The results show that our generation model can achieve a relative word error rate reduction of 25.12% from that in the original ASR 1-best result, and a sentence error rate (SER) lower than the oracle result from the 10-best ASR hypotheses.

Both the residual signal of the linear acoustic echo cancellation system, and the output of the adaptive filter are adopted to form multiple streams for the Conv-TasNet, resulting in more effective echo suppression while keeping a lower latency of the whole system.

The proposed approach consists of the Wave-U-Net, an auxiliary encoder, and an attention network.

With the attention network, the echo can be effectively suppressed from the mixture. Experimental results on TIMIT dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods in terms of the echo return loss enhancement (ERLE) for the single-talk period and the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score for the double-talk period.

    "abstract": "Most end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems generate acoustic features autoregressively from left to right, which still suffer from two problems: 1) low efficiency during inference; 2) the limitation of \"exposure bias\". To overcome these shortcomings, this paper proposes a non-autoregressive speech synthesis model which is based on the transformer structure. During training, the ground truth of acoustic features is schedule masked. The decoder needs to predict the entire acoustic features by taking text and the masked ground truth. During inference, we just need a text as input, the network will predict the acoustic features in one step. Additionally, we decompose the decoding process into two stages so that the model can consider the information in the context. Given an input text embedding, we first generate coarse acoustic features, which focus on the meaning of sentences. Then, we fill in missing details of acoustic features by taking into account the text information and the coarse acoustic features. Experiments on a Chinese female corpus illustrate that our approach can achieve competitive results in speech naturalness relative to autoregressive model. Most importantly, our model speed up the acoustic features generation by 296× compared with the autoregressive model based on transformer structure",

This framework guarantees that the synthesized speech has similar speaker characteristics to original speech, and it also ensures the distinguishability between different speakers.

    "abstract": "To speed up the inference of neural speech synthesis, non-autoregressive models receive increasing attention recently. In non-autoregressive models, additional durations of text tokens are required to make a hard alignment between the encoder and the decoder. The duration-based alignment plays a crucial role since it controls the correspondence between text tokens and spectrum frames and determines the rhythm and speed of synthesized audio. To get better duration-based alignment and improve the quality of non-autoregressive speech synthesis, in this paper, we propose a novel neural alignment model named MoBoAligner. Given the pairs of the text and mel spectrum, MoBoAligner tries to identify the boundaries of text tokens in the given mel spectrum frames based on the token-frame similarity in the neural semantic space with an end-to-end framework. With these boundaries, durations can be extracted and used in the training of non-autoregressive TTS models. Compared with the duration extracted by TransformerTTS, MoBoAligner brings improvement for the non-autoregressive TTS model on MOS (3.74 comparing to FastSpeech's 3.44). Besides, MoBoAligner is task-specified and lightweight, which reduces the parameter number by 45% and the training time consuming by 30%",

To alleviate this problem, previous methods have used multiple language units, e.g., phonemes and characters, but required the units to be hard-aligned. In this paper, we propose a multi-input attention structure that simultaneously accepts multiple language units without alignments among them.

    "abstract": "Auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence models with attention mechanisms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks including speech synthesis. Training these models can be difficult. The standard approach guides a model with the reference output history during training. However during synthesis the generated output history must be used. This mismatch can impact performance. Several approaches have been proposed to handle this, normally by selectively using the generated output history. To make training stable, these approaches often require a heuristic schedule or an auxiliary classifier. This paper introduces attention forcing, which guides the model with the generated output history and reference attention. This approach reduces the training-evaluation mismatch without the need for a schedule or a classifier. Additionally, for standard training approaches, the frame rate is often reduced to prevent models from copying the output history. As attention forcing does not feed the reference output history to the model, it allows using a higher frame rate, which improves the speech quality. Finally, attention forcing allows the model to generate output sequences aligned with the references, which is important for some down-stream tasks such as training neural vocoders. Experiments show that attention forcing allows doubling the frame rate, and yields significant gain in speech quality",

    "abstract": "Accurate pronunciation is an essential requirement for text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Systems trained on raw text exhibit pronunciation errors in output speech due to ambiguous letter-to-sound relations. Without an intermediate phonemic representation, it is difficult to intervene and correct these errors. Retaining explicit control over pronunciation runs counter to the current drive toward end-to-end (E2E) TTS using sequence-to-sequence models. On the one hand, E2E TTS aims to eliminate manual intervention, especially expert skill such as phonemic transcription of words in a lexicon. On the other, a system making difficult-to-correct pronunciation errors is of little practical use. Some intervention is necessary. We explore the minimal amount of linguistic features required to correct pronunciation errors in an otherwise E2E TTS system that accepts graphemic input. We use representation-mixing: within each sequence the system accepts either graphemic and/or phonemic input. We quantify how little training data needs to be phonemically labelled — that is, how small a lexicon must be written — to ensure control over pronunciation. We find modest correction is possible with 500 phonemised word types from the LJ speech dataset but correction works best when the majority of word types are phonemised with syllable boundaries",

The quality of the enhanced signal depends on the reconstruction ability of the dictionaries. A geometric interpretation of these nonnegative matrices enables us to cast them as convex polyhedral cones in the positive orthant.

In speech enhancement and suppression for self-produced speech, body-conducted signals can be used as an acoustical clue since they are robust against external noise and include self-produced speech predominantly. We have previously developed a semi-supervised method taking an improved source modeling approach called the joint source modeling, which can capture a nonlinear correspondence of air- and body-conducted signals using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). This allows enhanced and suppressed air-conducted self-produced speech to be prevented from contaminating by the characteristics of body-conducted signals. However, our previous method employs a rank-1 spatial model, which is effective but difficult to consider in more practical situations. Furthermore, joint source modeling depends on the representation capability of NMF. As a result, enhancement and suppression performances are limited. To overcome these limitations, this paper employs a full-rank spatial model and proposes a joint source modeling of air- and body-conducted signals using a VAE, which has shown to represent source signals more accurately than NMF.

While some extensions to the diffuse field SCM recently have been presented, accurate modeling for real sound fields remains an open problem. In this paper, a method for estimating the SCM of reverberant speech is proposed, based on the selection of time-frequency bins dominated by reverberation. The method is data-based and estimates the SCM for a specific acoustic scene. It is therefore applicable to realistic reverberant fields. An application of the proposed method to optimal beamforming for speech enhancement is presented, using the plane wave density function in the spherical harmonics (SH) domain. It is shown that the use of the proposed SCM outperforms the commonly used diffuse field SCM, suggesting the method is more successful in capturing the statistics of the late part of the reverberation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech bandwidth extension aims to generate a wideband signal from a narrowband (low-band) input by predicting the missing high-frequency components. It is believed that the general knowledge about the speaker and phonetic content strengthens the prediction. In this paper, we propose to augment the low-band acoustic features with i-vector and phonetic posteriorgram (PPG), which represent speaker and phonetic content of the speech, respectively. We also propose a residual dual-path network (RDPN) as the core module to process the augmented features, which fully utilizes the utterance-level temporal continuity information and avoids gradient vanishing. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves 20.2% and 7.0% relative improvements over the best baseline in terms of log-spectral distortion (LSD) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), respectively. Furthermore, our method is 16 times more compact than the best baseline in terms of the number of parameters",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Bandwidth extension aims to reconstruct wideband speech signals from narrowband inputs to improve perceptual quality. Prior studies mostly perform bandwidth extension under the assumption that the narrowband signals are clean without noise. The use of such extension techniques is greatly limited in practice when signals are corrupted by noise. To alleviate such problem, we propose an end-to-end time-domain framework for noise-robust bandwidth extension, that jointly optimizes a mask-based speech enhancement and an ideal bandwidth extension module with multi-task learning. The proposed framework avoids decomposing the signals into magnitude and phase spectra, therefore, requires no phase estimation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 14.3% and 15.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in terms of perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and log-spectral distortion (LSD), respectively. Furthermore, our method is 3 times more compact than the best baseline in terms of the number of parameters",

    "abstract": "Audio super-resolution is a challenging task of recovering the missing high-resolution features from a low-resolution signal. To address this, generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been used to achieve promising results by training the mappings between magnitudes of the low and high-frequency components. However, phase information is not well-considered for waveform reconstruction in conventional methods. In this paper, we tackle the problem of music super-resolution and conduct a thorough investigation on the importance of phase for this task. We use GAN to predict the magnitudes of the high-frequency components. The corresponding phase information can be extracted using either a GAN-based waveform synthesis system or a modified Griffin-Lim algorithm. Experimental results show that phase information plays an important role in the improvement of the reconstructed music quality. Moreover, our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective evaluations",

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition is essential for obtaining emotional intelligence which affects the understanding of context and meaning of speech. The fundamental challenges of speech emotion recognition from a machine learning standpoint is to extract patterns which carry maximum correlation with the emotion information encoded in this signal, and to be as insensitive as possible to other types of information carried by speech. In this paper, a novel recurrent residual temporal context modelling framework is proposed. The framework includes mixture of multi-view attention smoothing and high dimensional feature projection for context expansion and learning feature representations. The framework is designed to be robust to changes in speaker and other distortions, and it provides state-of-the-art results for speech emotion recognition. Performance of the proposed approach is compared with a wide range of current architectures in a standard 4-class classification task on the widely used IEMOCAP corpus. A significant improvement of 4% unweighted accuracy over state-of-the-art systems is observed. Additionally, the attention vectors have been aligned with the input segments and plotted at two different attention levels to demonstrate the effectiveness",

However, representation learning is challenging due to much variability from speech emotion signals across diverse domains, such as gender, age, languages, and social cultural context. Many approaches focus on domain-invariant representation learning which loses the domain-specific knowledge and results in unsatisfactory speech emotion recognition across domains. In this paper, we propose an adaptive domain-aware representation learning that leverages the domain knowledge to extract domain aware features. The proposed approach applies attention model on frequency to embed the domain knowledge in the emotion representation space.

Previous speech emotion recognition research focuses mainly on recognizing the emotion label derived from the majority vote (hard label) of the speaker (i.e., producer) but not on recognizing per-rater's emotion perception. In this work, we propose a framework that integrates different viewpoints of emotion perception from other co-raters (exclude target rater) using soft and hard label learning to improve target rater's emotion perception recognition. Our methods achieve [3.97%, 1.48%] and [1.71%, 2.87%] improvement on average unweighted accuracy recall (UAR) on the three-class (low, middle, and high class) [valence, activation (arousal)] emotion recognition task for four different raters on the IEMOCAP and the NNIME databases, respectively. Further analyses show that learning from the soft label of co-raters provides the most robust accuracy even without obtaining the target rater's labels.

    "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition is essential for obtaining emotional intelligence which affects the understanding of context and meaning of speech. Harmonically structured vowel and consonant sounds add indexical and linguistic cues in spoken information. Previous research argued whether vowel sound cues were more important in carrying the emotional context from a psychological and linguistic point of view. Other research also claimed that emotion information could exist in small overlapping acoustic cues. However, these claims are not corroborated in computational speech emotion recognition systems. In this research, a convolution-based model and a long-short-term memory-based model, both using attention, are applied to investigate these theories of speech emotion on computational models. The role of acoustic context and word importance is demonstrated for the task of speech emotion recognition. The IEMOCAP corpus is evaluated by the proposed models, and 80.1% unweighted accuracy is achieved on pure acoustic data which is higher than current state-of-the-art models on this task. The phones and words are mapped to the attention vectors and it is seen that the vowel sounds are more important for defining emotion acoustic cues than the consonants, and the model can assign word importance based on acoustic context",

However, they were not sensitive to a change of the nuclear pitch accent placement. In a map task, the L1 French speakers increased the number of dispreferred variants for the allophonic contrast [ɪç] vs. [ɪk] in the word ending ⟨-ig⟩ when Mirabella used this variant. For the contrast [εː] vs. [eː] as a realization of stressed ⟨-ä-⟩, such a convergence effect was not found. Overall, the non-native speakers showed a similar degree of accommodative behavior towards Mirabella as the L1 German speakers. This suggests that incidental inductive learning through accommodation is possible. However, phenomena of the target language that deviate too radically from the native pattern seem to require more explicit training",

Spontaneous samples show the same syllabic typology and distribution, stress group length and duration, similar syllable ratios, and a regular rhythmic pattern in both Canadian varieties. The analysis of intensity of stressed syllables, however, suggested divergence of the datasets from both traditional description of French and from each other. Thus, intensity accompanies primary stress in Ontario but not in Quebec, and both varieties use intensity to mark secondary stress.

To give a quantitative analysis of prosodic characteristics, a context-elicited discourse completion task was conducted to collect genuine and mock (im)polite Mandarin utterances in both imperative and interrogative modes. Results revealed that prosodic features played roles in a complex way. Mock polite speech showed a higher maximum F and intensity, a wider range as well as a higher variability of F and intensity, a lower HNR, and a higher jitter than genuine polite speech, whereas mock impolite speech showed a lower mean/maximum F and intensity, a narrower range as well as a lower variability of F and intensity, a slower speech rate, a higher HNR, and lower jitter, shimmer and H1-H2 than genuine impolite speech. In the perceptual experiment, the lower identification rates on mock (im)politeness indicated that perceptual judgement was influenced by literal meanings. Politeness ratings further showed that mock (im)polite speech was less (im)polite than genuine (im)polite speech, suggesting a good correspondence between prosodic manifestations and perceived politeness.

Since SM developed from the Beijing dialect, their pronunciations were compared to the same Mandarin words produced by four Beijing female speakers. Regional Mandarin speakers successfully produced the four Mandarin lexical tones, but their productions varied from SM. Two crucial acoustic measures for Mandarin lexical tones, F0 (fundamental frequency) and duration values, were fitted into linear mixed-effects models on differences between regional and Beijing accents. Regional speakers had longer word duration and different F0 height when producing SM, resulting in variations in Mandarin lexical tones across the regional accents. These findings shed light on regional accent variations in Mandarin lexical tones and lay a foundation for deeper understanding of their impact on perception of accented Mandarin lexical tones by native (Beijing) Mandarin listeners",

When ensembling the proposed end-to-end model with the cascade architecture, even better performance was achieved. In addition to the potential of end-to-end SQA, the SpeechBERT can also be considered for many other spoken language understanding tasks just as BERT for many text processing tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In a spoken multiple-choice question answering (SMCQA) task, given a passage, a question, and multiple choices all in the form of speech, the machine needs to pick the correct choice to answer the question. While the audio could contain useful cues for SMCQA, usually only the auto-transcribed text is utilized in system development. Thanks to the large-scaled pre-trained language representation models, such as the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), systems with only auto-transcribed text can still achieve a certain level of performance. However, previous studies have evidenced that acoustic-level statistics can offset text inaccuracies caused by the automatic speech recognition systems or representation inadequacy lurking in word embedding generators, thereby making the SMCQA system robust. Along the line of research, this study concentrates on designing a BERT-based SMCQA framework, which not only inherits the advantages of contextualized language representations learned by BERT, but integrates the complementary acoustic-level information distilled from audio with the text-level information. Consequently, an audio-enriched BERT-based SMCQA framework is proposed. A series of experiments demonstrates remarkable improvements in accuracy over selected baselines and SOTA systems on a published Chinese SMCQA dataset",

To understand the process and enable new possibilities for intelligent robots, we designed a spoken-language acquisition task in which a software robot learns to fulfill its desire by correctly identifying and uttering the name of its preferred object from the given images, without relying on any labeled dataset. We propose an unsupervised vision-based focusing strategy and a pre-training approach based on sound-image grounding to boost the efficiency of reinforcement learning. These ideas are motivated by the introspection that human babies first observe the world and then try actions to realize their desires.

In previous studies, predicting the coming emotion only considered the context information from one single speaker. However, there are two sides of the speaker and listener in interlocutors, and their emotions are influenced by one another during the conversation. For this reason, we propose a dimensional emotion prediction model based on interactive information in conversation from both interlocutors. We investigate the effects of interactive information in four conversation situations on emotion prediction, in which emotional tendencies of interlocutors are consistent or inconsistent in both valence and arousal. The results showed that the proposed method performance better by considering the interactive context information than the ones considering one single side alone. The prediction result is affected by the conversation situations. In the situation interlocutors have consistent emotional tendency in valence and inconsistent tendency in arousal, the prediction performance of valence is the best. In the situation that interlocutors' emotional tendency is inconsistent in both valence and arousal, the prediction performance of arousal is the best",

However, ASV can be subjected to malicious attacks, which could compromise that security.

Meanwhile, other kinds of attacks, known as adversarial attacks, have become a threat to all kind of machine learning systems. Adversarial attacks introduce an imperceptible perturbation in the input signal that radically changes the behavior of the system. These attacks have been intensively studied in the image domain but less in the speech domain In this work, we investigate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art ASV systems to adversarial attacks. We consider a threat model consisting in adding a perturbation noise to the test waveform to alter the ASV decision.

Previous literature mainly uses adversarial attacks on spoofing countermeasures under a white-box scenario, where attackers could access all the information of the victim networks. Blackbox attacks would be a more serious threat than white-box attacks In this paper, our objective is to black-box attack spoofing countermeasures using adversarial examples with high transferability. We used MI-FGSM to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. We propose an iterative ensemble method (IEM) to further improve the transferability. Comparing with previous ensemble-based attacks, our proposed IEM method, combined with MI-FGSM, could effectively generate adversarial examples with higher transferability. In our experiments, we evaluated the attacks on four black-box networks. For each black-box model, we used the other three as a white-box ensemble to generate the adversarial examples. The proposed IEM with MI-FGSM improved attack success rate by 4–30% relative (depending on black-box model) w.r.t. the baseline logit ensemble.

Applying summarization schemes to spoken documents is more challenging, especially in situations involving human interactions, such as meetings. Here, utterances tend not to form complete sentences and sometimes contain little information. Moreover, speech disfluencies will be present as well as recognition errors for automated systems. For current attention-based sequence-to-sequence summarization systems, these additional challenges can yield a poor attention distribution over the spoken document words and utterances, impacting performance. In this work, we propose a multi-stage method based on a hierarchical encoder-decoder model to explicitly model utterance-level attention distribution at training time; and enforce diversity at inference time using a unigram diversity term. Furthermore, multitask learning tasks including dialogue act classification and extractive summarization are incorporated. The performance of the system is evaluated on the AMI meeting corpus.

    "abstract": "Disfluencies are prevalent in spontaneous speech, as shown in many studies of adult speech. Less is understood about children's speech, especially in pre-school children who are still developing their language skills. We present a novel dataset with annotated disfluencies of spontaneous explanations from 26 children (ages 5–8), interviewed twice over a year-long period. Our preliminary analysis reveals significant differences between children's speech in our corpus and adult spontaneous speech from two corpora (Switchboard and CallHome). Children have higher disfluency and filler rates, tend to use nasal filled pauses more frequently, and on average exhibit longer reparandums than repairs, in contrast to adult speakers. Despite the differences, an automatic disfluency detection system trained on adult (Switchboard) speech transcripts performs reasonably well on children's speech, achieving an F1 score that is 10% higher than the score on an adult out-of-domain dataset (CallHome)",

    "abstract": "Spoken intent detection has become a popular approach to interface with various smart devices with ease. However, such systems are limited to the preset list of intents-terms or commands, which restricts the quick customization of personal devices to new intents. This paper presents a few-shot spoken intent classification approach with task-agnostic representations via meta-learning paradigm. Specifically, we leverage the popular representation based meta-learning learning to build a task-agnostic representation of utterances, that then use a linear classifier for prediction. We evaluate three such approaches on our novel experimental protocol developed on two popular spoken intent classification datasets: Google Commands and the Fluent Speech Commands dataset. For a 5-shot (1-shot) classification of novel classes, the proposed framework provides an average classification accuracy of 88.6% (76.3%) on the Google Commands dataset, and 78.5% (64.2%) on the Fluent Speech Commands dataset.

    "abstract": "False triggers in voice assistants are unintended invocations of the assistant, which not only degrade the user experience but may also compromise privacy. False trigger mitigation (FTM) is a process to detect the false trigger events and respond appropriately to the user. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to the FTM problem by introducing a parallel ASR decoding process with a special language model trained from \"out-of-domain\" data sources. Such language model is complementary to the existing language model optimized for the assistant task. A bidirectional lattice RNN (Bi-LRNN) classifier trained from the lattices generated by the complementary language model shows a 38.34% relative reduction of the false trigger (FT) rate at the fixed rate of 0.4% false suppression (FS) of correct invocations, compared to the current Bi-LRNN model. In addition, we propose to train a parallel Bi-LRNN model based on the decoding lattices from both language models, and examine various ways of implementation. The resulting model leads to further reduction in the false trigger rate by 10.8%",

We also propose to incorporate a mutual information neural estimator into the domain adaptation network to retain speaker discriminative information.

We design a network that can extract a high-level embedding that contains information about each speaker's identity from a given mixture.

This paper shows that with several modifications to the x-vector system, DNN embeddings can be directly used for verification. The proposed modifications include: (1) a mask-pooling layer that augments the training samples by randomly masking the frame-level activations and then computing temporal statistics, (2) a sampling scheme that produces diverse training samples by randomly splicing several speech segments from each utterance, and (3) additional convolutional layers designed to reduce the temporal resolution to save computational cost.

    "abstract": "The effects of speaking-style variability on automatic speaker verification were investigated using the UCLA Speaker Variability database which comprises multiple speaking styles per speaker. An x-vector/PLDA (probabilistic linear discriminant analysis) system was trained with the SRE and Switchboard databases with standard augmentation techniques and evaluated with utterances from the UCLA database. The equal error rate (EER) was low when enrollment and test utterances were of the same style (e.g., 0.98% and 0.57% for read and conversational speech, respectively), but it increased substantially when styles were mismatched between enrollment and test utterances. For instance, when enrolled with conversation utterances, the EER increased to 3.03%, 2.96% and 22.12% when tested on read, narrative, and pet-directed speech, respectively. To reduce the effect of style mismatch, we propose an entropy-based variable frame rate technique to artificially generate style-normalized representations for PLDA adaptation. The proposed system significantly improved performance. In the aforementioned conditions, the EERs improved to 2.69% (conversation – read), 2.27% (conversation – narrative), and 18.75% (pet-directed – read). Overall, the proposed technique performed comparably to multi-style PLDA adaptation without the need for training data in different speaking styles per speaker",

This paper investigates how privacy-preserving learning can improve a speaker verification system, by enabling the use of privacy-sensitive speaker data to train an auxiliary classification model that predicts vocal characteristics of speakers. In particular, this paper explores the utility achieved by approaches which combine different federated learning and differential privacy mechanisms. These approaches make it possible to train a central model while protecting user privacy, with users' data remaining on their devices. Furthermore, they make learning on a large population of speakers possible, ensuring good coverage of speaker characteristics when training a model. The auxiliary model described here uses features extracted from phrases which trigger a speaker verification system. From these features, the model predicts speaker characteristic labels considered useful as side information. The knowledge of the auxiliary model is distilled into a speaker verification system using multi-task learning, with the side information labels predicted by this auxiliary model being the additional task. This approach results in a 6% relative improvement in equal error rate over a baseline system",

The state-of-the-art x-vector PLDA based speaker verification systems use a generative model based on probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) for computing the verification score. Recently, we had proposed a neural network approach for backend modeling in speaker verification called the neural PLDA (NPLDA) where the likelihood ratio score of the generative PLDA model is posed as a discriminative similarity function and the learnable parameters of the score function are optimized using a verification cost. In this paper, we extend this work to achieve joint optimization of the embedding neural network (x-vector network) with the NPLDA network in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion. This proposed end-to-end model is optimized directly from the acoustic features with a verification cost function and during testing, the model directly outputs the likelihood ratio score. With various experiments using the NIST speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) 2018 and 2019 datasets, we show that the proposed E2E model improves significantly over the x-vector PLDA baseline speaker verification system",

They convert speech input to text units in a single trainable Neural Network model. In ASR, many utterances contain rich named entities. Such named entities may be user or location specific and they are not seen during training. A single model makes it inflexible to utilize dynamic contextual information during inference. In this paper, we propose to train a context aware E2E model and allow the beam search to traverse into the context FST during inference. We also propose a simple method to adjust the cost discrepancy between the context FST and the base model. This algorithm is able to reduce the named entity utterance WER by 57% with little accuracy degradation on regular utterances. Although an E2E model does not need a pronunciation dictionary, it's interesting to make use of existing pronunciation knowledge to improve accuracy. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to map the rare entity words to common words via pronunciation and treat the mapped words as an alternative form to the original word during recognition. This algorithm further reduces the WER on the named entity utterances by another 31%",

We find that the AED model is indeed more context sensitive, but that the gap can be closed by adding self-attention to the CTC model.

In our approach, we first compute the frame level posterior probabilities of source samples using source model. Then, for each class, probabilities of this class are used to compute a mean vector, which we refer to as mean soft labels. During adaptation, these mean soft labels are used in a regularization term to train the target model.

By contrast, humans can listen to what they speak in real-time, and if there is a delay in hearing, they won't be able to continue speaking. In this work, we propose an incremental machine speech chain towards enabling machine to listen while speaking in real-time.

In this work, we address a direct phonetic context modeling for the hybrid Deep Neural Network (DNN)/HMM, that does not build on any phone clustering algorithm for the determination of the HMM state inventory. By performing different decompositions of the joint probability of the center phoneme state and its left and right contexts, we obtain a factorized network consisting of different components, trained jointly.

One among those is unavailability of large amounts of speech data from child speakers to develop automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems employing deep learning architectures. Using a limited amount of training data limits the power of the learned system. To overcome this issue, we have explored means to effectively make use of adults' speech data for training an ASR system. For that purpose, generative adversarial network (GAN) based voice conversion (VC) is exploited to modify the acoustic attributes of adults' speech making it perceptually similar to that of children's speech. The original and converted speech samples from adult speakers are then pooled together to learn the statistical model parameters. Significantly improved recognition rate for children's speech is noted due to VC-based data augmentation. To further enhance the recognition rate, a limited amount of children's speech data is also pooled into training. Large reduction in error rate is observed in this case as well. It is worth mentioning that GAN-based VC does not change the speaking-rate. To demonstrate the need to deal with speaking-rate differences we report the results of time-scale modification of children's speech test data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prosody Transfer (PT) is a technique that aims to use the prosody from a source audio as a reference while synthesising speech. Fine-grained PT aims at capturing prosodic aspects like rhythm, emphasis, melody, duration, and loudness, from a source audio at a very granular level and transferring them when synthesising speech in a different target speaker's voice. Current approaches for fine-grained PT suffer from source speaker leakage, where the synthesised speech has the voice identity of the source speaker as opposed to the target speaker. In order to mitigate this issue, they compromise on the quality of PT. In this paper, we propose CopyCat, a novel, many-to-many PT system that is robust to source speaker leakage, without using parallel data. We achieve this through a novel reference encoder architecture capable of capturing temporal prosodic representations which are robust to source speaker leakage. We compare CopyCat against a state-of-the-art fine-grained PT model through various subjective evaluations, where we show a relative improvement of 47% in the quality of prosody transfer and 14% in preserving the target speaker identity, while still maintaining the same naturalness",

Traditional methods for the detection of sentence stress and phrase boundaries rely on machine learning methods that model limited contextual information and account little for interaction between these two prosodic events. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical network modeling the contextual factors at the granularity of phoneme, syllable and word based on bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). Moreover, to account for the inherent connection between sentence stress and phrase boundaries, we perform a joint modeling of these two important prosodic events with a multitask learning framework (MTL) which shares common prosodic features. We evaluate the network performance based on Aix-Machine Readable Spoken English Corpus (Aix-MARSEC). Experimental results show our proposed method obtains the F1-measure of 90% for sentence stress detection and 91% for phrase boundary detection, which outperforms the baseline utilizing conditional random field (CRF) by about 4% and 9% respectively",

We proposed inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) as a way to perform the variational inference, thus providing flexible approximate posterior distribution. The proposed approach condition the text-to-speech system on speaker embeddings so that latent space represents the emotion as semantic characteristics. For representing the speaker, we extracted speaker embeddings from the x-vector based speaker recognition model trained on speech data from many speakers. To predict the vocoder features, we used the acoustic model conditioned on the textual features as well as on the speaker embedding. We transferred the expressivity by using the mean of the latent variables for each emotion to generate expressive speech in different speaker's voices for which no expressive speech data is available We compared the results obtained using flow-based variational inference with variational autoencoder as a baseline model. The performance measured by mean opinion score (MOS), speaker MOS, and expressive MOS shows that N-pair loss based deep metric learning along with IAF model improves the transfer of expressivity in the desired speaker's voice in synthesized speech",

The speaking-rate value, the ratio of the number of input phonemes to the length of input speech, is adopted in the proposed system to control the speaking speed. Furthermore, the proposed SCTTS system can control the speaking speed while retaining other speech attributes, such as the pitch, by adopting the global style token-based style encoder. The proposed SCTTS does not require any additional well-trained model or an external speech database to extract phoneme-level duration information and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. In addition, our listening tests on fast-, normal-, and slow-speed speech showed that the SCTTS can generate more natural speech than other phoneme duration control approaches which increase or decrease duration at the same rate for the entire sentence, especially in the case of slow-speed speech",

    "abstract": "Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAE) are a powerful representation learning framework that can discover discrete groups of features from a speech signal without supervision. Until now, the VQ-VAE architecture has previously modeled individual types of speech features, such as only phones or only F0. This paper introduces an important extension to VQ-VAE for learning F0-related suprasegmental information simultaneously along with traditional phone features. The proposed framework uses two encoders such that the F0 trajectory and speech waveform are both input to the system, therefore two separate codebooks are learned. We used a WaveRNN vocoder as the decoder component of VQ-VAE. Our speaker-independent VQ-VAE was trained with raw speech waveforms from multi-speaker Japanese speech databases. Experimental results show that the proposed extension reduces F0 distortion of reconstructed speech for all unseen test speakers, and results in significantly higher preference scores from a listening test. We additionally conducted experiments using single-speaker Mandarin speech to demonstrate advantages of our architecture in another language which relies heavily on F0",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent neural speech synthesis systems have gradually focused on the control of prosody to improve the quality of synthesized speech, but they rarely consider the variability of prosody and the correlation between prosody and semantics together. In this paper, a prosody learning mechanism is proposed to model the prosody of speech based on TTS system, where the prosody information of speech is extracted from the mel-spectrum by a prosody learner and combined with the phoneme sequence to reconstruct the mel-spectrum. Meanwhile, the semantic features of text from the pre-trained language model is introduced to improve the prosody prediction results. In addition, a novel self-attention structure, named as local attention, is proposed to lift this restriction of input text length, where the relative position information of the sequence is modeled by the relative position matrices so that the position encodings is no longer needed. Experiments on English and Mandarin show that speech with more satisfactory prosody has obtained in our model. Especially in Mandarin synthesis, our proposed model outperforms baseline model with a MOS gap of 0.08, and the overall naturalness of the synthesized speech has been significantly improved",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a method of extracting coarse prosodic structure from fundamental frequency (F ) contours by using a discriminative approach such as deep neural networks (DNN), and applies the method for the parameter estimation of the Fujisaki model. In the conventional methods for the parameter estimation of the Fujisaki model, generative approaches, in which the estimation is treated as an inverse problem of the generation process, have been adopted. On the other hand, recent development of the discriminative approaches would enable us to treat the problem in a direct manner. To introduce a discriminative approach to the parameter estimation of the Fujisaki model in which the precise labels for the parameter are expensive, this study focuses on the similarities between the acoustic realization of the prosodic structure in F contours and the sentence structure of the read text. In the proposed method, the sentence structure obtained from the text is utilized as the labels for the discriminative model, and the model estimates the coarse prosodic structure. Finally this structure is refined by using a conventional method for the parameter estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the estimation accuracy by 18% in terms of detection rate without using any auxiliary features at inference",

In this work, we train a sequence-to-sequence neural network conditioned on acoustic speech features to learn a latent prosody space with intuitive and meaningful dimensions. Experiments show that a model conditioned on sentence-wise pitch, pitch range, phone duration, energy, and spectral tilt can effectively control each prosodic dimension and generate a wide variety of speaking styles, while maintaining similar mean opinion score (4.23) to our Tacotron baseline (4.26)",

We address these limitations with a user-controllable, context-aware neural prosody generator. Given a real or synthesized speech recording, our model allows a user to input prosody constraints for certain time frames and generates the remaining time frames from input text and contextual prosody.

To achieve this, the system includes a style extraction model that extracts a style embedding from the speech query, which is then used by the TTS to produce a matching response. We faced two main challenges: 1) only a small portion of the TTS training dataset has style labels, which is needed to train a multi-style TTS that respects different style embeddings during inference. 2) The TTS system and the style extraction model have disjoint training datasets. We need consistent style labels across these two datasets so that the TTS can learn to respect the labels produced by the style extraction model during inference. To solve these, we adopted a semi-supervised approach that uses the style extraction model to create style labels for the TTS dataset and applied transfer learning to learn the style embedding jointly. Our experiment results show user preference for the styled TTS responses and demonstrate the style-embedded TTS system's capability of mimicking the speech query style",

Then, 16 experienced raters conducted discourse-based prosodic analysis on unconstrained speech collected at the beginning and the end of the intervention. A series of mixed-effect model analyses were conducted on learner effort, improvement and learner background to investigate their relationship with accentedness and comprehensibility. The results indicated that present MAPT prosody interventions were effective for comprehensibility but not accentedness, however, learner effort on lexical stress and prominence exhibit differing patterns. Similar to previous findings, learner age impacts production more than the length of residency or history of language study.

Assessment of SSD has been relying largely on trained speech and language pathologists (SLPs). With the increasing demand for and long-lasting shortage of SLPs, automated assessment of speech disorder becomes a highly desirable approach to assisting clinical work. This paper describes a study on automatic detection of phonological errors in Cantonese speech of kindergarten children, based on a newly collected large speech corpus. The proposed approach to speech error detection involves the use of a Siamese recurrent autoencoder, which is trained to learn the similarity and discrepancy between phone segments in the embedding space. Training of the model requires only speech data from typically developing (TD) children. To distinguish disordered speech from typical one, cosine distance between the embeddings of the test segment and the reference segment is computed. Different model architectures and training strategies are experimented. Results on detecting the 6 most common consonant errors demonstrate satisfactory performance of the proposed model, with the average precision value from 0.82 to 0.93",

We carefully selected 273 English utterances from a speech database produced by both native speakers and Mandarin child learners, and measured the rhythmic correlates. Results suggested that vowel-related metrics (e.g. nPVI) are better indexes for L2 rhythmic evaluation, which is similar for ESL adults; pause-related fluency is another indication for prosodic assessment, especially for child ESL learners.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prior research has revealed that L1-Mandarin learners employed position-dependent repair strategies for European Portuguese /l/ and /ɾ/. In this study we examined whether this L2 prosodic effect can be attributed to a cross-linguistic influence and whether the replacement of the Portuguese rhotic by the Mandarin [ɹ] is due to perception or orthography. We performed a delayed imitation task with naïve Mandarin listeners and manipulated the presented input types (auditory form alone or a combination of auditory and written forms). Results showed that naïve responses were reminiscent of L1-Mandarin learners' behaviour, and that [ɹ] was used almost exclusively in the presence of written input, suggesting that the prosodic effect attested in L2 acquisition of European Portuguese /l/ and /ɾ/ stems from cross-linguistic interaction between phonological categorization and orthography",

    "abstract": "This study investigated the cross-linguistic perception of attitudinal intonation with willingness and reluctance in Mandarin by Korean L2 learners. In the current study, 20 Korean L2 learners of Mandarin (KL2) and 20 native Mandarin listeners (CL1) were instructed to rate perceived degree of willingness (1–5 Likert scale) from the utterances (with willingness, reluctance, and neutrality) produced by 2 native Mandarin speakers (one male and one female). The rating results showed that 1) the rating scores of willing attitude were significantly higher than those of reluctant attitude by KL2; 2) utterances of willingness and neutrality tend to be perceived less willing by KL2 than by CL1; 3) KL2 had a narrower rating range on the perception of attitudinal intonation than CL1. Specifically, Korean females had a wider rating range than Korean males. The findings indicated that 1) utterances of willingness, neutrality, and reluctance in Mandarin were accurately perceived by KL2; 2) willingness carried by attitudinal intonation was weakened through L2 pragmatic comprehension by KL2; 3) Korean females were more sensitive than Korean males on the perception of attitudinal intonation. The overall results suggest significant effects of language experience and gender difference on the perception of Chinese utterances with willingness and reluctance",

Next, the memory block is built with an extensive set of noise feature vectors as the prior noise bases. Finally, the attention block serves as an auxiliary network to improve the noise awareness of the main network by encoding the dynamic noise information at frame level through additional features obtained by weighing the existing noise basis vectors in the memory block.

While a number of speech enhancement frameworks have been proposed in the literature that exploit AV cues, there are no visual speech corpora recorded in real environments with a sufficient variety of speakers, to enable evaluation of AV frameworks' generalisation capability in a wide range of background visual and acoustic noises.

    "abstract": "This work proposes a novel approach for reducing the computational complexity of speech denoising neural networks by using a sparsely active ensemble topology. In our ensemble networks, a gating module classifies an input noisy speech signal either by identifying speaker gender or by estimating signal degradation, and exclusively assigns it to a best-case specialist module, optimized to denoise a particular subset of the training data. This approach extends the hypothesis that speech denoising can be simplified if it is split into non-overlapping subproblems, contrasting earlier approaches that train large generalist neural networks to address a wide range of noisy speech data. We compare a baseline recurrent network against an ensemble of similarly designed, but smaller networks. Each network module is trained independently and combined to form a naïve ensemble. This can be further fine-tuned using a sparsity parameter to improve performance. Our experiments on noisy speech data — generated by mixing LibriSpeech and MUSAN datasets — demonstrate that a fine-tuned sparsely active ensemble can outperform a generalist using significantly fewer calculations. The key insight of this paper, leveraging model selection as a form of network compression, may be used to supplement already-existing deep learning methods for speech denoising",

The technique derives inspiration from speech separation techniques that use TCN based separator between a single layer encoder-decoder. We propose to use a multilayer encoder-decoder to obtain a noise-independent representation useful for separating clean speech and noise. We present t-SNE-based analysis of the representation learned using different architectures for selecting the optimal number of encoder-decoder layers. We evaluate the proposed architectures using an objective measure of speech quality, scale-invariant source-to-noise ratio, and by obtaining word error rate on a speech recognition platform.

    "abstract": "Monaural speech dereverberation is a very challenging task because no spatial cues can be used. When the additive noises exist, this task becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose a joint training method for simultaneous speech denoising and dereverberation using deep embedding representations. Firstly, at the denoising stage, the deep clustering (DC) network is used to extract noise-free deep embedding representations from the anechoic speech and residual reverberation signals. These deep embedding representations are represent the inferred spectral masking patterns of the desired signals so that they could discriminate the anechoic speech and the reverberant signals very well. Secondly, at the dereverberation stage, we utilize another supervised neural network to estimate the mask of anechoic speech from these deep embedding representations. Finally, the joint training algorithm is used to train the speech denoising and dereverberation network. Therefore, the noise reduction and dereverberation can be simultaneously optimized. Our experiments are conducted on the TIMIT dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the WPE and BLSTM baselines. Especially in the low SNR (-5 dB) condition, our proposed method produces a relative improvement of 7.8% for PESQ compared with BLSTM method and relative reductions of 16.3% and 19.3% for CD and LLR measures",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper describes multichannel speech enhancement based on a probabilistic model of complex source spectrograms for improving the intelligibility of speech corrupted by undesired noise. The univariate complex Gaussian model with the reproductive property supports the additivity of source complex spectrograms and forms the theoretical basis of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Multichannel NMF (MNMF) is an extension of NMF based on the multivariate complex Gaussian model with spatial covariance matrices (SCMs), and its state-of-the-art variant called FastMNMF with jointly-diagonalizable SCMs achieves faster decomposition based on the univariate Gaussian model in the transformed domain where all time-frequency-channel elements are independent. Although a heavy-tailed extension of FastMNMF has been proposed to improve the robustness against impulsive noise, the source additivity has never been considered. The multivariate α-stable distribution does not have the reproductive property for the shape matrix parameter. This paper, therefore, proposes a heavy-tailed extension called α-stable FastMNMF which works in the transformed domain to use a univariate complex α-stable model, satisfying the reproductive property for any tail lightness parameter α and allowing the α-fractional Wiener filtering based on the element-wise source additivity. The experimental results show that α-stable FastMNMF with α = 1.8 significantly outperforms Gaussian FastMNMF (α=2)",

These constraints are particularly apparent when attempting to deploy deep learning models, as they require substantial amounts of memory and data movement operations. Herein, we test the suitability of pruning and quantisation as two methods to compress the overall size of neural networks trained for a health-driven speech classification task. Key results presented on the Upper Respiratory Tract Infection Corpus indicate that pruning, then quantising a network can reduce the number of operational weights by almost 90%.

This paper addresses the generalizability issue by proposing multiple adaptation strategies that update pre-trained models based on a dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) framework, which improve depression detection performance in both clean and naturalistic environments. Experimental results on two depression corpora show that feature representations in CNN layers need to be adapted to accommodate environmental changes, and that increases in data quantity and quality are helpful for pre-training models for adaptation.

In this challenge, teams were asked to train a regression model to predict sleepiness from samples of the Düsseldorf Sleepy Language Corpus (DSLC). This challenge was notable because the performance of all entrants was uniformly poor, with even the winning system only achieving a correlation of r=0.37. We look at whether the task itself is achievable, and whether the corpus is suited to training a machine learning system for the task. We perform a listening experiment using samples from the corpus and show that a group of human listeners can achieve a correlation of r=0.7 on this task, although this is mainly by classifying the recordings into one of three sleepiness groups. We show that the corpus, because of its construction, confounds variation with sleepiness and variation with speaker identity, and this was the reason that machine learning systems failed to perform well. We conclude that sleepiness rating prediction from voice is not an impossible task, but that good performance requires more information about sleepy speech and its variability across listeners than is available in the DSLC corpus",

The aim of this study was to characterize tongue and lip movements during speech produced by individuals who have had a laryngectomy. EMA (electromagnetic articulography) was used to derive movement data from the tongue and lips of nine speakers (four alaryngeal and five typical). The kinematic metrics included movement duration, range, speed, and cumulative path distance. We also used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify alaryngeal and healthy speech movement patterns. Our preliminary results indicated that alaryngeal articulation is longer in duration than healthy speakers. Alaryngeal speakers also use larger lateral tongue movements and move the tongue back at a slower speed than healthy speakers. The results from the SVM model also indicates that alaryngeal articulatory movement patterns are distinct from healthy speakers. Taken together, these findings suggest that there are differences in articulatory behavior that occur after the removal of the larynx. It may be helpful to consider the distinct articulatory motion patterns of alaryngeal speech in clinical practice and in the development of technologies (e.g., silent speech interfaces) that assist to provide an intelligible form of speech for this patient population",

The main reason is the lack of suitable training data to accommodate for the large mismatch seen between dysarthric and typical speech. Only recently has focus moved from single-word tasks to exploring continuous speech ASR needed for dictation and most voice-enabled interfaces. This paper investigates improvements to dysarthric continuous ASR. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using unsupervised autoencoder-based bottleneck (AE-BN) feature extractor trained on out-of-domain (OOD) LibriSpeech data. We further explore multi-task optimisation techniques shown to benefit typical speech ASR. We propose a 5-fold cross-training setup on the widely used TORGO dysarthric database. A setup we believe is more suitable for this low-resource data domain. Results show that adding the proposed AE-BN features achieves an average absolute (word error rate) WER improvement of 2.63% compared to the baseline system. A further reduction of 2.33% and 0.65% absolute WER is seen when applying monophone regularisation and joint optimisation techniques, respectively.

In this work, we propose a data-driven approach to learn representations from raw speech waveform. Our model comprises of 1-D CNN layer to extract representations from raw speech followed by BLSTM layers for the classification tasks. We consider 3 different classification tasks (ALS vs HC), (PD vs HC), and (ALS vs PD). We perform each classification task using four different speech stimuli in two scenarios: i) trained and tested in a stimulus-specific manner, ii) trained on data pooled from all stimuli, and test on each stimulus separately. Experiments with 60 ALS, 60 PD, and 60 HC show that the frequency responses of the learned 1-D CNN filters are low pass in nature, and the center frequencies lie below 1kHz. The learned representations form raw speech perform better than MFCC which is considered as baseline. Experiments with pooled models yield a better result compared to the task-specific models",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. As the disease progresses, patients alternate periods in which motor symptoms are mitigated due to medication intake (ON state) and periods with motor complications (OFF state). The time that patients spend in the OFF condition is currently the main parameter employed to assess pharmacological interventions and to evaluate the efficacy of different active principles. In this work, we present a system that combines automatic speech processing and deep learning techniques to classify the medication state of PD patients by leveraging personal speech-based bio-markers. We devise a speaker-dependent approach and investigate the relevance of different acoustic-prosodic feature sets. Results show an accuracy of 90.54% in a test task with mixed speech and an accuracy of 95.27% in a semi-spontaneous speech task. Overall, the experimental assessment shows the potentials of this approach towards the development of reliable, remote daily monitoring and scheduling of medication intake of PD patients",

The objective of this challenge is to distinguish arbitrarily audio files from bona fide or spoofing attacks, where spoofing attacking includes replay attacks, text-to-speech and voice conversions. Our replay detection system is a pipeline system with three aspects: feature engineering, DNN models, and score fusion. Firstly, logspec is extracted as input features according to previous research works where spectrum augmentation is applied during training stage to boost performance under limited training data. Secondly, DNN models part includes three major models: SEnet, DenseNet, and our proposed model, channel consistency DenseNeXt, where binary cross entropy loss and center loss are applied as training objectives. Finally, score fusion is applied to all three DNN models in order to obtain primary system results. The experiment results show that for our best single system, channel consistency DenseNeXt, t-DCF and EER are 0.0137 and 0.46% on physical access evaluation set respectively. The performance of primary system obtains 0.00785 and 0.282% in terms of t-DCF and EER respectively.

In this paper, a novel model for audio quality assessment is proposed by jointly using bidirectional long short-term memory and an attention mechanism. The former is to mimic a human auditory perception ability to learn information from a recording, and the latter is to further discriminate interferences from desired signals by highlighting target related features. To evaluate our proposed approach, the TIMIT dataset is used and augmented by mixing with various natural sounds. In our experiments, two tasks are explored. The first task is to predict an utterance quality score, and the second is to identify where an anomalous distortion takes place in a recording.

Through unsupervised exploratory data analysis, we explore the characteristics of the degradations.

They are increasingly used for a variety of tasks ranging from information retrieval to unsupervised term discovery and speech segmentation. However, there is currently no clear methodology to compare or optimize the quality of these embeddings in a task-neutral way. Here, we systematically compare two popular metrics, ABX discrimination and Mean Average Precision (MAP), on 5 languages across 17 embedding methods, ranging from supervised to fully unsupervised, and using different loss functions (autoencoders, correspondance autoencoders, siamese). Then we use the ABX and MAP to predict performances on a new downstream task: the unsupervised estimation of the frequencies of speech segments in a given corpus. We find that overall, ABX and MAP correlate with one another and with frequency estimation. However, substantial discrepancies appear in the fine-grained distinctions across languages and/or embedding methods. This makes it unrealistic at present to propose a task-independent silver bullet method for computing the intrinsic quality of speech embeddings.

    "abstract": "Although speech recognition technology for cochlear implants has continued to improve, music accessibility remains a challenge. Previous studies have shown that cochlear implant users may prefer listening to music that has been reengineered to be less complex. In this paper, we consider the combined effect of spectral complexity reduction and number of instruments playing on musical enjoyment with cochlear implants. Nine normal hearing listeners rated 200 10-second music samples on three enjoyment modalities (musicality, pleasantness, and naturalness) with and without the use of cochlear implant simulation. The music samples included 20 versions of the song \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\" synthesized using one of five different instruments and with one to four instruments playing at once. The remaining 180 versions were created by reducing each sample's spectral complexity to nine different levels using principal component analysis. The results showed a preference for less amounts of spectral complexity reduction for samples without cochlear implant simulation (P<.001), as well as a preference for fewer instruments for samples with cochlear implant simulation (P<.001). However, spectral complexity reduction was not a significant factor for samples with cochlear implant simulation, and a significant interaction effect between spectral complexity reduction and number of instruments was not found",

We accomplish this by wrapping local observations in a linear code and intentionally applying symbol errors prior to transmission. If many nodes join a distributed speech enhancement task, a proportional number of symbol errors are introduced into the aggregated code leading to decoding failure if the code's predefined symbol error limit is exceeded",

While improvements in technology and data protection regulations have been made to provide users a more secure experience, the concept of privacy continues to be subject to enormous challenges. We can observe that people intuitively adjust their way of talking in a human-to-human conversation, an intuition that devices could benefit from to increase their level of privacy. In order to enable devices to quantify privacy in an acoustic scenario, this paper focuses on how people perceive privacy with respect to environmental noise. We measured privacy scores on a crowdsourcing platform with a paired comparison listening test and obtained reliable and consistent results. Our measurements show that the experience of privacy varies depending on the acoustic features of the ambient noise. Furthermore, multiple probabilistic choice models were fitted to the data to obtain a meaningful ordering of noise scenarios conveying listeners' preferences.

We showed that steganography models proposed for vision are less suitable for speech, and propose a new model that includes the short-time Fourier transform and inverse-short-time Fourier transform as differentiable layers within the network, thus imposing a vital constraint on the network outputs. We empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing to deep learning based on several speech datasets and analyzed the results quantitatively and qualitatively. Moreover, we showed that the proposed approach could be applied to conceal multiple messages in a single carrier using multiple decoders or a single conditional decoder.

The increasing number of sophisticated, quasi imperceptible attacks raises the question of countermeasures In this paper, we focus on hybrid ASR systems and compare four acoustic models regarding their ability to indicate uncertainty under attack: a feed-forward neural network and three neural networks specifically designed for uncertainty quantification, namely a Bayesian neural network, Monte Carlo dropout, and a deep ensemble We employ uncertainty measures of the acoustic model to construct a simple one-class classification model for assessing whether inputs are benign or adversarial. Based on this approach, we are able to detect adversarial examples with an area under the receiving operator curve score of more than 0.99.

In this paper, we derive formal privacy guarantees for general text transformation-based de-identification methods on the basis of Differential Privacy We also measure the effect that different ways of masking private information in dialog transcripts have on a subsequent machine learning task. To this end, we formulate different masking strategies and compare their privacy-utility trade-offs.

Nonetheless, their data-hungry property and the mispronunciation of converted speech make seq2seq models far from practical.

While nonparallel VC frameworks have already been studied widely, the conventional frameworks require huge background knowledge or plenty of training utterances. This is because of difficulty in disentanglement of linguistic and speaker information without a large amount of data. This work tackles the problem by utilizing NMF, which can factorize acoustic features into time-variant and time-invariant components in an unsupervised manner. To preserve linguistic consistency between source and target speakers, the proposed method performs soft alignment between the acoustic features of the source speaker and the exemplars of the target speaker. The method adopts the alignment technique of INCA algorithm, which is an iterative method to obtain alignment of nonparallel corpora. The results of subjective experiments showed that the proposed framework outperformed not only the NMF-based parallel VC framework but also the CycleGAN-based nonparallel VC framework. The results also showed that the proposed method achieved high-quality conversion even if the number of training utterances for the source speaker was extremely limited",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Voice conversion (VC) is a task that transforms the source speaker's timbre, accent, and tones in audio into another one's while preserving the linguistic content. It is still a challenging work, especially in a one-shot setting. Auto-encoder-based VC methods disentangle the speaker and the content in input speech without explicit information about the speaker's identity, so these methods can further generalize to unseen speakers. The disentangle capability is achieved by vector quantization (VQ), adversarial training, or instance normalization (IN). However, the imperfect disentanglement may harm the quality of output speech. In this work, to further improve audio quality, we use the U-Net architecture within an auto-encoder-based VC system. We find that to leverage the U-Net architecture, a strong information bottleneck is necessary. The VQ-based method, which quantizes the latent vectors, can serve the purpose. The objective and the subjective evaluations show that the proposed method performs well in both audio naturalness and speaker similarity",

    "abstract": "End-to-end speech synthesis can reach high quality and naturalness with low-resource adaptation data. However, the generalization of out-domain texts and the improving modeling accuracy of speaker representations are still challenging tasks. The limited adaptation data leads to unacceptable errors and low similarity of the synthetic speech. In this paper, both speaker representations modeling and acoustic model structure are improved for the speaker adaptation task. On the one hand, compared with the conventional methods that focused on using fixed global speaker representations, the attention gating is proposed to adjust speaker representations dynamically based on the attended context and prosody information, which can describe more pronunciation characteristics in phoneme level. On the other hand, to improve the robustness and avoid over-fitting, the decoder model is factored into average-net and adaptation-net, which are designed for learning speaker independent acoustic features and target speaker timbre imitation respectively. And the context discriminator is pre-trained by large ASR data to supervise the average-net generating proper speaker independent acoustic features for different phoneme. Experimental results on Mandarin dataset show that proposed methods lead to an improvement on intelligibility, naturalness and similarity",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning from high-resource languages is known to be an efficient way to improve end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages. Pre-trained or jointly trained encoder-decoder models, however, do not share the language modeling (decoder) for the same language, which is likely to be inefficient for distant target languages. We introduce speech-to-text translation (ST) as an auxiliary task to incorporate additional knowledge of the target language and enable transferring from that target language. Specifically, we first translate high-resource ASR transcripts into a target low-resource language, with which a ST model is trained. Both ST and target ASR share the same attention-based encoder-decoder architecture and vocabulary. The former task then provides a fully pre-trained model for the latter, bringing up to 24.6% word error rate (WER) reduction to the baseline (direct transfer from high-resource ASR). We show that training ST with human translations is not necessary. ST trained with machine translation (MT) pseudo-labels brings consistent gains. It can even outperform those using human labels when transferred to target ASR by leveraging only 500K MT examples. Even with pseudo-labels from low-resource MT (200K examples), ST-enhanced transfer brings up to 8.9% WER reduction to direct transfer",

Such a system is beneficial when training data for a target language is limited. Lattice-Free Maximum Mutual Information (LF-MMI) training performs sequence discrimination by introducing competing hypotheses through a denominator graph in the cost function. The standard approach to train a multilingual model with LF-MMI is to combine the acoustic units from all languages and use a common denominator graph. The resulting model is either used as a feature extractor to train an acoustic model for the target language or directly fine-tuned. In this work, we propose a scalable approach to train the multilingual acoustic model using a typical multitask network for the LF-MMI framework. A set of language-dependent denominator graphs is used to compute the cost function. The proposed approach is evaluated under typical multilingual ASR tasks using GlobalPhone and BABEL datasets.

Recently developed machine learning systems rely on audio features for classification; however, research in other fields has shown that audio-video cross-modal frameworks can improve classification accuracy while simultaneously reducing the amount of training data required compared to uni-modal systems (i.e. audio- or video-only) In this paper, we propose an audio-video cross-modal deep learning framework that takes both audio and video data as input to classify dysarthria severity levels.

    "title": "Dysarthric Speech Recognition Based on Deep Metric Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present in this paper an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system for a person with an articulation disorder resulting from athetoid cerebral palsy. Because their utterances are often unstable or unclear, speech recognition systems have difficulty recognizing the speech of those with this disorder. For example, their speech styles often fluctuate greatly even when they are repeating the same sentences. For this reason, their speech tends to have great variation even within recognition classes. To alleviate this intra-class variation problem, we propose an ASR system based on deep metric learning. This system learns an embedded representation that is characterized by a small distance between input utterances of the same class, while the distance of the input utterances of different classes is large. Therefore, our method makes it easy for the ASR system to distinguish dysarthric speech. Experimental results show that our proposed approach using deep metric learning improves the word-recognition accuracy consistently. Moreover, we also evaluate the combination of our proposed method and transfer learning from unimpaired speech to alleviate the low-resource problem associated with impaired speech",

    "title": "Automatic Glottis Detection and Segmentation in Stroboscopic Videos Using Convolutional Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Laryngeal videostroboscopy is widely used for the analysis of glottal vibration patterns. This analysis plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of voice disorders. It is essential to study these patterns using automatic glottis segmentation methods to avoid subjectiveness in diagnosis. Glottis detection is an essential step before glottis segmentation. This paper considers the problem of automatic glottis segmentation using U-Net based deep convolutional networks. For accurate glottis detection, we train a fully convolutional network with a large amount of glottal and non-glottal images. In glottis segmentation, we consider U-Net with three different weight initialization schemes: 1) Random weight Initialization (RI), 2) Detection Network weight Initialization (DNI) and 3) Detection Network encoder frozen weight Initialization (DNIFr), using two different architectures: 1) U-Net without skip connection (UWSC) 2) U-Net with skip connection (USC). Experiments with 22 subjects' data reveal that the performance of glottis segmentation network can be increased by initializing its weights using those of the glottis detection network. Among all schemes, when DNI is used, the USC yields an average localization accuracy of 81.3% and a Dice score of 0.73, which are better than those from the baseline approach by 15.87% and 0.07 (absolute), respectively",

    "title": "Acoustic Feature Extraction with Interpretable Deep Neural Network for Neurodegenerative Related Disorder Classification",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Speech-based automatic approaches for detecting neurodegenerative disorders (ND) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have received more attention recently due to being non-invasive and potentially more sensitive than current pen-and-paper tests. The performance of such systems is highly dependent on the choice of features in the classification pipeline. In particular for acoustic features, arriving at a consensus for a best feature set has proven challenging. This paper explores using deep neural network for extracting features directly from the speech signal as a solution to this. Compared with hand-crafted features, more information is present in the raw waveform, but the feature extraction process becomes more complex and less interpretable which is often undesirable in medical domains. Using a SincNet as a first layer allows for some analysis of learned features. We propose and evaluate the Sinc-CLA (with SincNet, Convolutional, Long Short-Term Memory and Attention layers) as a task-driven acoustic feature extractor for classifying MCI, ND and healthy controls (HC). Experiments are carried out on an in-house dataset. Compared with the popular hand-crafted feature sets, the learned task-driven features achieve a superior classification accuracy. The filters of the SincNet is inspected and acoustic differences between HC, MCI and ND are found",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic presents global challenges transcending boundaries of country, race, religion, and economy. The current gold standard method for COVID-19 detection is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. However, this method is expensive, time-consuming, and violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application. The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving, the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based technology solutions for point-of-care diagnosis of respiratory infection, and in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the articulatory phenotypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's disease (PD) using a novel acoustic-based framework that assesses five key components of motor performance: Coordination, Consistency, Speed, Precision, and Rate. The use of interpretable, hypothesis-driven features has the potential to inform impairment-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) models and improve classification algorithms for disorders with divergent articulatory profiles. Acoustic features were extracted from audio recordings of 18 healthy controls, 18 participants with ALS, and 18 participants with PD producing syllable sequences. Results revealed significantly different articulatory phenotypes for each disorder group. Upon stratification into Early Stage and Late Stage in disease progression, results from individual receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision tree analyses showed high diagnostic accuracy for impaired Coordination in the Early Stage and impaired Rate in the Late Stage. With additional research, articulatory phenotypes characterized using this framework may lead to advancements in ASR for dysarthric speech and diagnostic accuracy at different disease stages for individuals with distinct articulatory deficits",

People with dysarthria may lose their ability to produce intelligible and audible speech sounds which in time may affect their way of conveying emotions, that are mostly expressed using nonverbal signals. Recent research shows some promise on automatically recognising the verbal part of dysarthric speech. However, this is the first study that investigates the ability to automatically recognise the nonverbal part. A parallel database of dysarthric and typical emotional speech is collected, and approaches to discriminating between emotions using models trained on either dysarthric (speaker dependent, matched) or typical (speaker independent, unmatched) speech are investigated for four speakers with dysarthria caused by cerebral palsy and Parkinson's disease. Promising results are achieved in both scenarios using SVM classifiers, opening new doors to improved, more expressive voice input communication aids",
