    "abstract": "Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an im- age from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I transla- tion, such as in image super-resolution, extends this con- cept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denois- ing Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual- approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse pro- cess) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive exper- iments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and supe- rior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of im- age quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

    "abstract": "As machine learning become more pervasive and data privacy regulations evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of datasets verify the efficacy of our method",

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on static environments or isolated robot actions, DynScene decomposes the generation into two phases static scene synthesis and action trajectory generation allowing fine-grained control and diversity. Our model enhances realism and physical feasibility through scene refinement (layout sampling, quaternion quantization) and leverages residual action representation to enable action augmentation, generating multiple diverse trajectories from a single static configuration. Experiments show DynScene achieves 26.8x faster generation, 1.84x higher accuracy, and 28% greater action diversity than human-crafted data.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We address the task of generating 3D hair geometry from a single image, which is challenging due to the diversity of hairstyles and the lack of paired image-to-3D hair data. Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data and cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional intermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings, that require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These approaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are limited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we propose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair dataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a pretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide strands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of complex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like afro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time. Data and code is available at https://radualexandru.github.io/difflocks",

    "abstract": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an intriguing open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention. Given a dataset that includes both labelled and unlabelled images, GCD aims to categorize all images in the unlabelled subset, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. In GCD, the common practice typically involves applying a spherical projection operator at the end of the self-supervised pretrained backbone, operating within Euclidean or spherical space. However, both of these spaces have been shown to be suboptimal for encoding samples that possess hierarchical structures. In contrast, hyperbolic space exhibits exponential volume growth relative to radius, making it inherently strong at capturing the hierarchical structure of samples from both seen and unseen categories. Therefore, we propose to tackle the category discovery challenge in the hyperbolic space. We introduce HypCD, a simple Hyperbolic framework for learning hierarchy-aware representations and classifiers for generalized Category Discovery. HypCD first transforms the Euclidean embedding space of the backbone network into hyperbolic space, facilitating subsequent representation and classification learning by considering both hyperbolic distance and the angle between samples. This approach is particularly helpful for knowledge transfer from known to unknown categories in GCD. We thoroughly evaluate HypCD on public GCD benchmarks, by applying it to various baseline and state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving significant improvements",

Modeling these behaviors is essential for understanding human interaction and for creating virtual characters that can communicate naturally in applications like games, films, and virtual reality. However, existing motion generation models are typically limited to specific input modalities--either speech, text, or motion data--and cannot fully leverage the diversity of available data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that unifies verbal and non-verbal language using multimodal language models for human motion understanding and generation. This model is flexible in taking text, speech, and motion or any combination of them as input. Coupled with our novel pre-training strategy, our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on co-speech gesture generation but also requires much less data for training. Our model also unlocks an array of novel tasks such as editable gesture generation and emotion prediction from motion. We believe unifying the verbal and non-verbal language of human motion is essential for real-world applications, and language models offer a powerful approach to achieving this goal",

To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM designed for multi-image part-level reasoning segmentation.

Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models",

However, existing VideoQG methods usually suffer from spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to a failure to identify the dominant visual scenes that align with the intended question. Moreover, vision-language models exhibit unfaithful generalization performance and lack robustness on challenging downstream tasks such as VideoQG. In this work, we propose a novel VideoQG framework named Cross-modal Causal Relation Alignment (CRA), to eliminate spurious correlations and improve the causal consistency between question-answering and video temporal grounding. Our CRA involves three essential components: i) Gaussian Smoothing Grounding (GSG) module for estimating the time interval via cross-modal attention, which is de-noised by an adaptive Gaussian filter, ii) Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA) enhances the performance of weakly supervised VideoQG by leveraging bidirectional contrastive learning between estimated video segments and QA features, iii) Explicit Causal Intervention (ECI) module for multimodal deconfounding, which involves front-door intervention for vision and back-door intervention for language. Extensive experiments on two VideoQG datasets demonstrate the superiority of our CRA in discovering visually grounded content and achieving robust question reasoning.

We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings.By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \"blind faith in text\" phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns.We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training.Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies",

Classic physically-based rendering (PBR) accurately simulates the light transport, but relies on precise scene representations--explicit 3D geometry, high-quality material properties, and lighting conditions--that are often impractical to obtain in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we introduce Diffusion Renderer, a neural approach that addresses the dual problem of inverse and forward rendering within a holistic framework. Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse rendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos, providing an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the rendering model. Conversely, our rendering model generates photorealistic images from G-buffers without explicit light transport simulation. Specifically, we first train a video diffusion model for inverse rendering on synthetic data, which generalizes well to real-world videos and allows us to auto-label diverse real-world videos. We then co-train our rendering model using both synthetic and auto-labeled real-world data. Experiments demonstrate that Diffusion Renderer effectively approximates inverse and forwards rendering, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art.

However, due to the data sparsity and limited views, the clustering-based label fitting in unsupervised object detection often generates low-quality pseudo-labels. Multi-agent collaborative dataset, which involves the sharing of complementary observations among agents, holds the potential to break through this bottleneck. In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method that learns to Detect Objects from Multi-Agent LiDAR scans, termed DOtA, without using labels from external. DOtA first uses the internally shared ego-pose and ego-shape of collaborative agents to initialize the detector, leveraging the generalization performance of neural networks to infer preliminary labels. Subsequently, DOtA uses the complementary observations between agents to perform multi-scale encoding on preliminary labels, then decodes high-quality and low-quality labels. These labels are further used as prompts to guide a correct feature learning process, thereby enhancing the performance of the unsupervised object detection task. Extensive experiments on the V2V4Real and OPV2V datasets show that our DOtA outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised 3D object detection methods.

This phenomenon prompts us to diverge from the trend in 3D vision and instead pursue an alternative and successful solution: deeper neural networks.

However, the integration of multi-layer visual features in MLLMs remains underexplored, particularly with regard to optimal layer selection and fusion strategies. Existing methods often rely on arbitrary design choices, leading to suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we systematically investigate two core aspects of multi-layer visual feature fusion: (1) selecting the most effective visual layers and (2) identifying the best fusion approach with the language model. Our experiments reveal that while combining visual features from multiple stages improves generalization, incorporating additional features from the same stage typically leads to diminished performance. Furthermore, we find that direct fusion of multi-layer visual features at the input stage consistently yields superior and more stable performance across various configurations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become one of the most commonly used backbones for vision tasks. Despite their remarkable performance, they often suffer significant accuracy drop when quantized for practical deployment, particularly by post-training quantization (PTQ) under ultra-low bits. Recently, reconstruction-based PTQ methods have shown promising performance in quantizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, they fail when applied to ViTs, primarily due to the inaccurate estimation of output importance and the substantial accuracy degradation in quantizing post-GELU activations. To address these issues, we propose APHQ-ViT, a novel PTQ approach based on importance estimation with Average Perturbation Hessian (APH). Specifically, we first thoroughly analyze the current approximation approaches with Hessian loss, and propose an improved average perturbation Hessian loss. To deal with the quantization of the post-GELU activations, we design an MLP-Reconstruction (MR) method by replacing the GELU function in MLP with ReLU and reconstructing it by the APH loss on a small unlabeled calibration set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APHQ-ViT using linear quantizers outperforms existing PTQ methods by substantial margins in 3-bit and 4-bit across different vision tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Most Multi-view Clustering approaches assume that all views are available for clustering. However, this assumption is often unrealistic as views are incrementally accumulated over time, leading to a need for continual multi-view clustering (CMVC) methods. Current approaches to CMVC leverage late fusion-based approaches, where a new model is typically learned individually for each view to obtain the corresponding partition matrix, and then used to update a consensus matrix via a moving average. These approaches are prone to view-specific noise and struggle to adapt to large gaps between different views. To address these shortcomings, we reconsider CMVC from the perspective of domain adaptation and propose AdaptCMVC, which learns how to incrementally accumulate knowledge of new views as they become available and prevents catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, a self-training framework is introduced to extend the model to new views, particularly designed to be robust to view-specific noise. Further, to combat catastrophic forgetting, a structure alignment mechanism is proposed to enable the model to explore the global group structure across multiple views. Experiments on several multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on the CMVC task. The code is available at: AdaptCMVC",

    "abstract": "Prior works employing pixel-based Gaussian representation have demonstrated efficacy in feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction. However, such representation necessitates cross-view overlap for accurate depth estimation, and is challenged by object occlusions and frustum truncations. As a result, these methods require scene-centric data acquisition to maintain cross-view overlap and complete scene visibility to circumvent occlusions and truncations, which limits their applicability to scene-centric reconstruction. In contrast, in autonomous driving scenarios, a more practical paradigm is ego-centric reconstruction, which is characterized by minimal cross-view overlap and frequent occlusions and truncations. The limitations of pixel-based representation thus hinder the utility of prior works in this task. In light of this, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of different representations, and introduces Omni-Gaussian representation with tailored network design to complement their strengths and mitigate their drawbacks. Experiments show that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, pixelSplat and MVSplat, in ego-centric reconstruction, and achieves comparable performance to prior works in scene-centric reconstruction.

However, existing methods often require either a complete, well-reconstructed 3D model or numerous reference images that fully cover the object. Estimating 6D poses from partial references, which capture only fragments of an object's appearance and geometry, remains challenging. To address this, we propose UA-Pose, an uncertainty-aware approach for 6D object pose estimation and online object completion specifically designed for partial references. We assume access to either (1) a limited set of RGBD images with known poses or (2) a single 2D image. For the first case, we initialize a partial object 3D model based on the provided images and poses, while for the second, we use image-to-3D techniques to generate an initial object 3D model. Our method integrates uncertainty into the incomplete 3D model, distinguishing between seen and unseen regions. This uncertainty enables confidence assessment in pose estimation and guides an uncertainty-aware sampling strategy for online object completion, enhancing robustness in pose estimation accuracy and improving object completeness. We evaluate our method on the YCB-Video, YCBInEOAT, and HO3D datasets, including RGBD sequences of YCB objects manipulated by robots and human hands.

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) involves diverse tasks with a broad range of visual content manipulation intent across domain, scene, object, and attribute. The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image, especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network, named PrediCIR, to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically, a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view, coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then, a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

Five visual recognition tasks, ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting), are considered.

A desirable property is that a correspondence estimate (e.g., the true oracle correspondence) for an image pair is maintained under deformations of the input images.

In this work, we present careful analyses of equivariance properties in the context of multi-step deep registration networks. Based on these analyses we 1) introduce the notions of [U,U] equivariance (network equivariance to the same deformations of the input images) and [W,U] equivariance (where input images can undergo different deformations); we 2) show that in a suitable multi-step registration setup it is sufficient for overall [W,U] equivariance if the first step has [W,U] equivariance and all others have [U,U] equivariance; we 3) show that common displacement-predicting networks only exhibit [U,U] equivariance to translations instead of the more powerful [W,U] equivariance; and we 4) show how to achieve multi-step [W,U] equivariance via a coordinate-attention mechanism combined with displacement-predicting networks.

    "abstract": "Human Motion Recovery (HMR) research mainly focuses on ground-based motions such as running. The study on capturing climbing motion, an off-ground motion, is sparse. This is partly due to the limited availability of climbing motion datasets, especially large-scale and challenging 3D labeled datasets. To address the insufficiency of climbing motion datasets, we collect AscendMotion, a large-scale well-annotated, and challenging climbing motion dataset. It consists of 412k RGB, LiDAR frames, and IMU measurements, which includes the challenging climbing motions of 22 professional climbing coaches across 12 different rocks. Capturing the climbing motions is challenging as it requires precise recovery of not only the complex pose but also the global position of climbers. Although multiple global HMR methods have been proposed, they cannot faithfully capture climbing motions. To address the limitations of HMR methods for climbing, we propose ClimbingCap, a motion recovery method that reconstructs continuous 3D human climbing motion in a global coordinate system. One key insight is to use the RGB and the LiDAR modalities to separately reconstruct motions in camera coordinates and global coordinates and optimize them jointly. We demonstrate the quality of the AscendMotion dataset and present promising results from ClimbingCap. The AscendMotion dataset and the source code of ClimbingCap will be released publicly to the research community",

    "abstract": "Text-driven avatar generation has gained significant attention owing to its convenience. However, existing methods typically model the human body with all garments as a single 3D model, limiting its usability, such as clothing replacement, and reducing user control over the generation process. To overcome the limitations above, we propose DAGSM, a novel pipeline that generates disentangled human bodies and garments from the given text prompts. Specifically, we model each part (e.g., body, upper/lower clothes) of the clothed human as one GS-enhanced mesh (GSM), which is a traditional mesh attached with 2D Gaussians to better handle complicated textures (e.g., woolen, translucent clothes) and produce realistic cloth animations. During the generation, we first create the unclothed body, followed by a sequence of individual cloth generation based on the body, where we introduce a semantic-based algorithm to achieve better human-cloth and garment-garment separation. To improve texture quality, we propose a view-consistent texture refinement module, including a cross-view attention mechanism for texture style consistency and an incident-angle-weighted denoising (IAW-DE) strategy to update the appearance. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that DAGSM generates high-quality disentangled avatars, supports clothing replacement and realistic animation, and outperforms the baselines in visual quality",

    "abstract": "Successful forensic detectors can produce excellent results in supervised learning benchmarks but struggle to transfer to real-world applications. We believe this limitation is largely due to inadequate training data quality. While most research focuses on developing new algorithms, less attention is given to training data selection, despite evidence that performance can be strongly impacted by spurious correlations such as content, format, or resolution. A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific artifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end, we propose B-Free, a bias-free training paradigm, where fake images are generated from real ones using the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures semantic alignment between real and fake images, allowing any differences to stem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through content-based augmentation, we show significant improvements in both generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more calibrated results across 27 different generative models, including recent releases, like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning.

In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This work presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes.

This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce **PathEval**, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet, their effectiveness in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional changes, especially when test data distributions diverge from training data. Therefore, the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged, enabling the use of online off-the-shelf data at test time, supporting independent sample predictions, and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA methods, however, often rely on costly training or optimization processes, or make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and test data.Instead, this study proposes FreeTTA, a training-free and universally available method that makes no assumptions, to enhance the flexibility of TTA. More importantly, FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model the test data distribution, enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings",

DyT is inspired by the observation that layer normalization in Transformers often produces tanh-like, S-shaped input-output mappings. By incorporating DyT, Transformers without normalization can match or exceed the performance of their normalized counterparts, mostly without hyperparameter tuning. We validate the effectiveness of Transformers with DyT across diverse settings, ranging from recognition to generation, supervised to self-supervised learning, and computer vision to language models.

    "abstract": "Recent open-vocabulary human-object interaction (OV-HOI) detection methods primarily rely on large language model (LLM) for generating auxiliary descriptions and leverage knowledge distilled from CLIP to detect unseen interaction categories. Despite their effectiveness, these methods face two challenges: (1) feature granularity deficiency, due to reliance on last layer visual features for text alignment, leading to the neglect of crucial object-level details from intermediate layers; (2) semantic similarity confusion, resulting from CLIP's inherent biases toward certain classes, while LLM-generated descriptions based solely on labels fail to adequately capture inter-class similarities. To address these challenges, we propose a stratified granular comparison network. First, we introduce a granularity sensing alignment module that aggregates global semantic features with local details, refining interaction representations and ensuring robust alignment between intermediate visual features and text embeddings. Second, we develop a hierarchical group comparison module that recursively compares and groups classes using LLMs, generating fine-grained and discriminative descriptions for each interaction category.

To address these, we propose a novel two-stage generative densification method, named Hierarchical Pose AutoRegressive Transformer (HiPART), to generate hierarchical 2D dense poses from the original sparse 2D pose. Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale skeleton tokenization module to quantize the highly dense 2D pose into hierarchical tokens and propose a skeleton-aware alignment to strengthen token connections. We then develop a hierarchical autoregressive modeling scheme for hierarchical 2D pose generation. With generated hierarchical poses as inputs for 2D-to-3D lifting, the proposed method shows strong robustness in occluded scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the single-frame-based 3D HPE.

In each stage, we align visual factors -- lip movements, face identity, and facial expressions -- with corresponding acoustic counterparts to ensure the seamless transformation. Additionally, to generate realistic and coherent speech from the visual representations, we employ a flow matching model that estimates direct trajectories from a simple prior distribution to the target speech distribution.

To address these issues, we propose a Differentiable Feature Matching (DFM) framework for joint optimization of the feature extractor and the matching head. DFM transforms nearest-neighbor matching into a pooling-based module and embeds it within a Feature Matching Network (FMN). This design enables end-to-end feature extraction and feature matching module training, thus providing better feature representation for anomaly detection tasks. DFM is generic and can be incorporated into existing feature-matching methods. We implement DFM with various backbones and conduct extensive experiments across various tasks and datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated significant potential over traditional rendering techniques, attracting widespread attention from both industry and academia. However, real-time rendering with 3DGS remains a challenging problem, particularly in large-scale, high-resolution scenes due to the presence of numerous anisotropic Gaussian representations, and it has not been extensively explored. To address this challenge, we introduce FlashGS, an open-source CUDA library with Python bindings, featuring comprehensive algorithm design and optimizations, including redundancy elimination, adaptive scheduling, and efficient pipelining. First, we eliminate substantial redundant computations through precise Gaussian intersection tests, leveraging the intrinsic mechanism of the 3DGS rasterizer. During task partitioning, we propose an adaptive scheduling strategy that accounts for variations in Gaussian size and shape. Additionally, we design a multi-stage pipelining strategy for color computation in the rendering process, further accelerating performance. We conduct an extensive evaluation of FlashGS across a diverse range of synthetic and real-world 3D scenes, encompassing scene sizes of up to 2.7 km^2 cityscape and resolutions of up to over 4K. Our approach improves 3DGS rendering performance by an order of magnitude, achieving an average speedup of 7.2x, and rendering at a minimum of 125.9 FPS, setting a new state-of-the-art in real-time 3DGS rendering. https://github.com/InternLandMark/FlashGS",

    "abstract": "Point-Supervised Object Detection (PSOD) in a discriminative style has recently gained significant attention for its impressive detection performance and cost-effectiveness. However, accurately predicting high-quality pseudo-box labels for drone-view images, which often feature densely packed small objects, remains a challenge. This difficulty arises primarily from the limitation of rigid sampling strategies, which hinder the pseudo-box optimization process. To address this, we propose PointSR, an effective and robust point-supervised object detection framework with self-regularized sampling that integrates temporal and informative constraints throughout the pseudo-box generation process. Specifically, the framework comprises three key components: Temporal-Ensembling Encoder (TE Encoder), Coarse Pseudo-box Prediction, and Pseudo-box Refinement. The TE Encoder builds an anchor prototype library by aggregating temporal information for dynamic anchor adjustment. In Coarse Pseudo-box Prediction, anchors are refined using the prototype library, and a set of informative samples is collected for subsequent refinement. During Pseudo-box Refinement, these informative negative samples are used to suppress low-confidence candidate positive samples, thereby improving the quality of the pseudo-boxes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PointSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 2.6%~\\mathbf 7.2% higher AP_ 50 using only point supervision.

To model the timeline control capability, We first annotate the time intervals of facial actions in natural facial motion sequences at a frame-level granularity. This process is facilitated by Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-based Clustering to minimize human labor. Based on the annotations, we propose a diffusion-based generation model capable of generating facial motions that are natural and accurately aligned with input timelines.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenging problem of open-world instance segmentation. Existing works have shown that vanilla visual networks are biased toward learning appearance information, e.g. texture, to recognize objects. This implicit bias causes the model to fail in detecting novel objects with unseen textures in the open-world setting. To address this challenge, we propose a learning framework, called view-Consistent LeaRning (v-CLR), which aims to enforce the model to learn appearance-invariant representations for robust instance segmentation. In v-CLR, we first introduce additional views for each image, where the texture undergoes significant alterations while preserving the image's underlying structure. We then encourage the model to learn the appearance-invariant representation by enforcing the consistency between object features across different views, for which we obtain class-agnostic object proposals using off-the-shelf unsupervised models that possess strong object-awareness. These proposals enable cross-view object feature matching, greatly reducing the appearance dependency while enhancing the object-awareness.

Despite their advantages, creating high-quality SVG content remains challenging, as it demands technical expertise with professional editing software and a considerable time investment to craft complex shapes. Recent text-to-SVG generation methods aim to make vector graphics creation more accessible, but they still encounter limitations in shape regularity, generalization ability, and expressiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce Chat2SVG, a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) and image diffusion models for text-to-SVG generation. Our approach first uses an LLM to generate semantically meaningful SVG templates from basic geometric primitives. Guided by image diffusion models, a dual-stage optimization pipeline refines paths in latent space and adjusts point coordinates to enhance geometric complexity. Extensive experiments show that Chat2SVG outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity, path regularity, and semantic alignment.

Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction from such recordings is challenging due to limited observations, which leaves unobserved regions under-constrained and can lead to artifacts in novel views. To address this problem, we introduce a multi-view head diffusion model, leveraging its priors to fill in missing regions and ensure view consistency in Gaussian splatting renderings. To enable precise viewpoint control, we use normal maps rendered from FLAME-based head reconstruction, which provides pixel-aligned inductive biases. We also condition the diffusion model on VAE features extracted from the input image to preserve facial identity and appearance details. For Gaussian avatar reconstruction, we distill multi-view diffusion priors by using iteratively denoised images as pseudo-ground truths, effectively mitigating over-saturation issues. To further improve photorealism, we apply latent upsampling priors to refine the denoised latent before decoding it into an image. We evaluate our method on the NeRSemble dataset, showing that GAF outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis.

To address this issue, we decouple visual encoding into separate pathways, while still leveraging a single, unified transformer architecture for processing. The decoupling not only alleviates the conflict between the visual encoder's roles in understanding and generation, but also enhances the framework's flexibility. For instance, both the multimodal understanding and generation components can independently select their most suitable encoding methods.

However, mmWave-based human walking pose estimation (HWPE) is still in the nascent development stages, primarily due to its unique set of practical challenges including the quality of the observed radar signal dependent on the subject's motion direction. This paper introduces the first comprehensive study comparing mmWave radar to camera systems for HWPE, highlighting its utility for distance-agnostic and occlusion-resilient pose estimation. Building upon mmWave's unique advantages, we address its intrinsic directionality issue through a new approach--the synergetic integration of multi-modal, multi-view mmWave signals, achieving robust HWPE against variations both in distance and walking direction.

In this work, we present MagicArticulate, an effective framework that automatically transforms static 3D models into articulation-ready assets. Our key contributions are threefold.

Second, we propose a novel skeleton generation method that formulates the task as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging an auto-regressive transformer to naturally handle varying numbers of bones or joints within skeletons and their inherent dependencies across different 3D models. Third, we predict skinning weights using a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and joints.

However, they typically demand careful design in terms of data or models and lack awareness of the impact of distributional shifts. In this paper, we observe that classification errors arising from distribution shifts tend to cluster near the true values, suggesting that misclassifications commonly occur in semantically similar, neighboring categories. Furthermore, robust advanced vision foundation models maintain larger inter-class distances while preserving semantic consistency, making them less vulnerable to such shifts. Building on these findings, we propose a new method called GFN (Gain From Neighbors), which uses gradient priors from neighboring classes to perturb input images and incorporates an inter-class distance-weighted loss to improve class separation. This approach encourages the model to learn more resilient features from data prone to errors, enhancing its robustness against shifts in diverse settings. In extensive experiments across various model architectures and benchmark datasets, GFN consistently demonstrated superior performance.

First, existing methods focus on analyzing dense features (e.g., large pixel regions), which are sensitive to local noise (e.g., light spots, blurs) and result in increased computational complexity. Second, an eyeball model can correspond multiple gaze directions, and the entangled representation between gazes and models increases the learning difficulty. To address these issues, we propose De\\textsuperscript 2Gaze , a lightweight and accurate model-aware 3D gaze estimation method. In De\\textsuperscript 2 Gaze, we introduce two key innovations for deformable and decoupled representation learning. Specifically, first, we propose a deformable sparse attention mechanism that can adapt sparse sampling points to attention areas to avoid local noise influences. Second, we propose a spatial decoupling network with a dual-branch decoding architecture to disentangle invariant (e.g., eyeball radius, position) and variable (e.g., gaze, pupil, iris) features from the latent space. Compared to existing methods, De\\textsuperscript 2 Gaze requires fewer sparse features, and achieves faster convergence speed, lower computational complexity, and higher accuracy in 3D gaze estimation.Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that De\\textsuperscript 2 Gaze achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high-quality semantic segmentation for 3D gaze estimation on the TEyeD dataset",

    "abstract": "Intelligent robots need to interact with diverse objects across various environments. The appearance and state of objects frequently undergo complex transformations depending on the object properties, e.g., phase transitions. However, in the vision community, segmenting dynamic objects with phase transitions is overlooked. In light of this, we introduce the concept of phase in segmentation, which categorizes real-world objects based on their visual characteristics and potential morphological and appearance changes. Then, we present a new benchmark, Multi-Phase, Multi-Transition, and Multi-Scenery Video Object Segmentation (M^3-VOS), to verify the ability of models to understand object phases, which consists of 471 high-resolution videos spanning over 10 distinct everyday scenarios. It provides dense instance mask annotations that capture both object phases and their transitions. We evaluate state-of-the-art methods on M^3-VOS, yielding several key insights. Notably, current appearance-based approaches show significant room for improvement when handling objects with phase transitions. The inherent changes in disorder suggest that the predictive performance of the forward entropy-increasing process can be improved through a reverse entropy-reducing process. These findings lead us to propose ReVOS, a new plug-and-play model that improves its performance by reversal refinement.

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) aims to continually accumulate knowledge from a non-stationary data stream without catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge, requiring a balance between stability and adaptability. Relying on the generalizable representation in pre-trained models (PTMs), PTM-based CL methods perform effective continual adaptation on downstream tasks by adding learnable adapters or prompts upon the frozen PTMs. However, many existing PTM-based CL methods use restricted adaptation on a fixed set of these modules to avoid forgetting, suffering from limited CL ability. Periodically adding task-specific modules results in linear model growth rate and impaired knowledge reuse. We propose Self-Expansion of pre-trained models with Modularized Adaptation (SEMA), a novel approach to enhance the control of stability-plasticity balance in PTM-based CL. SEMA automatically decides to reuse or add adapter modules on demand in CL, depending on whether significant distribution shift that cannot be handled is detected at different representation levels. We design modular adapter consisting of a functional adapter and a representation descriptor. The representation descriptors are trained as a distribution shift indicator and used to trigger self-expansion signals. For better composing the adapters, an expandable weighting router is learned jointly for mixture of adapter outputs. SEMA enables better knowledge reuse and sub-linear expansion rate. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-expansion method, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to PTM-based CL methods without memory rehearsal.

Specifically, DPIR consits of two branches: a low-quality image conditioning branch and a dual prompting control branch. The first branch utilizes a lightweight module to incorporate image priors into the DiT with high efficiency. More importantly, we believe that in image restoration, textual description alone cannot fully capture its rich visual characteristics. Therefore, a dual prompting module is designed to provide DiT with additional visual cues, capturing both global context and local appearance.

To develop a directly-trained , low energy consumption and high-performance multi-scale SNN model, we propose a novel interpretable object detection framework Multi-scale Spiking Detector (MSD).

Wherein, spiking multi-scale fusion and the spiking detector are employed to integrate features across different depths and to detect response outcomes, respectively. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art ANN detectors, with only 7.8 M parameters and 6.43 mJ energy consumption.

Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification on ImageNet does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks on COCO or ADE20K are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task.

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to improve the performance of source-domain pre-trained models on previously unseen, shifted target domains. Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams, making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data. The recently proposed diffusion-driven TTA methods mitigate this by adapting model inputs instead of weights, where an unconditional diffusion model, trained on the source domain, transforms target-domain data into a synthetic domain that is expected to approximate the source domain. However, in this paper, we reveal that although the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA seems indistinguishable from the source data, it is unaligned with, or even markedly different from the latter for deep networks. To address this issue, we propose a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework. Our key insight is to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data to ensure better alignment. Specifically, we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples, creating a synthetic dataset. Subsequently, we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning. This Mix of Diffusion (MoD) process mitigates the potential domain misalignment between the conditional and unconditional models. Extensive experiments across classifiers, segmenters, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs, e.g., LLaVA) demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.

In this paper, we propose Motion Decomposition Transformer (MDT), a transformer-based architecture augmented with polarized modules for deblurring via motion vector decomposition. MDT consists of a Motion Decomposition Module (MDM) for extracting hybrid rotation and translation features, and a Radial Stripe Attention Solver (RSAS) for sharp image reconstruction with enhanced rotational information. Specifically, the MDM uses a deformable Cartesian convolutional branch to capture translational motion, complemented by a polar-system branch to capture rotational motion. The RSAS employs radial stripe windows and angular relative positional encoding in the polar system to enhance rotational information. This design preserves translational details while keeping computational costs lower than dual-coordinate design.

Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that infers relative depth by examining the spatial relationships and temporal evolution of a set of tracked 2D trajectories. Specifically, we use off-the-shelf point tracking models to capture 2D trajectories. Then, our approach employs spatial and temporal transformers to process these trajectories and directly infer depth changes over time. Evaluated on the TAPVid-3D benchmark, our method demonstrates robust zero-shot performance, generalizing effectively from synthetic to real-world datasets.

However, mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates, making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization, and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact, high-level semantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions, TexTok simplifies semantic learning, allowing more learning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained visual details, leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning, TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively, across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok, our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task, effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization",

In this work, we propose a multi-level image feature refinement method for emotion recognition (CocoER) to mitigate the impact caused by conflicting results from multi-level recognition. First, we leverage cross-level attention to improve visual feature consistency between hierarchically cropped head, body and context windows. Then, vocabulary informed alignment is incorporated into the recognition framework to produce pseudo label and guide hierarchical visual feature refinement. To effectively fuse multi-level feature, we elaborate on a competition process of eliminating irrelevant image level predictions and a coordination process to enhance the feature across all levels.

By enforcing orthogonality among prototypes and maximizing representational margins, HIPO constructs a resilient embedding space that mitigates forgetting and enables the seamless integration of new classes, thereby effectively countering overfitting.

However, the sensitivity of T2V generative models to input prompts highlights the critical role of prompt design in influencing generative outcomes. Prior research has predominantly relied on Large Language Models (LLMs) to align user-provided prompts with the distribution of training prompts, albeit without tailored guidance encompassing prompt vocabulary and sentence structure nuances. To this end, we introduce RAPO, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization framework. In order to address potential inaccuracies and ambiguous details generated by LLM-generated prompts. RAPO refines the naive prompts through dual optimization branches, selecting the superior prompt for T2V generation. The first branch augments user prompts with diverse modifiers extracted from a learned relational graph, refining them to align with the format of training prompts via a fine-tuned LLM. Conversely, the second branch rewrites the naive prompt using a pre-trained LLM following a well-defined instruction set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAPO can effectively enhance both the static and dynamic dimensions of generated videos, demonstrating the significance of prompt optimization for user-provided prompts.

Despite substantial progress, existing methods lack broad generalization capabilities and require category-specific training data. To address these limitations, we propose a fundamentally new approach to shape correspondence based on denoising diffusion models. In our method, a diffusion model learns to directly predict the functional map, a low-dimensional representation of a point-wise map between shapes. We use a large dataset of synthetic human meshes for training and employ two steps to reduce the number of functional maps that need to be learned. First, the maps refer to a template rather than shape pairs. Second, the functional map is defined in a basis of eigenvectors of the Laplacian, which is not unique due to sign ambiguity. Therefore, we introduce an unsupervised approach to select a specific basis by correcting the signs of eigenvectors based on surface features.

    "abstract": "While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts.In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention that hinder diffusion models from reflecting the image prompt. By addressing these issues, we propose a novel method that generates images that properly reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches often neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance, which directs the model towards the intended conditions and away from those undesirable. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt.In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt, achieved by selectively using keys and values from both images. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an alternative self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention, which jointly uses keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them.Through extensive experiments across three distinct image generation tasks, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing precise camera poses and floor plan layouts from wide-baseline RGB panoramas is a difficult and unsolved problem. We introduce BADGR, a novel diffusion model that jointly performs reconstruction and bundle adjustment (BA) to refine poses and layouts from a coarse state, using 1D floor boundary predictions from dozens of sparsely captured images. Unlike guided diffusion models, BADGR is conditioned on dense per-column outputs from a single-step Levenberg Marquardt (LM) optimizer and is trained to predict camera and wall positions, while minimizing reprojection errors for view consistency. The objective of layout generation from denoising diffusion process complements BA optimization by providing additional learned layout-structural constraints on top of the co-visible features across images. These constraints help BADGR make plausible guesses about spatial relationships, which constrain the pose graph, such as wall adjacency and collinearity, while also learning to mitigate errors from dense boundary observations using global context. BADGR trains exclusively on 2D floor plans, simplifying data acquisition, enabling robust augmentation, and supporting a variety of input densities. Our experiments validate our method, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pose and floor plan layout reconstruction with different input densities",

However, properties such as perspective and occlusion lead to the underestimation of the geometry in distant regions, posing a critical issue for safety-focused autonomous driving systems. To tackle this, we propose ScanSSC, a novel camera-based SSC model composed of a Scan Module and Scan Loss, both designed to enhance distant scenes by leveraging context from near-viewpoint scenes. The Scan Module uses axis-wise masked attention, where each axis employing a near-to-far cascade masking that enables distant voxels to capture relationships with preceding voxels. In addition, the Scan Loss computes the cross-entropy along each axis between cumulative logits and corresponding class distributions in a near-to-far direction, thereby propagating rich context-aware signals to distant voxels. Leveraging the synergy between these components, ScanSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, with IoUs of 44.54 and 48.29, and mIoUs of 17.40 and 20.14 on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, vision transformers (ViTs) have consistently demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks. However, attempts to enhance their robustness have yielded limited success, mainly focusing on different training strategies, input patch augmentation, or network structural enhancements. These approaches often involve extensive training and fine-tuning, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To tackle these obstacles, we introduce a novel approach named Spatial Autocorrelation Token Analysis (SATA). By harnessing spatial relationships between token features, SATA enhances both the representational capacity and robustness of ViT models. This is achieved through the analysis and grouping of tokens according to their spatial autocorrelation scores prior to their input into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) block of the self-attention mechanism. Importantly, SATA seamlessly integrates into existing pre-trained ViT baselines without requiring retraining or additional fine-tuning, while concurrently improving efficiency by reducing the computational load of the FFN units. Experimental results show that the baseline ViTs enhanced with SATA not only achieve a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K image classification (94.9%) but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across multiple robustness benchmarks, including ImageNet-A (top-1=63.6%), ImageNet-R (top-1=79.2%), and ImageNet-C (mCE=13.6%), all without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of baseline models.

In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to their significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current semi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or consider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames, often overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous driving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such as roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects exhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is also captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby objects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these characteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and low-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These representations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the representations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively utilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiLoTs outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, and achieves performance close to LiDAR+Camera multimodal approaches",

To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul.

    "abstract": "Standard video codecs are rate-distortion optimization machines, where distortion is typically quantified using PSNR versus the source. However, it is now widely accepted that increasing PSNR does not necessarily translate to better visual quality. In this paper, a better balance between perception and fidelity is targeted, in order to provide for significant rate savings over state-of-the-art standards-based video codecs. Specifically, pre- and postprocessing neural networks are proposed that enhance the coding efficiency of standard video codecs when benchmarked with an array of well-established perceptual quality scores. These \"neural wrapper\" elements are end-to-end trained with a neural codec module serving as a differentiable proxy for standard video codecs. The codec proxy is jointly optimized with the pre- and post components, via a novel two-phase pretraining strategy and end-to-end iterative refinement with stop-gradient. This allows the neural pre- and postprocessor to learn to embed, remove and recover information in a codec-aware manner, thus improving its rate-quality performance. A single neural-wrapper model is thereby established and used for the entire rate-quality curve without needing any downscaling or upscaling. The trained model is tested with the AV1 and VVC standard codecs via an array of well-established objective quality scores (SSIM, MS-SSIM, VMAF, AVQT), as well as mean opinion scores (MOS) derived from ITU-T P.910 subjective testing. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves all quality scores, with -18.5% average Bjontegaard Delta-rate (BD-rate) saving over all objective scores and MOS improvement over both standard codecs.

Although these methods have shown outstanding results, they often introduce significant computation overhead due to the high density of virtual points and noise due to inaccurate depth completion. Besides, they do not thoroughly leverage semantic information from images. In this work, we propose the virtual key instance enhanced network (ViKIENet), a highly efficient and effective multi-modal feature fusion framework that fuses the features of virtual key instances (VKIs) and LiDAR points through multiple stages.

A key factor contributing to their effectiveness is the high quantity and quality of data used during training. However, mainstream DMs now consume increasingly large amounts of data. For example, training a Stable Diffusion model requires billions of image-text pairs. This enormous data requirement poses significant challenges for training large DMs due to high data acquisition costs and storage expenses. To alleviate this data burden, we propose a novel scenario: using existing DMs as data sources to train new DMs with any architecture. We refer to this scenario as Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM), where the generative ability of DMs is transferred to new ones in a data-free manner. To tackle this challenge, we make two main contributions. First, we introduce a DKDM objective that enables the training of new DMs via distillation, without requiring access to the data. Second, we develop a dynamic iterative distillation method that efficiently extracts time-domain knowledge from existing DMs, enabling direct retrieval of training data without the need for a prolonged generative process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this scenario.

Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, existing LMMs face a critical issue: they often fail to effectively leverage the visual context in multimodal demonstrations and instead simply follow textual patterns. This indicates that LMMs do not achieve effective alignment between multimodal demonstrations and model outputs. To address this problem, we propose Symbol Demonstration Direct Preference Optimization (SymDPO). Specifically, SymDPO aims to break the traditional paradigm of constructing multimodal demonstrations by using random symbols to replace text answers within instances. This forces the model to carefully understand the demonstration images and establish a relationship between the images and the symbols to answer questions correctly. We validate the effectiveness of this method on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that with SymDPO, LMMs can more effectively understand the multimodal context within examples and utilize this knowledge to answer questions better.

Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness.

However, traditional data-free UAP methods often suffer from limited transferability due to the absence of semantic content in random noise. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-free universal attack method that recursively extracts pseudo-semantic priors directly from the UAPs during training to enrich the semantic content within the data-free UAP framework. Our approach effectively leverages latent semantic information within UAPs via region sampling, enabling successful input transformations--typically ineffective in traditional data-free UAP methods due to the lack of semantic cues--and significantly enhancing black-box transferability. Furthermore, we introduce a sample reweighting technique to mitigate potential imbalances from random sampling and transformations, emphasizing hard examples less affected by the UAPs. Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in average fooling rate by a substantial margin, notably improves attack transferability across various CNN architectures compared to existing data-free UAP methods, and even surpasses data-dependent UAP methods.

In this paper, we propose a debiased preference optimization dataset, RLAIF-V-Bias, and introduce a Noise-Aware Preference Optimization (NAPO) algorithm. Specifically, we first construct the dataset by introducing perturbations to reduce the informational content of certain modalities, prompting the model to overly rely on a specific modality when generating responses. To address the inevitable noise in automatically constructed data, we combine the noise-robust Mean Absolute Error (MAE) with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) in Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using a negative Box-Cox transformation and dynamically adjust the algorithm's noise robustness based on the evaluated noise levels in the data.Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating not only its effectiveness in mitigating modality bias but also its significant role in minimizing hallucinations",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in RGBD-based category-level object pose estimation have been limited by their reliance on precise depth information, restricting their broader applicability. In response, RGB-based methods have been developed. Among these methods, geometry-guided pose regression that originated from instance-level tasks has demonstrated strong performance. However, we argue that the NOCS map is an inadequate intermediate representation for geometry-guided pose regression method, as its many-to-one correspondence with category-level pose introduces redundant instance-specific information, resulting in suboptimal results. This paper identifies the intra-class variation problem inherent in pose regression based solely on the NOCS map and proposes the Intra-class Variation-Free Consensus (IVFC) map, a novel coordinate representation generated from the category-level consensus model. By leveraging the complementary strengths of the NOCS map and the IVFC map, we introduce GIVEPose, a framework that implements Gradual Intra-class Variation Elimination for category-level object pose estimation. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GIVEPose significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art RGB-based approaches, achieving substantial improvements in category-level object pose estimation.

    "abstract": "Egocentric motion capture with a head-mounted body-facing stereo camera is crucial for VR and AR applications but presents significant challenges such as heavy occlusions and limited annotated real-world data. Existing methods rely on synthetic pretraining and struggle to generate smooth and accurate predictions in real-world settings, particularly for lower limbs. Our work addresses these limitations by introducing a lightweight VR-based data collection setup with on-board, real-time 6D pose tracking. Using this setup, we collected the most extensive real-world dataset for ego-facing ego-mounted cameras to date in size and motion variability. Effectively integrating this multimodal input -- device pose and camera feeds -- is challenging due to the differing characteristics of each data source. To address this, we propose FRAME, a simple yet effective architecture that combines device pose and camera feeds for state-of-the-art body pose prediction through geometrically sound multimodal integration and can run at 300 FPS on modern hardware. Lastly, we showcase a novel training strategy to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Our approach exploits the problem's geometric properties, yielding high-quality motion capture free from common artifacts in prior works.

    "abstract": "As sketch research has collectively matured over time, its adaptation for at-mass commercialisation emerges on the immediate horizon. Despite an already mature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient inference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first demonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed for photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific components which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to adapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised sketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo efficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of FLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then exploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector that dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down number of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37% of FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while retaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient network for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best photo counterpart",

However, in image based disease classification, such as glioma sub-typing, distinguishing between classes using image semantic attributes can be challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel GZSL method that eliminates the dependency on semantic information. Specifically, we propose that the primary of most classification in clinic is risk stratification, and classes are inherently ordered rather than purely categorical. Based on this insight, we present an inter-class feature augmentation (IFA) module, where distributions of different classes are ordered by their risk levels in a learned feature space using pre-defined joint conditional Gaussian distribution model. This ordering enables the generation of unseen class features through feature mixing of adjacent seen classes, effectively transforming the zero-shot learning problem into a supervised learning task. Our method eliminates the need for explicit semantic information, avoiding the cross-modal alignment between visual and semantic features. Moreover, the IFA module for GZSL requires no structural modifications to the existing classification models. In the experiment, both in-house and public datasets are used to evaluate our method across different tasks, including glioma subtyping, Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification and diabetic retinopathy classification. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art GZSL methods with statistical significance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry (x, a, S) and texture (c) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS",

We propose AGPlace, a model that effectively integrates information from multi-modal ground sensors (cameras and LiDARs) to achieve accurate aerial-ground PR.

It outperforms existing state-of-the-art cross-view PR models on large-scale datasets. As most existing PR models are designed for ground-ground PR, we adapt these baselines into our cross-view pipeline.

Despite advances, Transformer and CNN based methods often struggle with variations in staining and morphology, limiting feature extraction. In medical image segmentation, where datasets often have limited sample availability, recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods achieve higher accuracy by leveraging pre-trained encoders, whereas end-to-end methods tend to underperform. This is due to challenges in effectively transferring rich multiscale features from encoders to decoders, as well as limitations in decoder efficiency. To address these issues, we propose an architecture that captures multi-scale local and global contextual information and a novel decoder design, which effectively integrates features from the encoder, emphasizes important channels and regions, and reconstructs spatial dimensions to enhance segmentation accuracy. Our method, compatible with various encoders, outperforms SOTA methods, as demonstrated by experiments on four datasets and ablation studies.

A straightforward approach is to use multimodal large language models to obtain more samples, but this may cause hallucinations, generate incorrect sample pairs, and cost significantly.To address the above issues, we design a simple yet effective synthesis framework that consists of two independent steps: table image rendering and table question and answer (Q&A) pairs generation.We use table codes (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown) to synthesize images and generate Q&A pairs with large language model (LLM).This approach leverages LLM's high concurrency and low cost to boost annotation efficiency and reduce expenses. By inputting code instead of images, LLMs can directly access the content and structure of the table, reducing hallucinations in table understanding and improving the accuracy of generated Q&A pairs. Finally, we synthesize a large-scale MTU dataset, SynTab, containing 636K images and 1.8M samples costing within \\200 in US dollars.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have made generative image editing more accessible than ever. While these developments allow users to generate creative edits with ease, they also raise significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding malicious edits to human portraits that threaten individuals' privacy and identity security. Existing general-purpose image protection methods primarily focus on generating adversarial perturbations to nullify edit effects. However, these approaches often exhibit instability to protect against diverse editing requests. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective to personal human portrait protection against malicious editing. Unlike traditional methods aiming to prevent edits from taking effect, our method, FaceLock, optimizes adversarial perturbations to ensure that original biometric information---such as facial features---is either destroyed or substantially altered post-editing, rendering the subject in the edited output biometrically unrecognizable. Our approach innovatively integrates facial recognition and visual perception factors into the perturbation optimization process, ensuring robust protection against a variety of editing attempts. Besides, we shed light on several critical issues with commonly used evaluation metrics in image editing and reveal cheating methods by which they can be easily manipulated, leading to deceptive assessments of protection. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FaceLock significantly outperforms all baselines in defense performance against a wide range of malicious edits. Moreover, our method also exhibits strong robustness against purification techniques. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the stability and broad applicability of our method across diverse diffusion-based editing algorithms.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in a variety of tasks, particularly in terms of prediction accuracy. However, in real-world scenarios, especially in safety-critical applications, accuracy alone is insufficient; reliable uncertainty estimates are essential. Modern DNNs, often trained with cross-entropy loss, tend to exhibit overconfidence, especially on ambiguous samples. Many techniques aim to improve uncertainty calibration, yet they often come at the cost of reduced accuracy or increased computational demands. To address this challenge, we propose Differentiated Deep Mutual Learning (Diff-DML), an efficient ensemble approach that simultaneously enhances accuracy and uncertainty calibration. Diff-DML draws inspiration from Deep Mutual Learning (DML) while introducing two strategies to maintain prediction diversity: (1) Differentiated Training Strategy (DTS) and (2) Diversity-Preserving Learning Objective (DPLO). Our theoretical analysis shows that Diff-DML's diversified learning framework not only leverages ensemble benefits but also avoids the loss of prediction diversity observed in traditional DML setups, which is crucial for improved calibration. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of Diff-DML. For instance, on the CIFAR-100 dataset, Diff-DML on ResNet34 model achieved substantial improvements over the previous state-of-the-art method, MDCA, with absolute accuracy gains of 1.3%/3.1%, relative ECE reductions of 49.6%/43.8%, and relative classwise-ECE reductions of 7.7%/13.0%",

    "abstract": "Most of the existing methods for video understanding primarily focus on videos only lasting tens of seconds, with limited exploration of techniques for handling long videos. The increased number of frames in long videos poses two main challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing long-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based system designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the long-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as to effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically, DrVideo first transforms a long video into a coarse text-based long document to initially retrieve key frames and then updates the documents with the augmented key frame information. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to continuously search for missing information and augment the document until sufficient question-related information is gathered for making the final predictions in a chain-of-thought manner. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo significantly outperforms existing LLM-based state-of-the-art methods on EgoSchema benchmark (3 minutes), MovieChat-1K benchmark (10 minutes), and the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average of 44 minutes).

    "title": "Infighting in the Dark: Multi-Label Backdoor Attack in Federated Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), a privacy-preserving decentralized machine learning framework, has been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Current research primarily focuses on the Single-Label Backdoor Attack (SBA), wherein adversaries share a consistent target. However, a critical fact is overlooked: adversaries may be non-cooperative, have distinct targets, and operate independently, which exhibits a more practical scenario called Multi-Label Backdoor Attack (MBA). Unfortunately, prior works are ineffective in the MBA scenario since non-cooperative attackers exclude each other. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation to uncover the inherent constraints of the exclusion: similar backdoor mappings are constructed for different targets, resulting in conflicts among backdoor functions. To address this limitation, we propose Mirage, the first non-cooperative MBA strategy in FL that allows attackers to inject effective and persistent backdoors into the global model without collusion by constructing in-distribution (ID) backdoor mapping. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial adaptation method to bridge the backdoor features and the target distribution in an ID manner. Additionally, we further leverage a constrained optimization method to ensure the ID mapping survives in the global training dynamics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mirage outperforms various state-of-the-art attacks and bypasses existing defenses, achieving an average ASR greater than 97% and maintaining over 90% after 900 rounds. This work aims to alert researchers to this potential threat and inspire the design of effective defense mechanisms. Code has been made open-source",

    "abstract": "Photorealistic 3D human modeling is essential for various applications and has seen tremendous progress. However, existing methods for monocular full-body reconstruction, typically relying on front and/or predicted back view, still struggle with satisfactory performance due to the ill-posed nature of the problem and sophisticated self-occlusions. In this paper, we propose PSHuman, a novel framework that explicitly reconstructs human meshes utilizing priors from the multiview diffusion model. It is found that directly applying multiview diffusion on single-view human images leads to severe geometric distortions, especially on generated faces. To address it, we propose a cross-scale diffusion that models the joint probability distribution of global full-body shape and local facial characteristics, enabling identity-preserved novel-view generation without geometric distortion. Moreover, to enhance cross-view body shape consistency of varied human poses, we condition the generative model on parametric models (SMPL-X), which provide body priors and prevent unnatural views inconsistent with human anatomy. Leveraging the generated multiview normal and color images, we present SMPLX-initialized explicit human carving to recover realistic textured human meshes efficiently. Extensive experiments on CAPE and THuman2.1 demonstrate PSHuman's superiority in geometry details, texture fidelity, and generalization capability",

Yet, their complex computations pose challenges for practical deployments, particularly in real-time applications. To tackle this issue, researchers have explored various lightweight and efficient network designs. However, existing lightweight models predominantly leverage self-attention mechanisms and convolutions for token mixing. This dependence brings limitations in effectiveness and efficiency in the perception and aggregation processes of lightweight networks, hindering the balance between performance and efficiency under limited computational budgets. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the dynamic heteroscale vision ability inherent in the efficient human vision system and propose a \"See Large, Focus Small\" strategy for lightweight vision network design. We introduce LS (Large-Small) convolution, which combines large-kernel perception and small-kernel aggregation. It can efficiently capture a wide range of perceptual information and achieve precise feature aggregation for dynamic and complex visual representations, thus enabling proficient processing of visual information. Based on LS convolution, we present LSNet, a new family of lightweight models.

It has the following technical innovations. (1) Disco4D learns to efficiently fit the clothing Gaussians over the SMPL-X Gaussians. (2) It adopts diffusion models to enhance the 3D generation process, e.g. modeling occluded parts not visible in the input image.

    "title": "DoraCycle: Domain-Oriented Adaptation of Unified Generative Model in Multimodal Cycles",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Adapting generative models to specific domains presents an effective solution for satisfying specialized requirements. However, adapting to some complex domains remains challenging, especially when these domains require substantial paired data to capture the targeted distributions. Since unpaired data from a single modality, such as vision or language, is more readily available, we utilize the bidirectional mappings between vision and language learned by the unified generative model to enable training on unpaired data for domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose DoraCycle, which integrates two multimodal cycles: text-to-image-to-text and image-to-text-to-image. The model is optimized through cross-entropy loss computed at the cycle endpoints, where both endpoints share the same modality. This facilitates self-evolution of the model without reliance on annotated text-image pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that for tasks independent of paired knowledge, such as stylization, DoraCycle can effectively adapt the unified model using only unpaired data. For tasks involving new paired knowledge, such as specific identities, a combination of a small set of paired image-text examples and larger-scale unpaired data is sufficient for effective domain-oriented adaptation.

    "abstract": "3D scene perception demands a large amount of adverse-weather LiDAR data, yet the cost of LiDAR data collection presents a significant scaling-up challenge. To this end, a series of LiDAR simulators have been proposed. Yet, they can only simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the fidelity is quite limited. This paper presents **WeatherGen**, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation framework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a map-based data producer, which is capable of providing a vast amount of high-quality diverse-weather data for training purposes. Then, we utilize the diffusion-denoising paradigm to construct a diffusion model. Among them, we propose a spider mamba generator with the spider mamba scan to restore the disturbed diverse weather data gradually. The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the LiDAR beam circle and central ray, excellently maintaining the physical structure of the LiDAR point cloud. Subsequently, we design a latent domain aligner following the generator to transfer real-world knowledge. Afterward, we devise a contrastive learning-based controller, which equips weather control signals with compact semantic knowledge through language supervision from CLIP, guiding the diffusion model in generating more discriminative data. Finally, we fine-tune WeatherGen with small-scale real-world data to further enhance its performance. Extensive evaluations on KITTI-360 and Seeing Through Fog demonstrate the high generation quality of WeatherGen. Through WeatherGen, we construct the mini-weather dataset, promoting the performance of the downstream task under adverse weather conditions",

Multispectral images (MSI), which capture additional spectral information, offer a promising solution to these challenges. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of relevant datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale Multispectral UAV Single Object Tracking dataset (MUST), which includes 250 video sequences spanning diverse environments and challenges, providing a comprehensive data foundation for multispectral UAV tracking. We also propose a novel tracking framework, UNTrack, which encodes unified spectral, spatial, and temporal features from spectrum prompts, initial templates, and sequential searches. UNTrack employs an asymmetric transformer with a spectral background eliminate mechanism for optimal relationship modeling and an encoder that continuously updates the spectrum prompt to refine tracking, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed UNTrack outperforms state-of-the-art UAV trackers. We believe our dataset and framework will drive future research in this area.

First, we introduce a large-scale HUman GEnerated training dataset, HuGe100K, consisting of 100K diverse, photorealistic human images with corresponding 24-view in a static pose or dynamic pose frames generated via a pose-controllable image-to-video model.

This model is trained to disentangle human pose, shape, clothing geometry, and texture. Accordingly, the estimated Gaussians can be animated robustly without post-processing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method.

At present, efficient and scalable verification techniques are always sound but incomplete, and thus, the improvement of verified robustness results is the key criterion to evaluate the performance of incomplete verification approaches. The multi-variate function MaxPool is widely adopted yet challenging to verify. In this paper, we present Ti-Lin, a robustness verifier for MaxPool-based CNNs with Tight Linear Approximation. Following the sequel of minimizing the over-approximation zone of the non-linear function of CNNs, we are the first to propose the provably neuron-wise tightest linear bounds for the MaxPool function. By our proposed linear bounds, we can certify larger robustness results for CNNs. We evaluate the effectiveness of Ti-Lin on different verification frameworks with open-sourced benchmarks, including LeNet, PointNet, and networks trained on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet and ModelNet40 datasets. Experimental results show that Ti-Lin significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across all networks with up to 78.6% improvement in terms of the certified accuracy with almost the same time consumption as the fastest tool.

Based on the DiT video generation model, we propose a memory-efficient control structure with sketch control blocks that predict residual features of skipped DiT blocks. Sketches are drawn on one or two keyframes (at arbitrary time points) for easy interaction. To propagate such temporally sparse sketch conditions across all frames, we propose an inter-frame attention mechanism to analyze the relationship between the keyframes and each video frame. For sketch-based video editing, we design an additional video insertion module that maintains consistency between the newly edited content and the original video's spatial feature and dynamic motion. During inference, we use latent fusion for the accurate preservation of unedited regions.

Previous work has shown that improving uniformity contributes to the learning of under-represented classes. However, most of the previous work focused on classification; the representation space of imbalanced regression remains unexplored. Classification-based methods are not suitable for regression tasks because they cluster features into distinct groups without considering the continuous and ordered nature essential for regression. In a geometric aspect, we uniquely focus on ensuring uniformity in the latent space for imbalanced regression through two key losses: enveloping and homogeneity. The enveloping loss encourages the induced trace to uniformly occupy the surface of a hypersphere, while the homogeneity loss ensures smoothness, with representations evenly spaced at consistent intervals. Our method integrates these geometric principles into the data representations via a Surrogate-driven Representation Learning (SRL) framework. Experiments with real-world regression and operator learning tasks highlight the importance of uniformity in imbalanced regression and validate the efficacy of our geometry-based loss functions",

In contrast, the human visual system performs significant data reduction from the large number of photoreceptors to the optic nerve, effectively encoding visual information into a low-bandwidth latent space representation optimized for brain processing. Inspired by this, we propose a similar approach to advance artificial vision systems. Latent Space Imaging introduces a new paradigm that combines optics and software to encode image information directly into the semantically rich latent space of a generative model. This approach substantially reduces bandwidth and memory demands during image capture and enables a range of downstream tasks focused on the latent space.We validate this principle through an initial hardware prototype based on a single-pixel camera. By implementing an amplitude modulation scheme that encodes into the generative model's latent space, we achieve compression ratios ranging from 1:100 to 1:1000 during imaging, and up to 1:16384 for downstream applications. This approach leverages the model's intrinsic linear boundaries, demonstrating the potential of latent space imaging for highly efficient imaging hardware, adaptable future applications in high-speed imaging, and task-specific cameras with significantly reduced hardware complexity",

The widely used first-order meta-learning algorithms demonstrate strong performance for domain generalization by leveraging the gradient matching theory, which aims to establish balanced parameters across source domains to reduce overfitting to any particular domain. However, our analysis reveals that there are actually numerous directions to achieve gradient matching, with current methods representing just one possible path. These methods actually overlook another critical factor that the balanced parameters should be close to the centroid of optimal parameters of each source domain. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective arithmetic meta-learning with arithmetic-weighted gradients.

While diffusion models (DMs) excel in medical image synthesis, they often struggle to maintain anatomical consistency and utilize the diverse characteristics of multi-contrast MR images effectively. We propose APT, a unified diffusion model designed to generate accurate and anatomically consistent multi-contrast MR images. APT introduces a mutual information fusion module and an anatomical consistency loss to preserve critical anatomical structures across multiple contrast inputs. To enhance synthesis, APT incorporates a two-stage inference process: in the first stage, a prior codebook provides coarse anatomical structures by selecting appropriate guidance based on precomputed similarity mappings and Bezier curve transformations. The second stage applies iterative unrolling with weighted averaging to refine the initial output, enhancing fine anatomical details and ensuring structural consistency. This approach enables the preservation of both global structures and local details, resulting in realistic and diagnostically valuable synthesized images. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MR brain images demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

In this work, we propose to decompose videos into visual primitives -- blob video representation, a general representation for controllable video generation. Based on blob conditions, we develop a blob-grounded video diffusion model named BlobGEN-Vid that allows users to control object motions and fine-grained object appearance. In particular, we introduce a masked 3D attention module that effectively improves regional consistency across frames. In addition, we introduce a learnable module to interpolate text embeddings so that users can control semantics in specific frames and obtain smooth object transitions. We show that our framework is model-agnostic and build BlobGEN-Vid based on both U-Net and DiT-based video diffusion models. Extensive experimental results show that BlobGEN-Vid achieves superior zero-shot video generation ability and state-of-the-art layout controllability on multiple benchmarks. When combined with a Large Language Model for layout planning, our framework even outperforms proprietary text-to-video generators regarding compositional accuracy",

    "abstract": "The current advancements in Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) methods mainly focus on better capturing the spatial and temporal features of facial expressions. However, DFER datasets contain a substantial amount of noisy samples, and few have addressed the issue of handling this noise. We identified two types of noise: one is caused by low-quality data resulting from factors such as occlusion, dim lighting, and blurriness; the other arises from mislabeled data due to annotation bias by annotators. Addressing the two types of noise, we have meticulously crafted a Dynamic Dual-Stage Purification (D2SP) Framework. This initiative aims to dynamically purify the DFER datasets of these two types of noise, ensuring that only high-quality and correctly labeled data is used in the training process. To mitigate low-quality samples, we introduce the Coarse-Grained Pruning (CGP) stage, which computes sample weights and prunes those low-weight samples. After CGP, the Fine-Grained Correction (FGC) stage evaluates prediction stability to correct mislabeled data. Moreover, D2SP is conceived as a general and plug-and-play framework, tailored to integrate seamlessly with prevailing DFER methods. Extensive experiments covering prevalent DFER datasets and deploying multiple benchmark methods have substantiated D2SP's ability to significantly enhance performance metrics",

    "abstract": "As interest grows in world models that predict future states from current observations and actions, accurately modeling part-level dynamics has become increasingly relevant for various applications. Existing approaches, such as Puppet-Master, rely on fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, which are impractical for real-world use due to the limitations of 2D video representation and slow processing times. To overcome these challenges, we present PartRM, a novel 4D reconstruction framework that simultaneously models appearance, geometry, and part-level motion from multi-view images of a static object. PartRM builds upon large 3D Gaussian reconstruction models, leveraging their extensive knowledge of appearance and geometry in static objects. To address data scarcity in 4D, we introduce the PartDrag-4D dataset, providing multi-view observations of part-level dynamics across over 20,000 states. We enhance the model's understanding of interaction conditions with a multi-scale drag embedding module that captures dynamics at varying granularities. To prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, we implement a two-stage training process that focuses sequentially on motion and appearance learning. Experimental results show that PartRM establishes a new state-of-the-art in part-level motion learning and can be applied in manipulation tasks in robotics.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the Large Vision Diffusion Transformer (LaVin-DiT), a scalable and unified foundation model designed to tackle over 20 computer vision tasks in a generative framework. Unlike existing large vision models directly adapted from natural language processing architectures, which rely on less efficient autoregressive techniques and disrupt spatial relationships essential for vision data, LaVin-DiT introduces key innovations to optimize generative performance for vision tasks. First, to address the high dimensionality of visual data, we incorporate a spatial-temporal variational autoencoder that encodes data into a continuous latent space. Second, for generative modeling, we develop a joint diffusion transformer that progressively produces vision outputs. Third, for unified multi-task training, in-context learning is implemented. Input-target pairs serve as task context, which guides the diffusion transformer to align outputs with specific tasks within the latent space. During inference, a task-specific context set and test data as queries allow LaVin-DiT to generalize across tasks without fine-tuning. Trained on extensive vision datasets, the model is scaled from 0.1B to 3.4B parameters, demonstrating substantial scalability and state-of-the-art performance across diverse vision tasks.

While recent methods es- timate part poses and sizes at the category level, they often rely on geometric cues and complex multi-stage pipelines that first segment parts from the point cloud, followed by Normalized Part Coordinate Space (NPCS) estimation for 6D poses. These approaches overlook dense semantic cues from RGB images, leading to suboptimal accuracy, partic- ularly for objects with small parts. To address these limita- tions, we propose a single-stage Network, CAP-Net, for es- timating the 6D poses and sizes of Categorical Articulated Parts. This method combines RGB-D features to generate instance segmentation and NPCS representations for each part in an end-to-end manner. CAP-Net uses a unified net- work to simultaneously predict point-wise class labels, cen- troid offsets, and NPCS maps. A clustering algorithm then groups points of the same predicted class based on their es- timated centroid distances to isolate each part. Finally, the NPCS region of each part is aligned with the point cloud to recover its final pose and size. To bridge the sim-to-real do- main gap, we introduce the RGBD-Art dataset, the largest RGB-D articulated dataset to date, featuring photorealistic RGB images and depth noise simulated from real sensors. Experimental evaluations on the RGBD-Art dataset demon- strate that our method significantly outperforms the state- of-the-art approach.

To address this issue, previous methods attempt to reduce the differences between viewpoints by critical attributes and decoupling the viewpoints. While these methods can mitigate viewpoint differences to some extent, they still face two main issues: (1) difficulty in handling viewpoint diversity and (2) neglect of the contribution of local features. To effectively address these challenges, we design and implement the Self-Calibrating and Adaptive Prompt (SeCap) method for the AGPReID task. The core of this framework relies on the Prompt Re-calibration Module (PRM), which adaptively re-calibrates prompts based on the input. Combined with the Local Feature Refinement Module (LFRM), SeCap can extract view-invariant features from local features for AGPReID. Meanwhile, given the current scarcity of datasets in the AGPReID field, we further contribute two real-world Large-scale Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification datasets, LAGPeR and G2APS-ReID. The former is collected and annotated by us independently, covering 4,231 unique identities and containing 63,841 high-quality images; the latter is reconstructed from the person search dataset G2APS.

Nonetheless, these strategies fail to generalize to novel styles and have technical constraints, particularly in terms of maximum output length and training efficiency. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a novel framework for text-image generation, dubbed Emuru. Our approach leverages a powerful text-image representation model (a variational autoencoder) combined with an autoregressive Transformer. Our approach enables the generation of styled text images conditioned on textual content and style examples, such as specific fonts or handwriting styles. We train our model solely on a diverse, synthetic dataset of English text rendered in over 100,000 typewritten and calligraphy fonts, which gives it the capability to reproduce unseen styles (both fonts and users' handwriting) in zero-shot. To the best of our knowledge, Emuru is the first autoregressive model for HTG, and the first designed specifically for generalization to novel styles. Moreover, our model generates images without background artifacts, which are easier to use for downstream applications.

To address this, we propose the Momentum-Aware Driving (MomAD) framework, which introduces trajectory momentum and perception momentum to stabilize and refine trajectory predictions. MomAD comprises two core components: (1) Topological Trajectory Matching (TTM) employs Hausdorff Distance to select the optimal planning query that aligns with prior paths to ensure coherence; (2) Momentum Planning Interactor (MPI) cross-attends the selected planning query with historical queries to expand static and dynamic perception files. This enriched query, in turn, helps regenerate long-horizon trajectory and reduce collision risks. To mitigate noise arising from dynamic environments and detection errors, we introduce robust instance denoising during training, enabling the planning model to focus on critical signals and improve its robustness. We also propose a novel Trajectory Prediction Consistency (TPC) metric to quantitatively assess planning stability. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MomAD achieves superior long-term consistency (>3s) compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, evaluations on the curated Turning-nuScenes shows that MomAD reduces the collision rate by 26% and improves TPC by 0.97m (33.45%) over a 6s prediction horizon, while closed-loop on Bench2Drive demonstrates an up to 16.3% improvement in success rate",

From this observation, we proposed a meta-score function that searches for local minimum scores near original inputs by applying gradient descent. This procedure enhances the separability between in-distribution (IND) and OOD samples. Importantly, the approach improves OOD detection performance without complex modifications to the underlying model architectures or training protocol. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments using the OpenOOD benchmark. Our approach further pushes the limit of softmax-based OOD detection and is the leading post-hoc method for small-scale models.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.

While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3x speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods.

Additionally, we propose two improvements: a program critic and a program simplifier to improve our method further to synthesize good programs. On three different real world problems, DiSciPLE learns state-of-the-art programs on novel tasks with no prior literature. For example, we can learn programs with 35% lower error than the closest non-interpretable baseline for population density estimation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "High-quality open-source datasets are essential for advancing deep neural networks. However, the unauthorized commercial use of these datasets has raised significant concerns about copyright protection. One promising approach is backdoor watermark-based dataset ownership verification (BW-DOV), in which dataset protectors implant specific backdoors into illicit models through dataset watermarking, enabling the tracing of these models through abnormal prediction behaviors. Unfortunately, the targeted nature of these BW-DOV methods can be maliciously exploited, potentially leading to harmful side effects. While existing harmless methods attempt to mitigate these risks, watermarked datasets can still negatively affect prediction results, partially compromising dataset functionality. In this paper, we propose a more harmless backdoor watermark, called EntropyMark, which improves prediction confidence without altering the final prediction results. For this purpose, an entropy-based constraint is introduced to regulate the probability distribution. Specifically, we design an iterative clean-label dataset watermarking framework. Our framework employs gradient matching and adaptive data selection to optimize backdoor injection. In parallel, we introduce a hypothesis test method grounded in entropy inconsistency to verify dataset ownership. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and defense resistance of our approach",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown remarkable potential for static scene reconstruction, and recent advancements have extended its application to dynamic scenes. However, the quality of reconstructions depends heavily on high-quality input images and precise camera poses, which is not that trivial to fulfill in the real-world scenarios. Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld monocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of both the camera and objects within a single exposure. This combined motion frequently results in image blur that existing methods cannot adequately handle. To address these challenges, we introduce BARD-GS, a novel approach for robust dynamic scene reconstruction that effectively handles blurry inputs and imprecise camera poses. Our method comprises two main components: 1) camera motion deblurring and 2) object motion deblurring. By explicitly decomposing motion blur into camera motion blur and object motion blur and modeling them separately, we achieve significantly improved rendering results in dynamic regions. In addition, we collect a real-world motion blur dataset of dynamic scenes to evaluate our approach.

Current generated image detection methods based on large-scale pre-trained multimodal models have achieved impressive results. Although these models provide abundant features, the authentication task-related features are often submerged. Consequently, those authentication task-irrelated features cause models to learn superficial biases, thereby harming their generalization performance across different model genera (e.g., GANs and Diffusion Models). To this end, we proposed VIB-Net, which uses Variational Information Bottlenecks to enforce authentication task-related feature learning. We tested and analyzed the proposed method and existing methods on samples generated by 17 different generative models. Compared to SOTA methods, VIB-Net achieved a 5.55% improvement in mAP and a 9.33% increase in accuracy. Notably, in generalization tests on unseen generative models from different series, VIB-Net improved mAP by 12.48% and accuracy by 23.59% over SOTA methods.

To alleviate above problems, we propose Holistic Style Injector (HSI), a novel attention-style transformation module to deliver artistic expression of target style. Specifically, HSI performs stylization only based on global style representation that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer, to avoid generating local disharmonious patterns in stylized images. Moreover, we propose a dual relation learning mechanism inside the HSI to dynamically render images by leveraging semantic similarity in content and style, ensuring the stylized images preserve the original content and improve style fidelity. Note that the proposed HSI achieves linear computational complexity because it establishes feature mapping through element-wise multiplication rather than matrix multiplication.

In this paper, we revisit these famous optical illusions with a generative twist. With the help of latent rectified flow models, we propose a method to create anamorphic images that still retain a valid interpretation when viewed directly. To this end, we introduce Laplacian Pyramid Warping, a frequency-aware image warping technique key to generating high-quality visuals.

However, existing LFM reconstruction algorithms are highly sensitive to sensor noise or require hard-to-get ground-truth annotated data for training. To address these challenges, this paper introduces V2V3D, an unsupervised view2view-based framework that establishes a new paradigm for joint optimization of image denoising and 3D reconstruction in a unified architecture. We assume that the LF images are derived from a consistent 3D signal, with the noise in each view being independent. This enables V2V3D to incorporate the principle of noise2noise for effective denoising. To enhance the recovery of high-frequency details, we propose a novel wave-optics-based feature alignment technique, which transforms the point spread function, used for forward propagation in wave optics, into convolution kernels specifically designed for feature alignment. Moreover, we introduce an LFM dataset containing LF images and their corresponding 3D intensity volumes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves high computational efficiency and outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods.

However, synthesizing novel views from these panoramic images in real time remains a significant challenge, especially due to panoramic imagery's high resolution and inherent distortions. Although existing 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) methods can produce photo-realistic views under narrow baselines, they often overfit the training views when dealing with wide-baseline panoramic images due to the difficulty in learning precise geometry from sparse 360^ \\circ views. This paper presents Splatter-360, a novel end-to-end generalizable 3DGS framework designed to handle wide-baseline panoramic images. Unlike previous approaches, Splatter-360 performs multi-view matching directly in the spherical domain by constructing a spherical cost volume through a spherical sweep algorithm, enhancing the network's depth perception and geometry estimation. Additionally, we introduce a 3D-aware bi-projection encoder to mitigate the distortions inherent in panoramic images and integrate cross-view attention to improve feature interactions across multiple viewpoints. This enables robust 3D-aware feature representations and real-time rendering capabilities. Experimental results on the HM3D and Replica demonstrate that Splatter-360 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art NeRF and 3DGS methods (e.g., PanoGRF, MVSplat, DepthSplat, and HiSplat) in both synthesis quality and generalization performance for wide-baseline panoramic images.

To address these issues, we present ShowMak3r, a comprehensive reconstruction pipeline that allows the editing of scenes like how video clips are made in a production control room. In ShowMak3r, a 3DLocator module locates recovered actors on the stage using depth prior, and estimates unseen human poses via interpolation.

    "abstract": "Figure skating, known as the \"Art on Ice,\" is among the most artistic sports, challenging to understand due to its blend of technical elements (like jumps and spins) and overall artistic expression. Existing figure skating datasets mainly focus on single tasks, such as action recognition or scoring, lacking comprehensive annotations for both technical and artistic evaluation. Current sports research is largely centered on ball games, with limited relevance to artistic sports like figure skating. To address this, we introduce FSAnno, a large-scale dataset advancing artistic sports understanding through figure skating. FSAnno includes an open-access training and test dataset, alongside a benchmark dataset, FSBench, for fair model evaluation. FSBench consists of FSBench-Text, with multiple-choice questions and explanations, and FSBench-Motion, containing multimodal data and Question and Answer (QA) pairs, supporting tasks from technical analysis to performance commentary. Initial tests on FSBench reveal significant limitations in existing models' understanding of artistic sports. We hope FSBench will become a key tool for evaluating and enhancing model comprehension of figure skating. All data, models, and more details are available at: https://github.com/Moomin-Fin/Ano",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal semantic segmentation is a critical challenge in computer vision, with early methods suffering from high computational costs and limited transferability due to full fine-tuning of RGB-based pre-trained parameters. Recent studies, while leveraging additional modalities as supplementary prompts to RGB, still predominantly rely on RGB, which restricts the full potential of other modalities. To address these issues, we propose a novel symmetric parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multimodal segmentation, featuring with a modality-aware prompting and adaptation scheme, to simultaneously adapt the capabilities of a powerful pre-trained model to both RGB and X modalities. Furthermore, prevalent approaches use the global cross-modality correlations of attention mechanism for modality fusion, which inadvertently introduces noise across modalities. To mitigate this noise, we propose a dynamic sparse cross-modality fusion module to facilitate effective and efficient cross-modality fusion. To further strengthen the above two modules, we propose a training strategy that leverages accurately predicted dual-modality results to self-teach the single-modality outcomes. In comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches across six multimodal segmentation scenarios with minimal computation cost",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the typical inversion-then-editing paradigm using text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated promising results, directly extending it to text-to-video (T2V) models still suffers severe artifacts such as color flickering and content distortion. Consequently, current video editing methods primarily rely on T2I models, which inherently lack temporal-coherence generative ability, often resulting in inferior editing results. In this paper, we attribute the failure of the typical editing paradigm to: 1) Tightly Spatial-temporal Coupling. The vanilla pivotal-based inversion strategy struggles to disentangle spatial-temporal information in the video diffusion model; 2) Complicated Spatial-temporal Layout. The vanilla cross-attention control strategy is deficient in preserving the unedited content. To address these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled guidance (STDG) and multi-frame null-text optimization strategy to provide pivotal temporal cues for more precise pivotal inversion. Furthermore, we introduce a self-attention control strategy to maintain higher fidelity for precise partial content editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method (termed VideoDirector) effectively harnesses the powerful temporal generation capabilities of T2V models, producing edited videos with state-of-the-art performance in accuracy, motion smoothness, realism, and fidelity to unedited content",

Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively leveraged for this task, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in generating contextually appropriate listener behaviors.

In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses these limitations while maintaining the advantages of LLMs. Our approach introduces a Multimodal-LM architecture that jointly processes speech content, acoustics, and speaker emotion, capturing the full spectrum of communication cues. Additionally, we propose an identity disentanglement strategy using instance normalization and adaptive instance normalization in a VQ-VAE framework, enabling high-fidelity listening head synthesis with flexible identity control.

Our method targets unconstrained settings, including cases where close-up views of the subject's eyes are unavailable, such as when the subject is distant or facing away. Previous approaches typically rely on either 2D appearance alone or incorporate limited spatial cues using depth maps in the non-learnable post-processing step. Estimating 3D gaze direction from 2D observations in these scenarios is challenging; variations in subject pose, scene layout, and gaze direction, combined with differing camera poses, yield diverse 2D appearances and 3D gaze directions even when targeting the same 3D scene. To address this issue, we propose GA3CE: Gaze-Aware 3D Context Encoding. Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions, treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space. Inspired by human vision, we align this context in an egocentric space, significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore, we propose D^3 (direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and distance space.

    "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have achieved significant advances in vision, text, and robotics. However, they still face slow generation speeds due to sequential denoising processes. To address this, a parallel sampling method based on Picard iteration was introduced, effectively reducing sequential steps while ensuring exact convergence to the original output. Nonetheless, Picard iteration does not guarantee faster convergence, which can still result in slow generation in practice. In this work, we propose a new parallelization scheme, the Picard Consistency Model (PCM), which significantly reduces the number of generation steps in Picard iteration. Inspired by the consistency model, PCM is directly trained to predict the fixed-point solution, or the final output, at any stage of the convergence trajectory. Additionally, we introduce a new concept called model switching, which addresses PCM's limitations and ensures exact convergence.

    "abstract": "Recent works have established that AI models introduce spectral artifacts into generated images and propose approaches for learning to capture them using labeled data. However, the significant differences in such artifacts among different generative models hinder these approaches from generalizing to generators not seen during training. In this work, we build upon the key idea that the spectral distribution of real images constitutes both an invariant and highly discriminative pattern for AI-generated image detection. To model this under a self-supervised setup, we employ masked spectral learning using the pretext task of frequency reconstruction. Since generated images constitute out-of-distribution samples for this model, we propose spectral reconstruction similarity to capture this divergence. Moreover, we introduce spectral context attention, which enables our approach to efficiently capture subtle spectral inconsistencies in images of any resolution. Our spectral AI-generated image detection approach (SPAI) achieves a 5.5% absolute improvement in AUC over the previous state-of-the-art across 13 recent generative approaches, while exhibiting robustness against common online perturbations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of understanding various data modalities, including text, images, and videos. LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected tokens is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models. The code is available here",

In this work, we propose the first method to this important yet unresolved issue, called Training data Provenance Verification (TrainProVe).

We validate the efficacy of TrainProVe across four text-to-image models (Stable Diffusion v1.4, latent consistency model, PixArt-\\alpha, and Stable Cascade).

    "abstract": "Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs, vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the model's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video benchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "Video frame interpolation (VFI) that leverages the bio-inspired event cameras as guidance has recently shown better performance and memory efficiency than the frame-based methods, thanks to the event cameras' advantages, such as high temporal resolution. A hurdle for event-based VFI is how to effectively deal with non-linear motion, caused by the dynamic changes in motion direction and speed within the scene. Existing methods either use events to estimate sparse optical flow or fuse events with image features to estimate dense optical flow. Unfortunately, motion errors often degrade the VFI quality as the continuous motion cues from events do not align with the dense spatial information of images in the temporal dimension. In this paper, we find that object motion is continuous in space, tracking local regions over continuous time enables more accurate identification of spatiotemporal feature correlations. In light of this, we propose a novel continuous point tracking-based VFI framework, named TimeTracker. Specifically, we first design a Scene-Aware Region Segmentation (SARS) module to divide the scene into similar patches. Then, a Continuous Trajectory guided Motion Estimation (CTME) module is proposed to track the continuous motion trajectory of each patch through events. Finally, intermediate frames at any given time are generated through global motion optimization and frame refinement. Moreover, we collect a real-world dataset that features fast non-linear motion.

Existing methods apply data augmentation, noise injection and pre-trained models to maximumly increase the number of training samples thus improving the training of DE-GANs. However, none of these methods considers the sample quality during training, which can also significantly influence the training of DE-GANs. Focusing on sample quality during training, in this paper, we are the first to incorporate discriminator rejection sampling (DRS) into the training process and introduce a novel method, called quality aware dynamic discriminator rejection sampling (QADDRS). Specifically, QADDRS consists of two steps: (1) the sample quality aware step, which aims to obtain the sorted critic scores, i.e., the ordered discriminator outputs, on real/fake samples in the current training stage; (2) the dynamic rejection step that obtains dynamic rejection number N, where N is controlled by the overfitting degree of discriminator (D) during training. When updating the parameters of D, the N high critic score real samples and the N low critic score fake samples in the minibatch are rejected dynamically based on the overfitting degree of D. As a result, QADDRS can avoid D becoming overly confident in distinguishing both real and fake samples, thereby alleviating the overfitting of D issue during training. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that integrating QADDRS into different DE-GANs can achieve better performance and deliver state-of-the-art results.

Traditional metrics, e.g., SSIM or optical flow, are hard to generalize to arbitrary videos, while, it is very tough for human annotators to label the abstract motion intensity neither. Furthermore, the motion intensity shall reveal both local object motion and global camera movement, which has not been studied before. This paper addresses the challenge with a new motion estimator, capable of measuring the decoupled motion intensities of objects and cameras in video. We leverage the contrastive learning on randomly paired videos and distinguish the video with greater motion intensity. Such a paradigm is friendly for annotation and easy to scale up to achieve stable performance on motion estimation. We then present a new I2V model, named MotionStone, developed with the decoupled motion estimator.

Though MAE is straightforward and recognized for its robustness, it is rarely used in noisy-label learning due to its slow convergence and poor performance outside prompt learning scenarios. To elucidate the robustness of PromptMAE, we leverage feature learning theory to show that MAE can suppress the influence of noisy samples, thereby improving the signal-to-noise ratio and enhancing overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce PromptOT, a prompt-based optimal transport data purification method to enhance the robustness further. PromptOT employs text encoder representations in vision-language models as prototypes to construct an optimal transportation matrix. This matrix effectively partitions datasets into clean and noisy subsets, allowing for the application of cross-entropy loss to the clean subset and MAE loss to the noisy subset.

To address this limitation, we present an inverse rendering (IR) model capable of jointly estimating scene geometry, materials, and illumination.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input, where _small_ is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the l_p norm, where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur, compression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such treat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \\texttt Projected Displacement (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with _unsafe directions_, defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way, the PD-threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. The PD-threat model is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing robustness pipelines. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes _safe_ perturbations of large l_p norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and compression, while simultaneously excluding _unsafe_ perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models, the PD-threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task information such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners a flexible, task-driven threat specification that alleviates the limitations of l_p-threat models",

    "title": "No Pains, More Gains: Recycling Sub-Salient Patches for Efficient High-Resolution Image Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, many notable methods have emerged to tackle the computational resource challenge of the high resolution image recognition (HRIR). They typically focus on identifying and aggregating a few salient regions for classification, discarding sub-salient areas for low training consumption. Nevertheless, many HRIR tasks necessitate the exploration of wider regions to model objects and contexts, which limits their performance in such scenarios. To address this issue, we present a DBPS strategy to enable training with more patches at low consumption. Specifically, in addition to a fundamental buffer that stores the embeddings of most salient patches, DBPS further employs an auxiliary buffer to recycle those sub-salient ones. To reduce the computational cost associated with gradients of sub-salient patches, these patches are primarily used in the forward pass to provide sufficient information for classification. Meanwhile, only the gradients of the salient patches are back-propagated to update the entire network. Moreover, we design a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) architecture that leverages aggregated information from salient patches to filter out uninformative background within sub-salient patches for better accuracy. Besides, we introduce the random patch drop to accelerate training process and uncover informative regions. Experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of both accuracy and training consumption against other advanced methods.

In this work, we propose the Generalizable Scene Change Detection Framework (GeSCF), which addresses unseen domain performance and temporal consistency---to meet the growing demand for anything SCD. Our method leverages the pre-trained Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a zero-shot manner. For this, we design Initial Pseudo-mask Generation and Geometric-Semantic Mask Matching---seamlessly turning user-guided prompt and single-image based segmentation into scene change detection for a pair of inputs without guidance. Furthermore, we define the Generalizable Scene Change Detection (GeSCD) benchmark along with novel metrics and an evaluation protocol to facilitate SCD research in generalizability. In the process, we introduce the ChangeVPR dataset, a collection of challenging image pairs with diverse environmental scenarios---including urban, suburban, and rural settings. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that GeSCF achieves an average performance gain of 19.2% on existing SCD datasets and 30.0% on the ChangeVPR dataset, nearly doubling the prior art performance.

    "abstract": "In real-world AI applications, training datasets are often contaminated, containing a mix of in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples without labels. This contamination poses a significant challenge for developing and training OOD detection models, as nearly all existing methods assume access to a clean training dataset of only ID samples--a condition rarely met in real-world scenarios. Customizing each existing OOD detection method to handle such contamination is impractical, given the vast number of diverse methods designed for clean data. To address this issue, we propose a universal, model-agnostic framework that integrates with nearly all existing OOD detection methods, enabling training on contaminated datasets while achieving high OOD detection accuracy on test datasets. Additionally, our framework provides an accurate estimation of the unknown proportion of OOD samples within the training dataset--an important and distinct challenge in its own right. Our approach introduces a novel dynamic weighting function and transition mechanism within an iterative training structure, enabling both reliable estimation of the OOD sample proportion of the training data and precise OOD detection on test data.

LS3M excels at efficiently modeling long-range dependencies based on the Mamba design, while incorporating differentiable permutation matrices that reorder input sequences based on modality-specific characteristics. This dynamic reordering ensures that critical spatial inductive biases and long-range semantic correlations inherent in 3D brain MRI are preserved, which is crucial for imcomplete multi-modal brain tumor segmentation.Once the input sequences are reordered using the generated permutation matrix, the Series State Space Model (S3M) block models the relationships between them, capturing both local and long-range dependencies. This enables effective representation of intra-modal and inter-modal relationships, significantly improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2018 and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate that LS3M outperforms existing methods, offering a robust solution for brain tumor segmentation, particularly in scenarios with missing modalities",

However, data heterogeneity resulting from differences across user behaviors, preferences, and device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated learning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights, relying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to unstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies have sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset characteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation weights while ensuring data security--without requiring additional proxy data--remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated learning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that adaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the learning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates, reflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation weight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning higher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the global optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization of the global model. Extensive experiments under diverse scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our method, providing a promising solution to the challenges of data heterogeneity in federated learning",

However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution.

In order to bring texture features while preventing content leakage, we filter content-related patches while retaining style ones based on prompt-patch similarity; for global style extraction, we generate a paired style dataset through model illusion to facilitate contrastive learning, which greatly enhances the absolute style consistency. Moreover, to fill in the image-to-video gap, we train a lightweight motion adapter on still videos, which implicitly enhances stylization extent, and enables our image-trained model to be seamlessly applied to videos. Benefited from these efforts, our approach, StyleMaster, not only achieves significant improvement in both style resemblance and temporal coherence, but also can easily generalize to video style transfer with a gray tile ControlNet.

This problem, known as Unsupervised Continual Domain Shift Learning (UCDSL), poses practical difficulties.

However, due to the existence of adaptivity gap, the invariant representation may theoretically lead to large joint errors. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel UCDSL method, called Multi-Prototype Modeling (MPM). Our model comprises two key components: (1) Multi-Prototype Learning (MPL) for acquiring domain-specific representations using multiple domain-specific prototypes. MPL achieves domain-specific error minimization instead of enforcing feature alignment across different domains. (2) Bi-Level Graph Enhancer (BiGE) for enhancing domain-level and category-level representations, resulting in more accurate predictions.

However, these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content, and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load, significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF), a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers, where modality fusion predominantly occurs. This approach enables more effective capture of visual features, reducing the model's bias toward language modality. Experimental results demonstrate that VAF significantly reduces hallucinations across various MLLMs without affecting inference speed, while maintaining coherence and accuracy in generated outputs",

    "abstract": "As scaling laws in generative AI push performance, they simultaneously concentrate the development of these models among actors with large computational resources. With a focus on text-to-image (T2I) generative models, we aim to unlock this bottleneck by demonstrating very low-cost training of large-scale T2I diffusion transformer models. As the computational cost of transformers increases with the number of patches in each image, we propose randomly masking up to 75% of the image patches during training. We propose a deferred masking strategy that preprocesses all patches using a patch-mixer before masking, thus significantly reducing the performance degradation with masking, making it superior to model downscaling in reducing computational cost. We also incorporate the latest improvements in transformer architecture, such as the use of mixture-of-experts layers, to improve performance and further identify the critical benefit of using synthetic images in micro-budget training. Finally, using only 37M publicly available real and synthetic images, we train a 1.16 billion parameter sparse transformer with only 1,890 USD economical cost and achieve a 12.7 FID in zero-shot generation on the COCO dataset. Notably, our model achieves competitive performance across both automated and human-centric evaluations, as well as high-quality generations, while incurring 118xlower costs than Stable Diffusion models and 14xlower costs than the current state-of-the-art approach, which costs \\28,400. We also further investigate the influence of synthetic images on performance and demonstrate that micro-budget training on only synthetic images is sufficient for achieving high-quality data generation.

Existing methods often rely on simplified object representations, such as the object's centroid or the nearest point to a human, to achieve physically plausible motions.

To address this limitation, we introduce ROG, a novel diffusion-based framework that models the spatiotemporal relationships inherent in HOIs with rich geometric detail. For efficient object representation, we select boundary-focused and fine-detail key points from the object mesh, ensuring a comprehensive depiction of the object's geometry. This representation is used to construct an interactive distance field (IDF), capturing the robust HOI dynamics. Furthermore, we develop a diffusion-based relation model that integrates spatial and temporal attention mechanisms, enabling a better understanding of intricate HOI relationships. This relation model refines the generated motion's IDF, guiding the motion generation process to produce relation-aware and semantically aligned movements. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ROG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the realism and semantic accuracy of synthesized HOIs. This paper's code will be released",

Moreover, TacoDepth can be flexible for different inference modes, providing a better balance of speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our method.

However, previous Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) methods leverage the pose cues implicitly, resulting in implausible predictions. To address this, we propose Locomotion Embodiment, a framework that explicitly evaluates the physical plausibility of the predicted trajectory by locomotion generation under the laws of physics. While the plausibility of locomotion is learned with an indifferentiable physics simulator, it is replaced by our differentiable Locomotion Value function to train an HTP network in a data-driven manner. In particular, our proposed Embodied Locomotion loss is beneficial for efficiently training a stochastic HTP network using multiple heads. Furthermore, the Locomotion Value filter is proposed to filter out implausible trajectories at inference.

This method proposes a primitive-aware multi-view diffusion model, which perceives both local geometry and high-level structural semantics during the generation process. We encode primitive semantics into the color domain, and enforce the strong priors in pre-trained diffusion models to align with the well-defined primitives. As a result, we can infer multi-view normal maps and semantic maps from a single image, thereby reconstructing a mesh with primitive labels. Correspondingly, we propose a set of fitting and optimization methods to deal with the inevitable noise and distortion in generated primitives, ultimately producing a complete and seamless Boundary Representation (B-rep) of a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively recover high-quality CAD objects from single-view images.

Effective IP protection extends beyond ensuring authorized usage; it also necessitates restricting model deployment to authorized data domains, particularly when the model is fine-tuned for specific target domains. However, current IP protection methods often rely solely on the visual backbone, which may lack sufficient semantic richness. To bridge this gap, we introduce IP-CLIP, a lightweight IP protection strategy tailored to CLIP, employing a prompt-based learning approach. By leveraging the frozen visual backbone of CLIP, we extract both image style and content information, incorporating them into the learning of IP prompt. This strategy acts as a robust barrier, effectively preventing the unauthorized transfer of features from authorized domains to unauthorized ones. Additionally, we propose a style-enhancement branch that constructs feature banks for both authorized and unauthorized domains. This branch integrates self-enhanced and cross-domain features, further strengthening IP-CLIP's capability to block features from unauthorized domains. Finally, we present new three metrics designed to better balance the performance degradation of authorized and unauthorized domains.

In this work, we introduce a novel black-box detection framework that requires only API access, sidestepping the need for model weights or large auxiliary datasets. Our approach leverages a corrupt-and-recover strategy: by masking part of an image and assessing the model's ability to reconstruct it, we measure the likelihood that the image was generated by the model itself. For black-box models that do not support masked-image inputs, we incorporate a cost-efficient surrogate model trained to align with the target model's distribution, enhancing detection capability.

Open World Object Detection (OWOD) and Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) are two main research directions, each addressing unique challenges in dynamic environments. However, existing studies often focus on only one of these tasks, leaving the combined challenges of OWOD and OVD largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel detector, OW-OVD, which inherits the zero-shot generalization capability of OVD detectors while incorporating the ability to actively detect unknown objects and progressively optimize performance through incremental learning, as seen in OWOD detectors. To achieve this, we start with a standard OVD detector and adapt it for OWOD tasks. For attribute selection, we propose the Visual Similarity Attribute Selection (VSAS) method, which identifies the most generalizable attributes by computing similarity distributions across annotated and unannotated regions. Additionally, to ensure the diversity of attributes, we incorporate a similarity constraint in the iterative process. Finally, to preserve the standard inference process of OVD, we propose the Hybrid Attribute-Uncertainty Fusion (HAUF) method. This method combines attribute similarity with known class uncertainty to infer the likelihood of an object belonging to an unknown class. We validated the effectiveness of OW-OVD through evaluations on two OWOD benchmarks, M-OWODB and S-OWODB. The results demonstrate that OW-OVD outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving a +15.3 improvement in unknown object recall (U-Recall) and a +15.5 increase in unknown class average precision (U-mAP).

    "abstract": "Recently, Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge, so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand, pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability, but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper, we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically, we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP), which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then, we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model, thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our proposed DMP-DUN achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires at least only 2 steps to reconstruct the image.

To address these challenges, we introduce Koala-36M, a large-scale, high-quality video dataset featuring accurate temporal splitting, detailed captions, and superior video quality. The essence of our approach lies in improving the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content. Specifically, we employ a linear classifier on probability distributions to enhance the accuracy of transition detection, ensuring better temporal consistency. We then provide structured captions for the splitted videos, with an average length of 200 words, to improve text-video alignment. Additionally, we develop a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) that integrates multiple sub-metrics, allowing us to filter high-quality videos from the original corpus. Finally, we incorporate several metrics into the training process of the generation model, further refining the fine-grained conditions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our data processing pipeline and the quality of the proposed Koala-36M dataset.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) may produce outputs that are unfaithful to reality, also known as visual hallucinations (VH), which significantly impedes their real-world usage. To alleviate VH, various decoding strategies have been proposed to enhance visual information. However, many of these methods may require secondary decoding and rollback, which significantly reduces inference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient plug-and-play decoding algorithm via Visual-Aware Sparsification (VASparse) from the perspective of token sparsity for mitigating VH. VASparse is inspired by empirical observations: (1) the sparse activation of attention in LVLMs, and (2) visual-agnostic tokens sparsification exacerbates VH. Based on these insights, we propose a novel token sparsification strategy that balances efficiency and trustworthiness. Specifically, VASparse implements a visual-aware token selection strategy during decoding to reduce redundant tokens while preserving visual context effectively. Additionally, we innovatively introduce a sparse-based visual contrastive decoding method to recalibrate the distribution of hallucinated outputs without the time overhead associated with secondary decoding. Subsequently, VASparse recalibrates attention scores to penalize attention sinking of LVLMs towards text tokens. Extensive experiments across four popular benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of VASparse in mitigating VH across different LVLM families without requiring additional training or post-processing. Impressively, VASparse achieves state-of-the-art performance for mitigating VH while maintaining competitive decoding speed. Code is available at https://github.com/mengchuang123/VASparse-github",

Existing approaches require prompt tuning or architectural adaptations, limiting zero-shot applicability. Our work proposes a novel solution treating VLMs as black boxes, leveraging scores without training data or ground truth. We make two contributions. First, we find that VLM scores suffer from image- and prompt-specific biases, and that simple standardization is surprisingly effective at removing these and boosting MLR performance. And second, we introduce compound prompts grounded in realistic object combinations. Our analysis reveals \"AND\"/\"OR\" signal ambiguities that cause maximum compound scores to be surprisingly suboptimal compared to second-highest scores. We introduce an adaptive fusion method to address this issue. Our method enhances other zero-shot approaches, consistently improving their results.

Existing zero-shot methods build inference framework upon large language models (LLM) for specific tasks, which differs a lot in overall pipeline and fails to generalize across different types of goal. Towards the aim of universal zero-shot navigation, we propose a uniform graph representation to unify different goals, including object category, instance image and text description. We also convert the observation of agent into an online maintained scene graph. With this consistent scene and goal representation, we preserve most structural information compared with pure text and are able to leverage LLM for explicit graph-based reasoning.Specifically, we conduct graph matching between the scene graph and goal graph at each time instant and propose different strategies to generate long-term goal of exploration according to different matching states. The agent first iteratively searches subgraph of goal when zero-matched. With partial matching, the agent then utilizes coordinate projection and anchor pair alignment to infer the goal location. Finally scene graph correction and goal verification are applied for perfect matching. We also present a blacklist mechanism to enable robust switch between stages.Extensive experiments on several benchmarks show that our UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on three studied navigation tasks with a single model, even outperforming task-specific zero-shot methods and supervised universal methods",

To alleviate this limitation, we introduce Siamese-Diffusion, a novel dual-component model comprising Mask-Diffusion and Image-Diffusion.

During sampling, only Mask-Diffusion is used, ensuring diversity and scalability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, privacy risks, particularly Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a specific data point belongs to a target client's training set, remain a significant concern. Existing methods for implementing MIAs in FL primarily analyze updates from the target client, focusing on metrics such as loss, gradient norm, and gradient difference. However, these methods fail to leverage updates from non-target clients, potentially underutilizing available information.In this paper, we first formulate a one-tailed likelihood-ratio hypothesis test based on the likelihood of updates from non-target clients. Building upon this formulation, we introduce a three-stage Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method, called FedMIA, which follows the \"all for one\"--leveraging updates from all clients across multiple communication rounds to enhance MIA effectiveness. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedMIA outperforms existing MIAs in both classification and generative tasks. Additionally, it can be integrated as an extension to existing methods and is robust against various defense strategies, Non-IID data, and different federated structures.

    "abstract": "Erase inpainting, or object removal, aims to precisely remove target objects within masked regions while preserving the overall consistency of the surrounding content. Despite diffusion-based methods have made significant strides in the field of image inpainting, challenges remain regarding the emergence of unexpected objects or artifacts. We assert that the inexact diffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms constrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the potential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In contrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization paradigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the erasure results.We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO) paradigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with the objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion transition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during optimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object removal. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the sampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention (SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering self-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts while further enhancing the coherence of the generated content. With this design, our proposed EraDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages V5 dataset and demonstrates significant superiority in real-world scenarios",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a simple approach to make pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) interpretable for fine-grained analysis, aiming to identify and localize the traits that distinguish visually similar categories, such as bird species. Pre-trained ViTs, such as DINO, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in extracting localized, discriminative features. However, saliency maps like Grad-CAM often fail to identify these traits, producing blurred, coarse heatmaps that highlight entire objects instead. We propose a novel approach, Prompt Class Attention Map (Prompt-CAM), to address this limitation. Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image, the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images (i.e., traits). As a result, the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise, Prompt-CAM is almost a \"free lunch,\" requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply, in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g., birds, fishes, insects, fungi, flowers, food, and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.

However, optical flow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to large inputs due to their rigid architectures.

There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the actual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous works only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked samples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways.

In this work, we introduce Spatiotemporal Skip Guidance (STG), a simple training-free sampling guidance method for enhancing transformer-based video diffusion models.

We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations.VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement.

This paper introduces Scale AutoRegressive 3D (SAR3D), a novel framework that leverages a multi-scale 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) to tokenize 3D objects for efficient autoregressive generation and detailed understanding. By predicting the next scale in a multi-scale latent representation instead of the next single token, SAR3D reduces generation time significantly, achieving fast 3D object generation in just 0.82 seconds on an A6000 GPU. Additionally, given the tokens enriched with hierarchical 3D-aware information, we finetune a pretrained LLM on them, enabling multimodal comprehension of 3D content.Our experiments show that SAR3D surpasses current 3D generation methods in both speed and quality and allows LLMs to interpret and caption 3D models comprehensively",

    "abstract": "The performance of anomaly inspection in industrial manufacturing is constrained by the scarcity of anomaly data. To overcome this challenge, researchers have started employing anomaly generation approaches to augment the anomaly dataset. However, existing anomaly generation methods suffer from limited diversity in the generated anomalies and struggle to achieve a seamless blending of this anomaly with the original image. Moreover, the generated mask is usually not aligned with the generated anomaly. In this paper, we overcome these challenges from a new perspective, simultaneously generating a pair of the overall image and the corresponding anomaly part. We propose DualAnoDiff, a novel diffusion-based few-shot anomaly image generation model, which can generate diverse and realistic anomaly images by using a dual-interrelated diffusion model, where one of them is employed to generate the whole image while the other one generates the anomaly part. Moreover, we extract background and shape information to mitigate the distortion and blurriness phenomenon in few-shot image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, realism and the accuracy of mask. Overall, our approach significantly improves the performance of downstream anomaly inspection tasks, including anomaly detection, anomaly localization, and anomaly classification tasks.

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating hallucinations are generally static, which may overlook the potential risk of data contamination. To address this issue, we propose ODE, an open-set, dynamic protocol designed to evaluate object hallucinations in MLLMs at both the existence and attribute levels. ODE employs a graph-based structure to represent real-world object concepts, their attributes, and the distributional associations between them. This structure facilitates the extraction of concept combinations based on diverse distributional criteria, generating varied samples for structured queries that evaluate hallucinations in both generative and discriminative tasks. Through the generation of new samples, dynamic concept combinations, and varied distribution frequencies, ODE mitigates the risk of data contamination and broadens the scope of evaluation. This protocol is applicable to both general and specialized scenarios, including those with limited data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol, revealing that MLLMs exhibit higher hallucination rates when evaluated with ODE-generated samples, which indicates potential data contamination. Furthermore, these generated samples aid in analyzing hallucination patterns and fine-tuning models, offering an effective approach to mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs",

    "abstract": "Spike camera is a kind of neuromorphic camera with ultra-high temporal resolution, which can capture dynamic scenes by continuously firing spike signals. To capture color information, a color filter array (CFA) is employed on the sensor of the spike camera, resulting in Bayer-pattern spike streams. How to restore high-quality color images from the binary spike signals remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a motion-guided reconstruction method for spike cameras with CFA, utilizing color layout and estimated motion information. Specifically, we develop a joint motion estimation pipeline for the Bayer-pattern spike stream, exploiting the motion consistency of channels. We propose to estimate the missing pixels of each color channel according to temporally neighboring pixels of the corresponding color along the motion trajectory. As the spike signals are read out at discrete time points, there is quantization noise that impacts the image quality. Thus, we analyze the correlation of the noise in spatial and temporal domains and propose a self-supervised network utilizing a masked spike encoder to handle the noise. Experiments on real-world captured Bayer-pattern spike streams show that our method can restore color images with better visual quality, compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Recent concept-based methods link the model predictions with interpretable concepts and modify their activation scores to interact with the model.

Alternatively, prototype-based methods learn representations from training image patches and compare these with test image patches, using the similarity scores for final class prediction. However, interpreting the underlying concepts of these patches can be challenging and often necessitates post-hoc guesswork. To address this issue, this paper introduces the novel Concept-based Similarity Reasoning network (CSR), which offers (i) patch-level prototype with intrinsic concept interpretation, and (ii) spatial interactivity. First, the proposed CSR provides localized explanation by grounding prototypes of each concept on image regions. Second, our model introduces novel spatial-level interaction, allowing doctors to engage directly with specific image areas, making it an intuitive and transparent tool for medical imaging. CSR improves upon prior state-of-the-art interpretable methods by up to 4.% across three biomedical datasets",

Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, design decoration, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training",

However, supervised learning still faces a challenge in adopting masking augmentations, primarily due to unstable training. In this paper, we propose a novel way to involve masking augmentations dubbed Masked Sub-branch (MaskSub). MaskSub consists of the main-branch and sub-branch, the latter being a part of the former. The main-branch undergoes conventional training recipes, while the sub-branch merits intensive masking augmentations, during training. MaskSub tackles the challenge by mitigating adverse effects through a relaxed loss function similar to a self-distillation loss. Our analysis shows that MaskSub improves performance, with the training loss converging faster than in standard training, which suggests our method stabilizes the training process. We further validate MaskSub across diverse training scenarios and models, including DeiT-III training, MAE finetuning, CLIP finetuning, BERT training, and hierarchical architectures (ResNet and Swin Transformer). Our results show that MaskSub consistently achieves impressive performance gains across all the cases. MaskSub provides a practical and effective solution for introducing additional regularization under various training recipes. Code available at https://github.com/naver-ai/augsub",

Additionally, MLLM may lack fine-grained perception of visual features, which can result in hallucinations during reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Notes-guided MLLM Reasoning (NoteMR), a novel framework that guides MLLM in better reasoning by utilizing knowledge notes and visual notes. Specifically, we initially obtain explicit knowledge from an external knowledge base. Then, this explicit knowledge, combined with images, is used to assist the MLLM in generating knowledge notes. These notes are designed to filter explicit knowledge and identify relevant internal implicit knowledge within the MLLM. We then identify highly correlated regions between the images and knowledge notes, retaining them as image notes to enhance the model's fine-grained perception, thereby mitigating MLLM induced hallucinations. Finally, both notes are fed into the MLLM, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the image-question pair and enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "State Space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their unique ability of modeling global relationships with linear complexity. SSMs are specifically designed to capture spatially proximate relationships of image patches. However, they fail to identify relationships between conceptually related yet not adjacent patches. This limitation arises from the non-causal nature of image data, which lacks inherent directional relationships. Additionally, current vision-based SSMs are highly sensitive to transformations such as rotation. Their predefined scanning directions depend on the original image orientation, which can cause the model to produce inconsistent patch-processing sequences after rotation.To address these limitations, we introduce Spectral VMamba, a novel approach that effectively captures the global structure within an image by leveraging spectral information derived from the graph Laplacian of image patches. Through spectral decomposition, our approach encodes patch relationships independently of image orientation, achieving rotation invariance with the aid of our Rotational Feature Normalizer (RFN) module. Our experiments on classification tasks show that Spectral VMamba outperforms the leading SSM models in vision, such as VMamba, while maintaining invariance to rotations and a providing a similar runtime efficiency",

    "abstract": "The emergence and growing popularity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significant potential to enhance various aspects of daily life, from improving communication to facilitating learning and problem-solving. Mobile phones, as essential daily companions, represent the most effective and accessible deployment platform for MLLMs, enabling seamless integration into everyday tasks. However, deploying MLLMs on mobile phones presents challenges due to limitations in memory size and computational capability, making it difficult to achieve smooth and real-time processing without extensive optimization. In this paper, we present BlueLM-V-3B, an algorithm and system co-design approach specifically tailored for the efficient deployment of MLLMs on mobile platforms. To be specific, we redesign the dynamic resolution scheme adopted by mainstream MLLMs and implement system optimization for hardware-aware deployment to optimize model inference on mobile phones. BlueLM-V-3B boasts the following key highlights: (1) Small Size: BlueLM-V-3B features a language model with 2.7B parameters and a vision encoder with 400M parameters. (2) Fast Speed: BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4 token/s on the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor with 4-bit LLM weight quantization. (3) Strong Performance: BlueLM-V-3B has attained the highest average score of 66.1 on the OpenCompass benchmark among models with <= 4B parameters and surpassed a series of models with much larger parameter sizes (e.g., MiniCPM-V-2.6, InternVL2-8B)",

Furthermore, most general-purpose models are designed for healthy subjects and suffer from performance degradation when pathology is present. We introduce UNA (Unraveling Normal Anatomy), the first modality-agnostic learning approach for normal brain anatomy reconstruction that can handle both healthy scans and cases with pathology. We propose a fluid-driven anomaly randomization method that generates an unlimited number of realistic pathology profiles on-the-fly. UNA is trained on a combination of synthetic and real data, and can be applied directly to real images with potential pathology without the need for fine-tuning. We demonstrate UNA's effectiveness in reconstructing healthy brain anatomy and showcase its direct application to anomaly detection, using both simulated and real images from 3D healthy and stroke datasets, including CT and MRI scans. By bridging the gap between healthy and diseased images, UNA enables the use of general-purpose models on diseased images, opening up new opportunities for large-scale analysis of uncurated clinical images in the presence of pathology",

    "abstract": "Image restoration aims to recover content from inputs degraded by various factors, such as adverse weather, blur, and noise. Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have led to significant progress in fast 3D content creation. One common approach is to generate a set of multi-view images of an object, and then reconstruct it into a 3D model. However, this approach bypasses the use of a native 3D representation of the object and is hence prone to geometric artifacts and limited in controllability and manipulation capabilities. An alternative approach involves native 3D generative models that directly produce 3D representations. These models, however, are typically limited in their resolution, resulting in lower quality 3D objects. In this work, we bridge the quality gap between methods that directly generate 3D representations and ones that reconstruct 3D objects from multi-view images. We introduce a multi-view to multi-view diffusion model called Sharp-It, which takes a 3D consistent set of multi-view images rendered from a low-quality object and enriches its geometric details and texture. The diffusion model operates on the multi-view set in parallel, in the sense that it shares features across the generated views. A high-quality 3D model can then be reconstructed from the enriched multi-view set. By leveraging the advantages of both 2D and 3D approaches, our method offers an efficient and controllable method for high-quality 3D content creation. We demonstrate that Sharp-It enables various 3D applications, such as fast synthesis, editing, and controlled generation, while attaining high-quality assets",

    "abstract": "Existing low-light image enhancement (LLIE) and joint LLIE and deblurring (LLIE-deblur) models have made strides in addressing predefined degradations, yet they are often constrained by dynamically coupled degradations. To address these challenges, we introduce a Unified Receptance Weighted Key Value (URWKV) model with multi-state perspective, enabling flexible and effective degradation restoration for low-light images. Specifically, we customize the core URWKV block to perceive and analyze complex degradations by leveraging multiple intra- and inter-stage states. First, inspired by the pupil mechanism in the human visual system, we propose Luminance-adaptive Normalization (LAN) that adjusts normalization parameters based on rich inter-stage states, allowing for adaptive, scene-aware luminance modulation. Second, we aggregate multiple intra-stage states through exponential moving average approach, effectively capturing subtle variations while mitigating information loss inherent in the single-state mechanism. To reduce the degradation effects commonly associated with conventional skip connections, we propose the State-aware Selective Fusion (SSF) module, which dynamically aligns and integrates multi-state features across encoder stages, selectively fusing contextual information. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, our URWKV model achieves superior performance on various benchmarks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computational resources.

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning enhances large vision-language models (LVLMs) but increases their vulnerability to backdoor attacks due to their open design. Unlike prior studies in static settings, this paper explores backdoor attacks in LVLM instruction tuning across mismatched training and testing domains. We introduce a new evaluation dimension, backdoor domain generalization, to assess attack robustness under visual and text domain shifts. Our findings reveal two insights: (1) backdoor generalizability improves when distinctive trigger patterns are independent of specific data domains or model architectures, and (2) the competitive interaction between trigger patterns and clean semantic regions, where guiding the model to predict triggers enhances attack generalizability. Based on these insights, we propose a multimodal attribution backdoor attack (MABA) that injects domain-agnostic triggers into critical areas using attributional interpretation. Experiments with OpenFlamingo, Blip-2, and Otter show that MABA significantly boosts the attack success rate of generalization by 36.4% over the unimodal attack, achieving a 97% success rate at a 0.2% poisoning rate. This study reveals limitations in current evaluations and highlights how enhanced backdoor generalizability poses a security threat to LVLMs, even without test data access",

CFG combines the conditional score (e.g., text-conditioned) with the unconditional score to control the output. However, the unconditional score is in charge of estimating the transition between manifolds of adjacent timesteps from x_t to x_ t-1 , which may inadvertently interfere with the trajectory toward the specific condition. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages a geometric perspective on the unconditional score to enhance CFG performance when conditional scores are available. Specifically, we propose a method that filters the singular vectors of both conditional and unconditional scores using singular value decomposition. This filtering process aligns the unconditional score with the conditional score, thereby refining the sampling trajectory to stay closer to the manifold. Our approach improves image quality with negligible additional computation.

We propose to use a video model to hallucinate intermediate frames between two input images, effectively creating a dense, visual transition, which significantly simplifies the problem of pose estimation. Since current video models can still produce implausible motion or inconsistent geometry, we introduce a self-consistency score that evaluates the consistency of pose predictions from sampled videos. We demonstrate that our approach generalizes among three state-of-the-art video models and show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art DUSt3R baseline on four diverse datasets encompassing indoor, outdoor, and object-centric scenes.

A multi-view visual tokenizer (MV-VT) is employed enabling DriveGPT4-V2 to perceive the environment with an extensive range while maintaining critical details. The model architecture has been refined to improve decision prediction and inference speed. To further enhance the performance, an additional expert LLM is trained for online imitation learning. The expert LLM, sharing a similar structure with DriveGPT4-V2, can access privileged information about surrounding objects for more robust and reliable predictions.

    "abstract": "Recently, learning signed distance functions (SDFs) from point clouds has become popular for reconstruction. To ensure accuracy, most methods require using high-resolution Marching Cubes for surface extraction. However, this results in redundant mesh elements, making the mesh inconvenient to use. To solve the problem, we propose an adaptive meshing method to extract resolution-adaptive meshes based on surface curvature, enabling the recovery of high-fidelity lightweight meshes. Specifically, we first use point-based representation to perceive implicit surfaces and calculate surface curvature. A vertex generator is designed to produce curvature-adaptive vertices with any specified number on the implicit surface, preserving the overall structure and high-curvature features. Then we develop a Delaunay meshing algorithm to generate meshes from vertices, ensuring geometric fidelity and correct topology. In addition, to obtain accurate SDFs for adaptive meshing and achieve better lightweight reconstruction, we design a hybrid representation combining feature grid and feature tri-plane for better detail capture. Experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality lightweight meshes from point clouds. Compared with methods from various categories, our approach achieves superior results, especially in capturing more details with fewer elements",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current structural pruning methods face two significant limitations: (i) they often limit pruning to finer-grained levels like channels, making aggressive parameter reduction challenging, and (ii) they focus heavily on parameter and FLOP reduction, with existing latency-aware methods frequently relying on simplistic, suboptimal linear models that fail to generalize well to transformers, where multiple interacting dimensions impact latency. In this paper, we address both limitations by introducing Multi-Dimensional Pruning(MDP), a novel paradigm that jointly optimizes across a variety of pruning granularities--including channels, query/key, heads, embeddings, and blocks. MDP employs an advanced latency modeling technique to accurately capture latency variations across all prunable dimensions, achieving an optimal balance between latency and accuracy. By reformulating pruning as a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), MDP efficiently identifies the optimal pruned structure across all prunable dimensions while respecting latency constraints. This versatile framework supports both CNNs and transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDP significantly outperforms previous methods, especially at high pruning ratios. On ImageNet, MDP achieves a 28% speed increase with a +1.4 Top-1 accuracy improvement over prior work like HALP for ResNet50 pruning. Against the latest transformer pruning method, Isomorphic, MDP delivers an additional 37% acceleration with a +0.7 Top-1 accuracy improvement",

Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency.

In particular, we concentrate on the resulting singular vectors, which we refer to as Task Singular Vectors (TSV). Recognizing that layer task matrices are often low-rank, we propose TSV-Compress, a simple procedure that compresses them to 10% of their original size while retaining 99% of accuracy. We further leverage this low-rank space to define a new measure of task interference based on the interaction of singular vectors from different tasks.

    "abstract": "Understanding functionalities in 3D scenes involves interpreting natural language descriptions to locate functional interactive objects, such as handles and buttons, in a 3D environment. Functionality understanding is highly challenging, as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example, given a task like \"turn on the ceiling light\", an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch, even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description.To date, no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper, we introduce Fun3DU, the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a VLM. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free, relying entirely on pre-trained models. We evaluate Fun3DU on SceneFun3D, the most recent and only dataset to benchmark this task, which comprises over 3000 task descriptions on 230 scenes.

However, existing approaches have primarily focused on manipulating the shape or movement of objects in 2D plane. We propose to extend this drag-based editing task to 3D space. Firstly, we utilize the trajectory of two points to represent the rotational trajectory of the object. Gaussian maps of a circle and a square are centered at these two points, respectively. We use distinct shapes to ensure that symmetric views produce different object representations. Secondly, we introduce a lightweight mapping network to embed the object features into two Gaussian maps to obtain a continuous control condition that guides the model in learning the correspondence between the trajectory and the object. Finally, to overcome the limitations of current 3D object reconstruction datasets, which typically consist of object maps with transparent backgrounds, we affix random backgrounds to them. This modification helps improve the model's ability to ignore background interference when editing real images with complex backgrounds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves object rotation within the drag framework and demonstrates strong generalization to real-world images",

    "abstract": "Advanced driver assistance systems require a comprehensive understanding of the driver's mental/physical state and traffic context but existing works often neglect the potential benefits of joint learning between these tasks. This paper proposes MMTL-UniAD, a unified multi-modal multi-task learning framework that simultaneously recognizes driver behavior (e.g., looking around, talking), driver emotion (e.g., anxiety, happiness), vehicle behavior (e.g., parking, turning), and traffic context (e.g., traffic jam, traffic smooth). A key challenge is avoiding negative transfer between tasks, which can impair learning performance. To address this, we introduce two key components into the framework: one is the multi-axis region attention network to extract global context-sensitive features, and the other is the dual-branch multimodal embedding to learn multimodal embeddings from both task-shared and task-specific features. The former uses a multi-attention mechanism to extract task-relevant features, mitigating negative transfer caused by task-unrelated features. The latter employs a dual-branch structure to adaptively adjust task-shared and task-specific parameters, enhancing cross-task knowledge transfer while reducing task conflicts. We assess MMTL-UniAD on the AIDE dataset, using a series of ablation studies, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

The effectiveness of the proposed metrics is verified by correlation with human evaluations. We also benchmark various text-to-video generative models and conduct in-depth analysis across different models and various compositional categories.

ESCHER uses a vision-language model (VLM) as a critic to iteratively refine the concept library, including accounting for interactions between concepts and how they affect downstream classifiers. By leveraging the in-context learning abilities of LLMs and the history of performance using various concepts, ESCHER dynamically improves its concept generation strategy based on the VLM critic's feedback. Finally, ESCHER does not require any human annotations, and is thus an automated plug-and-play framework.

Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT creates convex combinations of expert trajectories by selecting a few expert models, guiding student networks to converge quickly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables continuous sampling strategies during the distillation process, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory.

ReferenceNet excels in integrating image reference features, making it highly applicable in creative and commercial settings.

This constraint hinders the provision of appropriate features to the denoising backbone across different timesteps, leading to suboptimal image consistency. In this paper, we revisit the extraction of reference features and propose TFCustom, a model framework designed to focus on reference image features at different temporal steps and frequency levels. Specifically, we firstly propose synchronized ReferenceNet to extract reference image features while simultaneously optimizing noise injection and denoising for the reference image. We also propose a time-aware frequency feature refinement module that leverages high- and low-frequency filters, combined with time embeddings, to adaptively select the degree of reference feature injection.

    "abstract": "Point-supervised Temporal Action Localization poses significant challenges due to the difficulty of identifying complete actions with a single-point annotation per action. Existing methods typically employ Multiple Instance Learning, which struggles to capture global temporal context and requires heuristic post-processing. In research on fully-supervised tasks, DETR-based structures have effectively addressed these limitations. However, it is nontrivial to merely adapt DETR to this task, encountering two major bottlenecks. (1) How to integrate point label information into the model and (2) How to select optimal decoder proposals for training in the absence of complete action segment annotations. To address this issue, we introduce an end-to-end framework by integrating Query Reformation and Optimal Transport (QROT). Specifically, we encode point labels through a set of semantic consensus queries, enabling effective focus on action-relevant snippets. Furthermore, we integrate an optimal transport mechanism to generate high-quality pseudo labels. These pseudo-labels facilitate precise proposals selection based on Hungarian algorithm, significantly enhancing localization accuracy in point-supervised settings. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing MIL-based approaches, offering more stable and accurate temporal action localization in point-level supervision",

Through systematic analysis, we uncover two fundamental limitations: Stable Diffusion (SD) struggles to extract meaningful features from abstract sketches (unlike its success with photos), and exhibits a pronounced frequency-domain bias that suppresses essential low-frequency components needed for sketch understanding. Rather than costly retraining, we address these limitations by strategically combining SD with CLIP, whose strong semantic understanding naturally compensates for SD's spatial-frequency biases. By dynamically injecting CLIP features into SD's denoising process and adaptively aggregating features across semantic levels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch retrieval (+3.35%), recognition (+1.06%), segmentation (+29.42%), and correspondence learning (+21.22%), demonstrating the first truly universal sketch feature representation in the era of foundation models",

    "title": "Bridging the Vision-Brain Gap with an Uncertainty-Aware Blur Prior",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Can our brain signals faithfully reflect the original visual stimuli, even including high-frequency details? Although human perceptual and cognitive capacities enable us to process and remember visual information, these abilities are constrained by several factors, such as limited attentional resources and finite capacity of visual memory. When visual stimuli are processed by human visual system into brain signals, some information is inevitably lost, leading to a discrepancy known as the System GAP. Additionally, perceptual and cognitive dynamics, along with technical noise in signal acquisition, degrade the fidelity of brain signals relative to the visual stimuli, known as the Random GAP. When encoded brain representations are directly aligned with the corresponding pretrained image features, the System GAP and Random GAP between paired data challenge the model, requiring it to bridge these gaps. However, due to limited paired data, these gaps are difficult for the model to learn, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data. To address these GAPs, we propose a simple yet effective approach called the Uncertainty-aware Blur Prior (UBP). It estimates the uncertainty within the paired data, reflecting the mismatch between brain signals and visual stimuli. Based on uncertainty, UBP dynamically blurs the high-frequency details of the original images, reducing the impact of mismatch and improving alignment. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 50.9% and a top-5 accuracy of 79.7% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.

We first find that existing imperceptible triggers designed for supervised learning are less effective in compromising self-supervised models. We then identify this ineffectiveness is attributed to the overlap in distributions between the backdoor and augmented samples used in SSL. Building on this insight, we design an attack using optimized triggers disentangled with the augmented transformation in the SSL, while remaining imperceptible to human vision.

However, existing models still struggle to capture the perceptual alignment between varying speech characteristics and corresponding lip movements. In this work, we claim that three criteria--Temporal Synchronization, Lip Readability, and Expressiveness--are crucial for achieving perceptually accurate lip movements. Motivated by our hypothesis that a desirable representation space exists to meet these three criteria, we introduce a speech-mesh synchronized representation that captures intricate correspondences between speech signals and 3D face meshes. We found that our learned representation exhibits desirable characteristics, and we plug it into existing models as a perceptual loss to better align lip movements to the given speech. In addition, we utilize this representation as a perceptual metric and introduce two other physically grounded lip synchronization metrics to assess how well the generated 3D talking heads align with these three criteria. Experiments show that training 3D talking head generation models with our perceptual loss significantly improve all three aspects of perceptually accurate lip synchronization.

The problem is solved in a ground-up manner here by detecting the building corners in 2D, lifting and connecting them in 3D space afterwards with additional data augmentation.Due to the 2.5D characteristic of the airborne LiDAR point cloud, we simplify the problem by projecting the points on the ground plane to produce a 2D height map. With the height map, a heat map is first generated with pixel-wise corner likelihood to predict the possible 2D corners.Then, 3D corners are predicted by a Transformer-based network with extra height embedding initialization. This 2D-to-3D corner detection strategy reduces the search space significantly. To recover the topological connections among the corners, edges are finally predicted from the height map with the proposed edge attention mechanism, which extracts holistic features and preserves local details simultaneously. In addition, due to the limited datasets in the field and the irregularity of the point clouds, a conditional latent diffusion model for LiDAR scanning simulation is utilized for data augmentation. BWFormer surpasses other state-of-the-art methods, especially in reconstruction completeness. Our code is available at: https://github.com/3dv-casia/BWformer/",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based policies have shown impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks while struggling with out-of-domain distributions. Recent efforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature encoding for diffusion policy. However, their generalization is typically limited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that leveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define \"where\" and \"how\" an agent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to entirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion Policy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP), designed for generalizable manipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D contact points and post-contact trajectories, capturing the essential static and dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from in-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation matrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration techniques. More importantly, we incorporate affordance guidance during diffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance directs the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation for unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of action space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous diffusion-based methods, successfully generalizing to unseen instances and categories where others fail",

    "abstract": "Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) shows promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference, an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale, conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolutions) scales. However, this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the resolution sampling schedule.We introduce \\underline H ierarchical \\underline M asked \\underline A uto\\underline R egressive modeling (HMAR), a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process, wherein prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale, HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256 x 256 and 512 x 512 benchmarks, HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR, diffusion, and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5xand 1.75 xrespectively, as well as over 3 xlower inference memory footprint. Finally, the Markovian formulation of HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; we show that its sampling schedule can be changed without further training, and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner",

    "abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to match the same person using sequentially collected data. However, due to the long-term nature of lifelong learning, the inevitable changes in human clothes prevent the model from relying on unified discriminative information (e.g., clothing style) to match the same person in the streaming data, demanding differentiated cloth-irrelevant information. Unfortunately, existing LReID methods typically fail to leverage such knowledge resulting in the exacerbation of catastrophic forgetting issues. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a challenging practical task called Cloth-Hybrid Lifelong Person Re-identification (CH-LReID), which requires matching the same person wearing different clothes using sequentially collected data. A Differentiated Knowledge Consolidation (DKC) framework is designed to unify and balance distinct knowledge across streaming data. The core idea is to adaptively balance differentiated knowledge and compatibly consolidate cloth-relevant and cloth-irrelevant information. To this end, a Differentiated Knowledge Transfer (DKT) module and a Latent Knowledge Consolidation (LKC) module are designed to adaptively discover differentiated new knowledge, while eliminating the derived domain shift of old knowledge via reconstructing the old latent feature space, respectively. Then, to further alleviate the catastrophic conflict between differentiated new and old knowledge, we further propose a Dual-level Distribution Alignment (DDA) module to align the distribution of discriminative knowledge at both the instance level and the fine-grained level.

Hence, protecting facial privacy against unauthorized AFR systems is essential. Inspired by the generation capability of the emerging diffusion models, recent methods employ diffusion models to generate adversarial face images for privacy protection. However, they suffer from the diffusion purification effect, leading to a low protection success rate (PSR). In this paper, we first propose learning unconditional embeddings to increase the learning capacity for adversarial modifications and then use them to guide the modification of the adversarial latent code to weaken the diffusion purification effect. Moreover, we integrate an identity-preserving structure to maintain structural consistency between the original and generated images, allowing human observers to recognize the generated image as having the same identity as the original. Extensive experiments conducted on two public datasets, i.e., CelebA-HQ and LADN, demonstrate the superiority of our approach.

However, current methods often struggle to achieve high-quality renderings across all head components (e.g., skin vs. hair) due to the limitations of using one single representation for elements with varying characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we employ an enhanced FLAME mesh for the facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic rendering, we use deferred neural rendering to obtain facial colors and decompose neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports diverse downstream tasks.

However, while individual samples may appear unique, generative models often exhibit limitations in covering the full data distribution. Unlike quality issues, diversity problems within generative models are not easily detected by simply observing single images or generated datasets, which means we need a specific measure to assess the diversity of these models. In this paper, we draw attention to the current lack of diversity in generative models and the inability of common metrics to measure this. We achieve this by framing diversity as an image retrieval problem, where we measure how many real images can be retrieved using synthetic data as queries. This yields the Image Retrieval Score (IRS), an interpretable, hyperparameter-free metric that quantifies the diversity of a generative model's output. IRS requires only a subset of synthetic samples and provides a statistical measure of confidence. Our experiments indicate that current feature extractors commonly used in generative model assessment are inadequate for evaluating diversity effectively. Consequently, we perform an extensive search for the best feature extractors to assess diversity. Evaluation reveals that current diffusion models converge to limited subsets of the real distribution, with no current state-of-the-art models superpassing 77% of the diversity of the training data. To address this limitation, we introduce Diversity-Aware Diffusion Models (DiADM), a novel approach that improves diversity of unconditional diffusion models without loss of image quality. We do this by disentangling diversity from image quality by using a diversity aware module that uses pseudo-unconditional features as input. We provide a Python package offering unified feature extraction and metric computation to further facilitate the evaluation of generative models https://github.com/MischaD/beyondfid",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of deep learning-based methods in medical image segmentation, their use in clinical practice remains limited for two main reasons. First, obtaining a large medical dataset with precise annotations to train segmentation models is challenging. Secondly, most current segmentation techniques generate a single deterministic segmentation mask for each image. However, in real-world scenarios, there is often significant uncertainty regarding what defines the \"correct\" segmentation, and various expert annotators might provide different segmentations for the same image. To tackle both of these problems, we propose Annotation Ambiguity Aware Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation (AmbiSSL). AmbiSSL combines a small amount of multi-annotator labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data to generate diverse and plausible segmentation maps. Our method consists of three key components: (1) The Diverse Pseudo-Label Generation (DPG) module utilizes multiple decoders, created by performing randomized pruning on the original backbone decoder. These pruned decoders enable the generation of a diverse pseudo-label set; (2) a Semi-Supervised Latent Distribution Learning (SSLDL) module constructs a common latent space by utilizing both ground truth annotations and pseudo-label set; and (3) a Cross-Decoder Supervision (CDS) module, which enables pruned decoders to guide each other's learning. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly available datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AmbiSSL can generate diverse segmentation maps using only a small amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data, offering a more practical solution for medical image segmentation by reducing reliance on large labeled datasets",

    "abstract": "Cloud removal (CR) remains a challenging task in remote sensing image processing. Although diffusion models (DM) exhibit strong generative capabilities, their direct applications to CR are suboptimal, as they generate cloudless images from random noise, ignoring inherent information in cloudy inputs. To overcome this drawback, we develop a new CR model EMRDM based on mean-reverting diffusion models (MRDMs) to establish a direct diffusion process between cloudy and cloudless images. Compared to current MRDMs, EMRDM offers a modular framework with updatable modules and an elucidated design space, based on a reformulated forward process and a new ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based backward process. Leveraging our framework, we redesign key MRDM modules to boost CR performance, including restructuring the denoiser via a preconditioning technique, reorganizing the training process, and improving the sampling process by introducing deterministic and stochastic samplers. To achieve multi-temporal CR, we further develop a denoising network for simultaneously denoising sequential images. Experiments on mono-temporal and multi-temporal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of EMRDM. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ly403/EMRDM",

Depending on the application, avatar reconstruction involves different capture setups and constraints -- for example, visual effects studios use camera arrays to capture hundreds of reference images, while content creators may seek to animate a single portrait image downloaded from the internet. As such, there is a large and heterogeneous ecosystem of methods for avatar reconstruction. Techniques based on multi-view stereo or neural rendering achieve the highest quality results, but require hundreds of reference images. Recent generative models produce convincing avatars from a single reference image, but visual fidelity lags behind multi-view techniques. Here, we present CAP4D: an approach that uses a morphable multi-view diffusion model to reconstruct photoreal 4D (dynamic 3D) portrait avatars from any number of reference images (i.e., one to 100) and animate and render them in real time.

Existing methods grounded on the information bottleneck principle compute information in a specific layer to obtain attributions, compressing the features by injecting noise via a parametric damping ratio. However, the attribution obtained in a specific layer neglects evidence of the decision-making process distributed across layers. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA), which discovers the relevant information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper bounding layer-wise information.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Optical imaging capable of resolving nanoscale features would revolutionize scientific research and engineering applications across biomedicine, smart manufacturing, and semiconductor quality control. However, due to the physical phenomenon of diffraction, the optical resolution is limited to approximately half the wavelength of light, which impedes the observation of subwavelength objects such as the native state coronavirus, typically smaller than 200 nm. Fortunately, deep learning methods have shown remarkable potential in uncovering underlying patterns within data, promising to overcome the diffraction limit by revealing the mapping pattern between diffraction images and their corresponding ground truth object images. However, the absence of suitable datasets has hindered progress in this field--collecting high-quality optical data of subwavelength objects is highly difficult as these objects are inherently invisible under conventional microscopy, making it impossible to perform standard visual calibration and drift correction. Therefore, we provide the first general optical imaging dataset based on the \"building block\" concept for challenging the diffraction limit. Drawing an analogy to modular construction principles, we construct a comprehensive optical imaging dataset comprising subwavelength fundamental elements, i.e., small square units that can be assembled into larger and more complex objects. We then frame the task as an image-to-image translation task and evaluate various vision methods. Experimental results validate our \"building block\" concept, demonstrating that models trained on basic square units can effectively generalize to realistic, more complex unseen objects. Most importantly, by highlighting this underexplored AI-for-science area and its potential, we aspire to advance optical science by fostering collaboration with the vision and machine learning communities",

    "abstract": "Dataset distillation has emerged as a powerful approach for reducing data requirements in deep learning. Among various methods, distribution matching-based approaches stand out for their balance of computational efficiency and strong performance. However, existing distance metrics used in distribution matching often fail to accurately capture distributional differences, leading to unreliable measures of discrepancy. In this paper, we reformulate dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD), a comprehensive and theoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD leverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional information, employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for the CF's frequency arguments, thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance distance estimation. Simultaneously, we minimize the difference between real and synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure. Our approach, termed Neural Characteristic Function Matching (NCFM), inherently aligns the phase and amplitude of neural features in the complex plane for both real and synthetic data, achieving a balance between realism and diversity in synthetic samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on both low- and high-resolution datasets. Notably, we achieve a 22.9% accuracy boost on ImageSquawk. Our method also reduces GPU memory usage by over 300x and achieves 20x faster processing speeds compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging the generative capacity of diffusion model, existing approaches are able to generate high-fidelity poses, but struggle with significant viewpoint changes, especially in zoom-in/zoom-out scenarios where camera-character distance varies. This limits the applications such as cinematic shot type plan or camera control. We propose a pose-correlated reference selection diffusion network, supporting substantial viewpoint variations in human animation. Our key idea is to enable the network to utilize multiple reference images as input, since significant viewpoint changes often lead to missing appearance details on the human body. To eliminate the computational cost, we first introduce a novel pose correlation module to compute similarities between non-aligned target and source poses, and then propose an adaptive reference selection strategy, utilizing the attention map to identify key regions for animation generation. To train our model, we curated a large dataset from public TED talks featuring varied shots of the same character, helping the model learn synthesis for different perspectives. Our experimental results show that with the same number of reference images, our model performs favorably compared to the current SOTA methods under large viewpoint change. We further show that the adaptive reference selection is able to choose the most relevant reference regions to generate humans under free viewpoints",

Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead, making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However, existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE), which severely limits their performance and quantization potential. To address above issue, we first unveil the importance of different input information during PFE and identify the height dimension as a key factor in enhancing 3D detection performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose a height-aware pillar feature encoder, called PillarHist. Specifically, PillarHist statistics the discrete distribution of points at different heights within one pillar. This simple yet effective design greatly preserves the information along the height dimension while significantly reducing the computation overhead of the PFE. Meanwhile, PillarHist also constrains the arithmetic distribution of PFE input to a stable range, making it quantization-friendly. Notably, PillarHist operates exclusively within the PFE stage to enhance performance, enabling seamless integration into existing pillar-based methods without introducing complex operations. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of PillarHist in terms of both efficiency and performance",

Evidence from cross-cultural psychology suggests that this approach will bias models against perceptual modes exhibited by people who speak other (non-English) languages. We investigate semantic and expressive variation in image captions across different languages; we analyze both human-annotated datasets and model-produced captions. By analyzing captions across seven languages (English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean) in high-quality image captioning datasets (Crossmodal and Visual Genome), we find that multilingual caption sets tend to provide richer visual descriptions than monolingual (including English-only) ones; multilingual sets contain 46.0% more objects, 66.1% more relationships, and 66.8% more attributes. We observe the same results with multilingual captions produced by LLaVA and the Google Vertex API: for example, compared to monolingual captions, they cover 21.9% more objects,18.8% more relations, and 20.1% more attributes. These suggest that, across a large number of samples, different languages bias people and models to focus on different visual concepts. Finally, we show that models trained on image-text data in one language perform distinctly better on that language's test set.

However, the computational cost of processing long visual tokens can be prohibitively expensive on resource-limited devices. Previous methods have identified redundancy in visual tokens within the Large Language Model (LLM) decoder layers and have mitigated this by pruning tokens using a pre-defined or fixed ratio, thereby reducing computational overhead. Nonetheless, we observe that the impact of pruning ratio varies across different LLM layers and instances (image-prompt pairs). Therefore, it is essential to develop a layer-wise and instance-wise vision token pruning strategy to balance computational cost and model performance effectively. We propose ATP-LLaVA, a novel approach that adaptively determines instance-specific token pruning ratios for each LLM layer. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP) module, which computes the importance score and pruning threshold based on input instance adaptively. The ATP module can be seamlessly integrated between any two LLM layers with negligible computational overhead. Additionally, we develop a Spatial Augmented Pruning (SAP) strategy that prunes visual tokens with both token redundancy and spatial modeling perspectives.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to recognize individuals under different clothing scenarios. Current CC-ReID approaches either concentrate on modeling body shape using additional modalities including silhouette, pose, and body mesh, potentially causing the model to overlook other critical biometric traits such as gender, age, and style, or they incorporate supervision through additional labels that the model tries to disregard or emphasize, such as clothing or personal attributes. However, these annotations are discrete in nature and do not capture comprehensive descriptions. In this work, we propose DIFFER: Disentangle Identity Features From Entangled Representations, a novel adversarial learning method that leverages textual descriptions to disentangle identity features. Recognizing that image features inherently mix inseparable information, DIFFER introduces NBDetach, a mechanism designed for feature disentanglement by leveraging the separable nature of text descriptions as supervision. It partitions the feature space into distinct subspaces and, through gradient reversal layers, effectively separates identity-related features from non-biometric features. We evaluate DIFFER on 4 different benchmark datasets (LTCC, PRCC, CelebreID-Light, and CCVID) to demonstrate its effectiveness and provide state-of-the-art performance across all the benchmarks. DIFFER consistently outperforms the baseline method, with improvements in top-1 accuracy of 3.6% on LTCC, 3.4% on PRCC, 2.5% on CelebReID-Light, and 1% on CCVID.

The inherent appearance variations in natural scenes, attributable to environmental conditions, perspective, and lighting, induce a significant domain disparity between the training and test datasets. This disparity degrades the precision of contemporary localization networks. To mitigate this, we advocate for incorporating hypernetworks into single-scene and multiscene camera pose regression models. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically computes adaptive weights for the localization regression heads based on the particular input image, effectively narrowing the domain gap. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we evaluate the HyperPose methodology across multiple established absolute pose regression architectures. In particular, we introduce and share the Extended Cambridge Landmarks (ECL), which is a novel localization dataset, based on the Cambridge Landmarks dataset, showing it in multiple seasons with significantly varying appearance conditions. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that HyperPose yields notable performance enhancements for both single- and multi-scene architectures.

    "title": "Critic-V: VLM Critics Help Catch VLM Errors in Multimodal Reasoning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However, they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges, we introduce Critic-V, a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner, which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs, and the Critic, which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach, the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts, which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards, enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward (RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods, including GPT-4V, on 5 out of 8 benchmarks, especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process. Our approach provides a promising solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs, improving their performance in real-world reasoning-heavy multimodal applications such as autonomous driving and embodied intelligence",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is emerging as a promising paradigm to bridge the human-machine performance gap. For single objects, VLT broadens the problem scope to text-driven video comprehension. Yet, this direction is still confined to 2D spatial extents, currently lacking the ability to deal with 3D tracking in the confines of monocular video. Unfortunately, advances in 3D tracking mainly rely on expensive sensor inputs, e.g., point clouds, depth measurements, radar. Absence of language counterpart for the outputs of these mildly democratized sensors in the literature also hinders VLT expansion to 3D tracking. Addressing that, we make the first attempt towards extending VLT to 3D tracking based on monocular video. We present a comprehensive framework, introducing (i) the Monocular-Video-based 3D Visual Language Tracking (Mono3DVLT) task, (ii) a large-scale dataset for the task, called Mono3DVLT-V2X, and (iii) a customized neural model for the task. Our dataset is carefully curated, leveraging a Large Langauge Model (LLM) followed by human verification, composing natural language descriptions for 79,158 video sequences aiming at single object tracking, providing 2D and 3D bounding box annotations. Our neural model, termed Mono3DVLT-MT, is the first targeted approach for the Mono3DVLT task. Comprising the pipeline of multi-modal feature extractor, visual-language encoder, tracking decoder and a tracking head, our model sets a strong baseline for the task on Mono3DVLT-V2X.

However, recent research has primarily focused on image classification tasks, with limited expansion to detection and segmentation. Two key challenges remain: (i) Task Optimization Heterogeneity, where existing methods focus on class-level information and fail to address the diverse needs of detection and segmentation and (ii) Inflexible Image Generation, where current generation methods rely on global updates for single-class targets and lack localized optimization for specific object regions.To address these challenges, we propose a universal dataset distillation framework, named UniDD, a task-driven diffusion model for diverse DD tasks, as illustrated in Fig.1. Our approach operates in two stages: Universal Task Knowledge Mining, which captures task-relevant information through task-specific proxy model training, and Universal Task-Driven Diffusion, where these proxies guide the diffusion process to generate task-specific synthetic images.Extensive experiments across ImageNet-1K, Pascal VOC, and MS COCO demonstrate that UniDD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In particular, on ImageNet-1K with IPC-10, UniDD surpasses previous diffusion-based methods by 6.1%, while also reducing deployment costs",

These approaches do not clarify why such methods work and often fail when a heuristic suitable for one task is blindly applied to others. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework for analyzing why diffusion synchronization works and reveal where heuristics should be focused--modeling correlations between multiple trajectories and adapting them to each specific task.

Addressing these challenges, we introduce MaRI, a framework designed to bridge the feature space gap between synthetic and real-world materials. MaRI constructs a shared embedding space that harmonizes visual and material attributes through a contrastive learning strategy by jointly training a image and a material encoder, bringing similar materials and images closer while separating dissimilar pairs within the feature space. To support this, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising high-quality synthetic materials rendered with controlled shape variations and diverse lighting conditions, along with real-world materials processed and standardized using material transfer techniques.

Most existing methods leverage text as a guide to achieve pixel-level recognition. However, the inherent biases in text semantic descriptions and the lack of pixel-level supervisory information make it challenging to fine-tune CLIP-based models effectively. This paper considers leveraging image-text data to simultaneously capture the semantic information contained in both image and text, thereby constructing Dual Semantic Guidance and corresponding pixel-level pseudo annotations. Particularly, the visual semantic guidance is enhanced via explicitly exploring foreground regions and minimizing the influence of background. The dual semantic guidance is then jointly utilized to fine-tune CLIP-based segmentation models, achieving decent fine-grained recognition capabilities.

We propose a data-efficient generalizable localization method named GenLoc. GenLoc extracts the generative priors from a pre-trained image generation model by calculating the correlation map between image latent feature and condition embedding. Those priors are hence optimized with our proposed heatmap expectation loss to perform object keypoint localization. Benefited by the rich knowledge of generative priors in understanding of object semantics and structures, GenLoc achieves superior performance on various object keypoint localization benchmarks.

Existing methods typically rely on an explicit Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process of text spotting or localization, which is susceptible to complex pipelines and accumulated errors. To settle this, we resort to the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models, which have demonstrated the capacity to perceive and understand scene text, making it possible to achieve strictly OCR-free STR. From the perspective of parameter-efficient transfer learning, a lightweight visual position adapter is proposed to provide a positional information complement for the visual encoder. Besides, we introduce a visual context dropout technique to improve the alignment of local visual features. A novel, parameter-free cross-attention mechanism transfers the contrastive relationship between images and text to that between visual tokens and text, producing a rich cross-modal representation, which can be utilized for efficient reranking with a linear classifier. The resulting model, CAYN, which proves that CLIP is Almost all You Need for STR with no more than 0.50M additional parameters required, achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the STR task, with 92.46%/89.49%/85.98% mAP on the SVT/IIIT-STR/TTR datasets.

    "abstract": "Training-free Neural Architecture Search (NAS) efficiently identifies high-performing neural networks using zero-cost (ZC) proxies. Unlike multi-shot and one-shot NAS approaches, ZC-NAS is both (i) time-efficient, eliminating the need for model training, and (ii) interpretable, with proxy designs often theoretically grounded. Despite rapid developments in the field, current SOTA ZC proxies are typically constrained to well-established convolutional search spaces. With the rise of Large Language Models shaping the future of deep learning, this work extends ZC proxy applicability to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We present a new benchmark using the Autoformer search space evaluated on 6 distinct tasks, and propose Layer-Sample Wise Activation with Gradients information (L-SWAG), a novel, generalizable metric that characterises both convolutional and transformer architectures across 14 tasks. Additionally, previous works highlighted how different proxies contain complementary information, motivating the need for a ML model to identify useful combinations. To further enhance ZC-NAS, we therefore introduce LIBRA-NAS (Low Information gain and Bias Re-Alignment), a method that strategically combines proxies to best represent a specific benchmark. Integrated into the NAS search, LIBRA-NAS outperforms evolution and gradient-based NAS techniques by identifying an architecture with a 17.0% test error on ImageNet1k in just 0.1 GPU days",

Our method explicitly grounds VQA tasks to video fragments in four steps: entailment tree construction, video-language entailment verification, tree reasoning, and dynamic tree expansion. A vital benefit of the method is its generalizability to current video- and image-based VLMs across reasoning types.To support fair evaluation, we devise a de-biasing procedure based on large-language models that rewrite VQA benchmark answer sets to enforce model reasoning.

One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However, in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be possible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of supplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: \"what makes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?\" Many would assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only option? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation datasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic imagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these alternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what makes a good dataset for distillation.

This task poses challenges in lifelong scenarios where edits must be continuously applied for real-world applications.

In this paper, we propose LiveEdit, a lifelong vision language model edit to bridge the gap between lifelong LLM editing and VLLMs. We begin by training an editing expert generator to independently produce low-rank experts for each editing instance, with the goal of correcting the relevant responses of the VLLM. A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge, thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally, to integrate visually relevant experts, we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation, we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios.

    "abstract": "Online stereo rectification is critical for autonomous vehicles and robots in dynamic environments, where factors such as vibration, temperature fluctuations, and mechanical stress can affect rectification accuracy and severely degrade downstream stereo depth estimation. Current dominant approaches for online stereo rectification involve estimating relative camera poses in real time to derive rectification homographies. However, they do not directly optimize for rectification constraints. Additionally, the general-purpose correspondence matchers used in these methods are not trained for rectification, while training of these matchers typically requires ground-truth correspondences which are not available in stereo rectification datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a matching-based stereo rectification framework that is directly optimized for rectification and does not require ground-truth correspondence annotations for training. We assume intrinsics are known as they are generally available on modern devices and are relatively stable. Our framework incorporates a rectification-constrained estimator and applies multi-level, rectification-specific supervision that trains the matcher network for rectification without relying on ground-truth correspondences. Additionally, we create a new rectification dataset with ground-truth optical flow annotations, eliminating bias from evaluation metrics used in prior work that relied on pretrained keypoint matching or optical flow models. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms both state-of-the-art matching-based and matching-free methods in vertical flow metric by 10.7% on the Carla-Flowguided dataset and 21.3% on the Semi-Truck Highway dataset, offering superior rectification accuracy",

To bridge this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach for generating, from text, images, or unstructured 3D objects, 3D objects composed of meaningful parts. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion model to extract plausible and view-consistent part segmentations from multiple views of a 3D object, dividing it into meaningful components. A second multi-view diffusion model then processes each part individually, filling in occlusions and generating completed views, which are subsequently passed to a 3D reconstruction network. The completion process ensures that the reconstructed parts integrate cohesively by considering the context of the entire object, compensating for missing information caused by occlusions and, in extreme cases, hallucinating entirely invisible parts based on contextual cues. We evaluate PartGen on both generated and real 3D assets, demonstrating significant improvements over segmentation and part completion baselines.

    "abstract": "Server aggregation conflict is a key challenge in personalized federated learning (PFL). While existing PFL methods have achieved significant progress with shallow base models (e.g., four-layer CNNs), they often overlook the negative impacts of deeper base models on personalization mechanisms. In this paper, we identify the phenomenon of deep model degradation in PFL, where as base model depth increases, the model becomes more sensitive to local client data distributions, thereby exacerbating server aggregation conflicts and ultimately reducing overall model performance. Moreover, we show that these conflicts manifest in insufficient global average updates and mutual constraints between clients. Motivated by our analysis, we proposed a two-stage conflict-aware layer-wise mitigation algorithm (FedCALM), which first constructs a conflict-free global update to alleviate negative conflicts, and then maximizes the benefits of all clients through a conflict-aware strategy. Notably, our method naturally leads to a selective mechanism that balances the tradeoff between clients involved in aggregation and the tolerance for conflicts. Consequently, it can boost the positive contribution to the clients even with the greatest conflicts with the global update. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and deeper base models demonstrate that FedCALM outperforms four state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by up to 9.88% and seamlessly integrates into existing PFL methods with performance improvements of up to 9.01%",

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are increasingly recognized as a versatile data modality for representing discretized signals, offering benefits such as infinite query resolution and reduced storage requirements. Existing signal compression approaches for INRs typically employ one of two strategies: 1. direct quantization with entropy coding of the trained INR; 2. deriving a latent code on top of the INR through a learnable transformation. Thus, their performance is heavily dependent on the quantization and entropy coding schemes employed. In this paper, we introduce SINR, an innovative compression algorithm that leverages the patterns in the vector spaces formed by weights of INRs. We compress these vector spaces using a high-dimensional sparse code within a dictionary. Further analysis reveals that the atoms of the dictionary used to generate the sparse code do not need to be learned or transmitted to successfully recover the INR weights. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can be integrated with any existing INR-based signal compression technique. Our results indicate that SINR achieves substantial reductions in storage requirements for INRs across various configurations, outperforming conventional INR-based compression baselines. Furthermore, SINR maintains high-quality decoding across diverse data modalities, including images, occupancy fields, and Neural Radiance Fields",

Prior approaches either require large-scale caricature and photo data or lack intuitive mechanisms for users to guide the deformation without losing identity. We address the data scarcity by synthesising training data through Thin Plate Spline (TPS) deformation of standard face images. For creative control, we design a Bezier curve interface where users can easily manipulate facial features, with these edits then driving TPS transformations at inference time. When combined with a pre-trained ID-preserving diffusion model, our system maintains both identity preservation and creative flexibility.

(2) Spatiotemporal models often lean heavily on one type of artifact and ignore the other: how can we ensure balanced learning from both? (3) Videos are naturally resource-intensive: how can we tackle efficiency without compromising accuracy? This paper attempts to tackle the three challenges jointly. First, inspired by the notable generality of using image-level blending data for image forgery detection, we investigate whether and how video-level blending can be effective in video. We then perform a thorough analysis and identify a previously underexplored temporal forgery artifact: Facial Feature Drift (FFD), which commonly exists across different forgeries. To reproduce FFD, we then propose a novel Video-level Blending data (VB), where VB is implemented by blending the original image and its warped version frame-by-frame, serving as a hard negative sample to mine more general artifacts. Second, we carefully design a lightweight Spatiotemporal Adapter (StA) to equip a pre-trained image model with the ability to capture both spatial and temporal features jointly and efficiently. StA is designed with two-stream 3D-Conv with varying kernel sizes, allowing it to process spatial and temporal features separately. This eliminates the need to design a new deepfake-specific video architecture from scratch.

The twofold demand of concept erasure requires a precise removal of the target concept during generation (i.e., erasure efficacy), while a minimal impact on non-target content generation (i.e., prior preservation). Existing methods are either computationally costly or face challenges in maintaining an effective balance between erasure efficacy and prior preservation. To improve, we propose a precise, fast, and low-cost concept erasure method, called Adaptive Vaule Decomposer (AdaVD), which is training-free. This method is grounded in a classical linear algebraic orthogonal complement operation, implemented in the value space of each cross-attention layer within the UNet of diffusion models. An effective shift factor is designed to adaptively navigate the erasure strength, enhancing prior preservation without sacrificing erasure efficacy. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed AdaVD is effective at both single and multiple concept erasure, showing a 2- to 10-fold improvement in prior preservation as compared to the second best, meanwhile achieving the best or near best erasure efficacy, when comparing with both training-based and training-free state of the arts.

However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 15 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing",

In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages two separate pretrained diffusion models and makes vision and audio influence each other during generation based on the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. First, the individual video and audio pretrained generation models are decomposed into input, output, and expert sub-modules.

Then, we introduce a joint classifier-free guidance technique to boost the performance during joint generation. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets, and in both objective and subjective evaluation our method surpass all the baseline methods in almost all metrics.

This paper proposes the task of virtual try-on for ornaments and presents a method to improve the geometric and appearance preservation of ornament virtual try-ons. Specifically, we estimate an accurate wearing mask to improve the alignments between ornaments and models in an iterative scheme alongside the denoising process. To preserve structure details, we further regularize attention layers to map the reference ornament mask to the wearing mask in an implicit way. Experiment results demonstrate that our method successfully wears ornaments from reference images onto target models, handling substantial differences in scale and pose while preserving identity and achieving realistic visual effects",

However, the high computational overhead of segmentation limits its application on resource-constrained AR/VR devices, causing large processing latency and degrading user experience. In contrast to conventional scenarios, AR/VR users typically focus on only a few regions within their field of view before shifting perspective, allowing segmentation to be concentrated on gaze-specific areas. This insight drives the need for efficient segmentation methods that prioritize processing instance of interest, reducing computational load and enhancing real-time performance. In this paper, we present a foveated instance segmentation(FovealSeg) framework that leverages real-time user gaze data to perform instance segmentation exclusively on instance of interest, resulting in substantial computational savings. Evaluation results show that FSNet achieves an IoU of 0.56 on ADE20K and 0.54 on LVIS, notably outperforming the baseline.

    "abstract": "Despite the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models, controlling the number of depicted objects using text is surprisingly hard. This is important for various applications from technical documents, to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach, CountGen, does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled synthetic data (source) to unlabeled real-world data (target). Traditional UDA-SS methods work on the assumption that the category settings between the source and target domains are known in advance. However, in real-world scenarios, the category settings of the source and target are unknown due to the lack of labels in the target, resulting in the existence of target-private or source-private classes. Traditional UDA-SS methods struggle with this change, leading to negative transfer and performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS) for the first time to achieve good performance even when the category settings of source and target are unknown. We defined the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as that the confidence score of common Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However, traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private private classes exist. To address this limitation, we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS), achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain, which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem, we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Ma tching and Prototype-based Distinction, a novel framework composed of two key components. First, Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes, enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second, Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/UniDA-SS",

In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals produced by lower trajectory-matching losses, as they contain common patterns. Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets. Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD. Our code and benchmark have been made public at NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/EDF",

    "abstract": "Interpretability and consistency have long been crucial factors in MRI reconstruction. While interpretability has been significantly innovated with the emerging deep unfolding networks, current solutions still suffer from inconsistency issues and produce inferior anatomical structures. Especially in out-of-distribution cases, e.g., when the acceleration rate (AR) varies, the generalization performance is often catastrophic. To counteract the dilemma, we propose an innovative Linear Mamba Operator (LMO) to ensure consistency and generalization, while still enjoying desirable interpretability. Theoretically, we argue that mapping between function spaces, rather than between signal instances, provides a solid foundation of high generalization. Technically, LMO achieves a good balance between global integration facilitated by a state space model that scans the whole function domain, and local integration engaged with an appealing property of continuous-discrete equivalence. On that basis, learning holistic features can be guaranteed, tapping the potential of maximizing data consistency. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that LMO significantly outperforms other state-of-the-arts. More importantly, LMO is the unique model that, with AR changed, achieves retraining performance without retraining steps. Codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengJianwei2/LMO",

Previous methods directly cluster anomalies but often struggle due to the lack of anomaly-prior knowledge. Acquiring this knowledge faces two issues: the non-prominent and weak-semantics anomalies. In this paper, we propose AnomalyNCD, a multi-class anomaly classification network compatible with different anomaly detection methods. To address the non-prominence of anomalies, we design main element binarization (MEBin) to obtain anomaly-centered images, ensuring anomalies are learned while avoiding the impact of incorrect detections. Next, to learn anomalies with weak semantics, we design mask-guided representation learning, which focuses on isolated anomalies guided by masks and reduces confusion from erroneous inputs through corrected pseudo labels. Finally, to enable flexible classification at both region and image levels, we develop a region merging strategy that determines the overall image category based on the classified anomaly regions.

This approach yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of interest, a potentially useful inductive bias.

This misalignment, combined with the limited availability of one-class samples and the restricted diversity of task-specific adaptation, can significantly exacerbate the adverse effects of gradient instability and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Task-Specific Gradient Adaptation (TSGA) for FS-OCC. Without extra supervision, TSGA learns to generate appropriate, stable gradients by leveraging label prediction and feature representation details of one-class samples and refines the adaptation process by recalibrating task-specific gradients and regularization terms.

Recently, the strong multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven substantial improvements in visual grounding, though they inevitably require fine-tuning and additional model components to explicitly generate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. However, we discover that a few attention heads in frozen LVLMs demonstrate strong visual grounding capabilities. We refer to these heads, which consistently capture object locations related to text semantics, as localization heads. Using localization heads, we introduce a straightforward and effective training-free visual grounding framework that utilizes text-to-image attention maps from localization heads to identify the target objects. Surprisingly, only three out of thousands of attention heads are sufficient to achieve competitive localization performance compared to existing LVLM-based visual grounding methods that require fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that LVLMs can innately ground objects based on a deep comprehension of the text-image relationship, as they implicitly focus on relevant image regions to generate informative text outputs",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Track-Focused Online Multi-Object Tracker (TrackTrack) with two key strategies: Track-Perspective-Based Association (TPA) and Track-Aware Initialization (TAI). The TPA strategy associates each track with the most suitable detection result by choosing the one with the minimum distance from all available detection results in a track-perspective manner. On the other hand, TAI precludes the generation of spurious tracks in the track-aware aspect by suppressing track initialization of detection results that heavily overlap with current active tracks and more confident detection results. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that our TrackTrack outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers, offering improved robustness and accuracy across diverse and challenging tracking scenarios",

Two types of approaches to the problem have evolved: 1) Supervised and 2) optimization-based methods. Supervised methods are fast during inference and achieve high-quality results, however, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled training data and are susceptible to domain gaps. In contrast, unsupervised test-time optimization methods do not face the problem of domain gaps but usually suffer from substantial runtime, exhibit artifacts, or fail to converge to the right solution. In this work, we mitigate several limitations of existing optimization-based methods. To this end, we 1) introduce a simple voxel grid-based model that improves over the standard MLP-based formulation in multiple dimensions and 2) introduce a new multi-frame loss formulation. 3) We combine both contributions in our new method, termed Floxels. On the Argoverse 2 benchmark, Floxels is surpassed only by EulerFlow among unsupervised methods while achieving comparable performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Floxels achieves a massive speedup of more than 60-140x over EulerFlow, reducing the runtime from a day to 10 minutes per sequence.

    "abstract": "Recent video large language models (Video LLMs) often depend on costly human annotations or proprietary APIs (e.g., GPT-4o) to produce training data, which limits their training at scale. In this paper, we explore large-scale training for Video LLM with cheap automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts. Specifically, we propose a novel streaming training approach that densely interleaves the ASR words and video frames according to their timestamps. Compared to previous studies in vision-language representation with ASR, our method naturally fits the streaming characteristics of ASR, thus enabling the model to learn temporally-aligned, fine-grained vision-language modeling. To support the training algorithm, we introduce a data pipeline for YouTube videos and their closed captions (CC), resulting in \\texttt Live-CC-10M pre-training set and \\texttt Live-WhisperX-408K high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) set. Remarkably, even without SFT, the pre-trained model \\texttt LiveCC-7B demonstrates significant improvements in general video QA and exhibits a new capability in real-time video commentary. To evaluate this, we carefully design a new benchmark \\texttt LiveSports-3K , using LLM-as-a-judge to measure the free-form commentary. Experiments show our final model \\texttt LiveCC-7B can surpass LLaVA-Video-72B in commentary quality even working in a real-time mode.

However, SDS often suffers from blurriness caused by noisy gradients. When SDS meets the image editing, such degradations can be reduced by adjusting bias shifts using reference pairs, but the de-biasing techniques are still corrupted by erroneous gradients. To this end, we introduce Identity-preserving Distillation Sampling (IDS), which compensates for the gradient leading to undesired changes in the results. Based on the analysis that these errors come from the text-conditioned scores, a new regularization technique, called fixed-point iterative regularization (FPR), is proposed to modify the score itself, driving the preservation of the identity even including poses and structures. Thanks to a self-correction by FPR, the proposed method provides clear and unambiguous representations corresponding to the given prompts in image-to-image editing and editable neural radiance field (NeRF).

These unnecessary similarity calculations not only degrade the reconstruction performance but also introduce significant computational overhead. How to accurately identify the features that are important to the current query features and avoid similarity calculations between irrelevant features remains an urgent problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel and effective Progressive Focused Transformer (PFT) that links all isolated attention maps in the network through Progressive Focused Attention (PFA) to focus attention on the most important tokens.

In this work, we propose to combine \"the best of both worlds\": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding. Our contributions include (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses.

However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability.

Existing attention-based transformers often struggle to accurately model the spatial arrangement of keypoints, especially in occluded scenarios. Additionally, they tend to overfit specific camera arrangements and visual scenes from training data, resulting in substantial performance drops in new settings. In this study, we introduce a novel Multi-View State Space Modeling framework, named MV-SSM, for robustly estimating 3D human keypoints. We explicitly model the joint spatial sequence at two distinct levels: the feature level from multi-view images and the person keypoint level. We propose a Projective State Space (PSS) block to learn a generalized representation of joint spatial arrangements using state space modeling. Moreover, we modify Mamba's traditional scanning into an effective Grid Token-guided Bidirectional Scanning (GTBS), which is integral to the PSS block. Multiple experiments demonstrate that MV-SSM achieves strong generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods: +10.8 on AP25 on the challenging three-camera setting in CMU Panoptic, +7.0 on AP25 on varying camera arrangements, and +15.3 PCP on Campus A1 in cross-dataset evaluations.

To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames.

To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes",

We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. Furthermore, we devise an ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence through tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision Foundation Model for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection.

    "abstract": "Temporal Awareness, the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised, is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models, which rely on complete videos for static, post hoc analysis, online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance, temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap, we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark), a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks, featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2,800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples, we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that, despite advancements on traditional benchmarks, current models struggle with online video understanding, showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://joeleelyf.github.io/OVO-Bench",

While Transformer-based methods have shown promising results in modeling inter-modal relationships, their quadratic computational complexity limits their applicability to long-sequence or large-scale data. Although recent Mamba-based approaches achieve linear complexity, their sequential scanning mechanism poses fundamental challenges in comprehensively modeling cross-modal relationships. To address this limitation, we propose AlignMamba, an efficient and effective method for multimodal fusion. Specifically, grounded in Optimal Transport, we introduce a local cross-modal alignment module that explicitly learns token-level correspondences between different modalities. Moreover, we propose a global cross-modal alignment loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy to implicitly enforce the consistency between different modal distributions. Finally, the unimodal representations after local and global alignment are passed to the Mamba backbone for further cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on complete and incomplete multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. For instance, on the CMU-MOSI dataset, AlignMamba improves classification accuracy by 0.9%, reduces GPU memory usage by 20.3%, and decreases inference time by 83.3%",

Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions, YouCook2), we construct two compositional benchmarks, ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp. We create challenging negative samples with subtle temporal disruptions such as reordering, action word replacement, partial captioning, and combined disruptions. These benchmarks comprehensively test models' compositional sensitivity across extended, cohesive video-text sequences. To improve model performance, we propose a hierarchical pairwise preference loss that strengthens alignment with temporally accurate pairs and gradually penalizes increasingly disrupted ones, encouraging fine-grained compositional learning. To mitigate the limited availability of densely annotated video data, we introduce a pretraining strategy that concatenates short video-caption pairs to simulate multi-event sequences. We evaluate video-text foundational models and large multimodal models (LMMs) on our benchmark, identifying both strengths and areas for improvement in compositionality.

While in-context learning (ICL) has shown promise across tasks by using a single model with task-specific demonstration prompts, its application to PCP reveals significant limitations. We identify inter-task and intra-task sensitivity issues in current ICL methods for PCP, which we attribute to inflexible sampling strategies lacking context adaptation at the point and prompt levels. To address these challenges, we propose MICAS, an advanced ICL framework featuring a multi-grained adaptive sampling mechanism tailored for PCP. MICAS introduces two core components: task-adaptive point sampling, which leverages inter-task cues for point-level sampling, and query-specific prompt sampling, which selects optimal prompts per query to mitigate intra-task sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce adaptive sampling tailored to the unique requirements of point clouds within an ICL framework. Extensive experiments show that MICAS not only efficiently handles various PCP tasks but also significantly outperforms existing methods.

    "abstract": "Recent video-language alignment models are trained on sets of videos, each with an associated positive caption and a negative caption generated by large language models. A problem with this procedure is that negative captions may introduce linguistic biases, i.e., concepts are seen only as negatives and never associated with a video. While a solution would be to collect videos for the negative captions, existing databases lack the fine-grained variations needed to cover all possible negatives. In this work, we study whether synthetic videos can help to overcome this issue. Our preliminary analysis with multiple generators shows that, while promising on some tasks, synthetic videos harm the performance of the model on others. We hypothesize this issue is linked to noise (semantic and visual) in the generated videos and develop a method, SynViTA, that accounts for those. SynViTA dynamically weights the contribution of each synthetic video based on how similar its target caption is w.r.t. the real counterpart. Moreover, a semantic consistency loss makes the model focus on fine-grained differences across captions, rather than differences in video appearance. Experiments show that, on average, SynViTA improves over existing methods on VideoCon test sets and SSv2-Temporal, SSv2-Events, and ATP-Hard benchmarks, being a first promising step for using synthetic videos when learning video-language models",

In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions.

To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods.

To this end, we propose a SfM registration dataset generation pipeline, leveraging partial reconstructions from synthetically generated camera trajectories for each scene. Finally, we propose a simple but impactful neural refiner on top of the SotA registration method RoITr that yields significant improvements, which we call RefineRoITr. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our proposed pipeline and model enables ColabSfM. Code is available at https://github.com/EricssonResearch/ColabSfM",

    "abstract": "The current state-of-the-art video generative models can produce commercial-grade videos with highly realistic details. However, they still struggle to coherently present multiple sequential events in specific short stories, which is foreseeable an essential capability for future long video generation scenarios. For example, top T2V generative models still fail to generate a video of the short simple story \"how to put an elephant into a refrigerator.\" While existing detail-oriented benchmarks primarily focus on fine-grained metrics like aesthetic quality and spatial-temporal consistency, they fall short of evaluating models' abilities to handle event-level story presentation. To address this gap, we introduce StoryEval, a story-oriented benchmark specifically designed to assess text-to-video (T2V) models' story-completion capabilities. StoryEval features 423 prompts spanning 7 classes, each representing short stories composed of 2-4 consecutive events. We employ Vision-Language Models, such as GPT-4o and LLaVA-OV-Chat-72B, to verify the completion of each event in the generated videos, applying a unanimous voting method to enhance reliability. Our methods ensure high alignment with human evaluations, and the evaluation of 11 models reveals its challenge, with none exceeding an average story-completion rate of 50%. StoryEval provides a new benchmark for advancing T2V models and highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing next-generation solutions for coherent story-driven video generation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recovering 3D Human-Object Interaction (HOI) from single color images is challenging due to depth ambiguities, occlusions, and the huge variation in object shape and appearance. Thus, past work requires controlled settings such as known object shapes and contacts, and tackles only limited object classes. Instead, we need methods that generalize to natural images and novel object classes. We tackle this in two main ways:(1) We collect PICO-db, a new dataset of natural images uniquely paired with dense 3D contact correspondences on both body and object meshes. To this end, we use images from the recent DAMON dataset that are paired with annotated contacts, but only on a canonical 3D body. In contrast, we seek contact labels on both the body and the object. To infer these given an image, we retrieve an appropriate 3D object mesh from a database by leveraging vision foundation models. Then, we project DAMON's body contact patches onto the object via a novel method needing only 2 clicks per patch. This minimal human input establishes rich contact correspondences between bodies and objects. (2) We exploit our new dataset in a novel render-and-compare fitting method, called PICO-fit, to recover 3D body and object meshes in interaction. PICO-fit infers contact for the SMPL-X body, retrieves a likely 3D object mesh and contact from PICO-db for that object, and uses the contact to iteratively fit the 3D body and object meshes to image evidence via optimization. Uniquely, PICO-fit works well for many object categories that no existing method can tackle. This is crucial for scaling HOI understanding in the wild.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Determining the vanishing points (VPs) in a Manhattan world, as a fundamental task in many 3D vision applications, consists of jointly inferring the line-VP association and locating each VP. Existing methods are, however, either sub-optimal solvers or pursuing global optimality at a significant cost of computing time. In contrast to prior works, we introduce convex relaxation techniques to solve this task for the first time. Specifically, we employ a \"soft\" association scheme, realized via a truncated multi-selection error, that allows for joint estimation of VPs' locations and line-VP associations. This approach leads to a primal problem that can be reformulated into a quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, which is then relaxed into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. To solve this SDP problem efficiently, we present a globally optimal outlier-robust iterative solver (called GlobustVP), which independently searches for one VP and its associated lines in each iteration, treating other lines as outliers. After each independent update of all VPs, the mutual orthogonality between the three VPs in a Manhattan world is reinforced via local refinement. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GlobustVP achieves a favorable balance between efficiency, robustness, and global optimality compared to previous works.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Text images are unique in their dual nature, encompassing both visual and linguistic information. The visual component encompasses structural and appearance-based features, while the linguistic dimension incorporates contextual and semantic elements. In scenarios with degraded visual quality, linguistic patterns serve as crucial supplements for comprehension, highlighting the necessity of integrating both aspects for robust scene text recognition (STR). Contemporary STR approaches often use language models or semantic reasoning modules to capture linguistic features, typically requiring large-scale annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning, which lacks annotations, presents challenges in disentangling linguistic features related to the global context. Typically, sequence contrastive learning emphasizes the alignment of local features, while masked image modeling (MIM) tends to exploit local structures to reconstruct visual patterns, resulting in limited linguistic knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Linguistics-aware Masked Image Modeling (LMIM) approach, which channels the linguistic information into the decoding process of MIM through a separate branch. Specifically, we design a linguistics alignment module to extract vision-independent features as linguistic guidance using inputs with different visual appearances. As features extend beyond mere visual structures, LMIM must consider the global context to achieve reconstruction. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks quantitatively demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, and attention visualizations qualitatively show the simultaneous capture of both visual and linguistic information.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In the real world, objects reveal internal textures when sliced or cut, yet this behavior is not well-studied in 3D generation tasks today. For example, slicing a virtual 3D watermelon should reveal flesh and seeds. Given that no available dataset captures an object's full internal structure and collecting data from all slices is impractical, generative methods become the obvious approach. However, current 3D generation and inpainting methods often focus on visible appearance and overlook internal textures. To bridge this gap, we introduce FruitNinja, the first method to generate internal textures for 3D objects undergoing geometric and topological changes. Our approach produces objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both surface and interior textures synthesized, enabling real-time slicing and rendering without additional optimization. FruitNinja leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to progressively inpaint cross-sectional views and applies voxel-grid-based smoothing to achieve cohesive textures throughout the object. Our OpaqueAtom GS strategy overcomes 3DGS limitations by employing densely distributed opaque Gaussians, avoiding biases toward larger particles that destabilize training and sharp color transitions for fine-grained textures. Experimental results show that FruitNinja substantially outperforms existing approaches, showcasing unmatched visual quality in real-time rendered internal views across arbitrary geometry manipulations.

QueryMeldNet, a novel segmentation framework, is introduced and designed to scale seamlessly across both data size and task diversity. It is built upon a dynamic object query mechanism called query meld, which fuses different types of queries using cross-attention. This hybrid approach enables the model to balance between instance- and stuff-level segmentation, providing enhanced scalability for handling diverse object types. We further enhance scalability by leveraging synthetic data-generating segmentation masks and captions for pixel-level and open-vocabulary tasks-drastically reducing the need for costly human annotations. By training on multiple datasets and tasks at scale, QueryMeldNet continuously improves performance as the volume and diversity of data and tasks increase. It exhibits strong generalization capabilities, boosting performance in open-set segmentation tasks SeginW by 7 points.

The hard sample segmentation module utilizes the diffusion process for feature augmentation and incorporates a more sophisticated segmentation network to achieve precise segmentation. We justify our motivation through solid theoretical analysis and extensive experiments. Evaluations across various modalities show that our L2S outperforms other SOTA methods, particularly by substantially improving the segmentation accuracy of hard samples.

However, existing models are confronted with two issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output.

MIMOSeg is constructed from four different perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question answering with multimodal input and multimodal output.

Given compact non-linear activation functions, we hypothesize that an INR's biases are suitable to capture motion across images, and facilitate compact representations for video sequences. Using these observations, we design ActINR to share INR weights across frames of a video sequence, while using unique biases for each frame. We further model the biases as the output of a separate INR conditioned on time index to promote smoothness. By training the video INR and this bias INR together, we demonstrate unique capabilities, including 10x video slow motion, 4x spatial super resolution along with 2x slow motion, denoising, and video inpainting.

In line with the philosophy of \"future is a continuation of past\", we propose **BridgeAD**, which reformulates motion and planning queries as multi-step queries to differentiate the queries for each future time step. This design enables the effective use of historical prediction and planning by applying them to the appropriate parts of the end-to-end system based on the time steps, which improves both perception and motion planning. Specifically, historical queries for the current frame are combined with perception, while queries for future frames are integrated with motion planning. In this way, we bridge the gap between past and future by aggregating historical insights at every time step, enhancing the overall coherence and accuracy of the end-to-end autonomous driving pipeline.

    "abstract": "Estimating blood flow speed is essential in many medical and physiological applications, yet it is extremely challenging due to complex vascular structure and flow dynamics, particularly for cerebral cortex regions. Existing techniques, such as Optical Doppler Tomography (ODT), generally require complex hardware control and signal processing, and still suffer from inherent system-level artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose a new learning-based approach named OCTA-Flow, which directly estimates vascular blood flow speed from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images that are commonly used for vascular structure analysis. OCTA-Flow employs several novel components to achieve this goal. First, using an encoder-decoder architecture, OCTA-Flow leverages ODT data as pseudo labels during training, thus bypassing the difficulty of collecting ground truth data. Second, to capture the relationship between vessels of varying scales and their flow speed, we design an Adaptive Window Fusion module that employs multiscale window attention. Third, to mitigate ODT artifacts, we incorporate a Conditional Random Field Decoder that promotes smoothness and consistency in the estimated blood flow. Together, these innovations enable OCTA-Flow to effectively produce accurate flow estimation, suppress the artifacts in ODT, and enhance practicality, benefiting from the established techniques of OCTA data acquisition.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Aiming to achieve class-agnostic perception in visual object tracking, current trackers commonly formulate tracking as a one-shot detection problem with the template-matching architecture. Despite the success, severe environmental variations in long-term tracking raise challenges to generalizing the tracker in novel situations. Temporal trackers try to fix it by preserving the time-validity of target information with historical predictions, e.g., updating the template. However, solely transmitting the previous observations instead of learning from them leads to an inferior capability of understanding the tracking scenario from past experience, which is critical for the generalization in new frames. To address this issue, we reformulate temporal learning in visual tracking as a History-to-Future process and propose a novel tracking framework DreamTrack. Our DreamTrack learns the temporal dynamics from past observations to dream the future variations of the environment, which boosts the generalization with the extended future information from history. Considering the uncertainty of future variation, multimodal prediction is designed to infer the target trajectory of each possible future situation. The experiments demonstrate that our DreamTrack achieves leading performance with real-time inference speed. In particular, DreamTrack obtains SUC scores of 76.6%/87.9% on LaSOT/TrackingNet, surpassing all recent SOTA trackers",

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image-generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability.In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, Our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames.Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of diffusion models has fueled a growing demand for customized image generation. However, current customization methods face several limitations: 1) typically accept either image or text conditions alone; 2) customization in complex visual scenarios often leads to subject leakage or confusion; 3) image-conditioned outputs tend to suffer from inconsistent backgrounds; and 4) high computational costs. To address these issues, this paper introduces Multi-party Collaborative Attention Control (MCA-Ctrl), a tuning-free approach that enables high-quality image customization under both text and complex visual conditions. Specifically, MCA-Ctrl leverages two key operations within the self-attention layer to coordinate multiple parallel diffusion processes and guide the target image generation. This approach allows MCA-Ctrl to capture the content and appearance of specific subjects while maintaining semantic consistency with the conditional input. Additionally, to mitigate subject leakage and confusion issues common in complex visual scenarios, we introduce a Subject Localization Module that extracts precise subject and editable image layers based on user instructions. Extensive quantitative and human evaluation experiments demonstrate that MCA-Ctrl outperforms previous methods in zero-shot image customization, effectively addressing the aforementioned issues",

Empirical analysis evidences that despite image features of OOP concepts born with significant category margins, their zero-shot transfer significantly fails due to the poor image-text alignment. To this, we elaborate the \"name-tuning\" methodology with its theoretical merits in terms of OOP generalization, then propose few-shot name learning (FSNL) and zero-shot name learning (ZSNL) algorithms to achieve OOP generalization in a data-efficient manner.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce SA-V-128, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

However, existing methods often fail to reconstruct physically based material properties given a single image, limiting their applicability in complicated scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach (named MAGE) for generating 3D geometry with realistic decomposed material properties given a single image as input. Our method leverages inspiration from traditional computer graphics deferred rendering pipelines to introduce a multi-view G-buffer estimation model. The proposed model estimates G-buffers for various views as multi-domain images, including XYZ coordinates, normals, albedo, roughness, and metallic properties from a single-view RGB image. To address the inherent ambiguity and inconsistency in generating G-buffers simultaneously, we also formulate a deterministic network from the pretrained diffusion models and propose a lighting response loss that enforces consistency across these domains using PBR principles. Finally, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset rich in material diversity for our model training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-quality 3D meshes with rich material properties.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in dataset distillation have led to solutions in two main directions. The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for small-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and syntheses, such as FRePo, RCIG, and RaT-BPTT, as well as other methods like distribution matching, gradient matching, and weight trajectory matching. Conversely, batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods, which are particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered substantial interest within the community, as seen in SRe^2L, G-VBSM, WMDD, and CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity among syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and the same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic images. In this study, we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training (DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching with less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective, it partitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local optimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases, reducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process. These distilled images from the subtasks demonstrate effective generalization when applied to the entire task. We conduct extensive experiments on CIFAR, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1K, and its sub-datasets. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 2~5% on average across different datasets and IPCs (images per class), increasing diversity per class by more than 5% while reducing synthesis time by up to 39.3% for enhancing the training efficiency",

However, existing methods mainly focus on extracting semantic information from images and then simply concatenating it with 3D point clouds without further exploring the concatenated semantics. As a result, these entangled semantic features significantly hinder the reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel single-image 3D reconstruction method called Mining Effective Semantic Cues for 3D Reconstruction from a Single Image (MESC-3D), which can actively mine effective semantic cues from entangled features. Specifically, we design an Effective Semantic Mining Module, which incorporates a point-selection map establish connections between point clouds and semantic attributes, enabling the point clouds to autonomously select the necessary information. Furthermore, to address the potential insufficiencies in semantic information from a single image, such as occlusions, inspired by the human ability to represent 3D objects using prior knowledge drawn from daily experiences, we introduce a 3D Semantic Prior Learning Module. This module employs contrastive learning paradigm along with a learnable text prompt to incorporates semantic understanding of spatial structures, enabling the model to interpret and reconstruct 3D objects with greater accuracy and realism, closely mirroring human perception of complex 3D environments. Extensive evaluations show that our method achieves significant improvements in reconstruction quality and robustness compared to prior works.

However, conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets, as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution, but often sees limited improvements. In this paper, we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL:Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions, while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches, or \"pseudo-bags\" from WSIs.

    "abstract": "Human reasoning naturally combines concepts to identify unseen compositions, a capability that Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to replicate in machine learning models. However, we observe that focusing solely on typical image classification tasks in CZSL may limit models' compositional generalization potential. To address this, we introduce C-EgoExo, a video-based benchmark, along with a compositional action recognition task to enable more comprehensive evaluations. Inspired by human reasoning processes, we propose a Dual-branch Hybrid Discrimination (DHD) framework, featuring two branches that decode visual inputs in distinct observation sequences. Through a cross-attention mechanism and a contextual dependency encoder, DHD effectively mitigates challenges posed by conditional variance. We further design a Copula-based orthogonal decoding loss to counteract contextual interference in primitive decoding. Our approach demonstrates outstanding performance across diverse CZSL tasks, excelling in both image-based and video-based modalities and in attribute-object and action-object compositions, setting a new benchmark for CZSL evaluation",

    "abstract": "Weakly supervised Oriented Object Detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox) supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO that is a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses the limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with predicted RBoxes' minimum circumscribed rectangles, often leading to inaccuracies. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS) that appropriately scales the GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate prediction for RBoxes' scales; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that uses the inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, addressing the issue in previous methods where learning fails if they consistently make incorrect predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped).

To derive this, we first propose a theoretical framework to analyze the general form of unlearning loss and decompose it into forgetting and retention terms. Through the theoretical framework, we point out that a class of previous methods could be mainly formulated as a loss that implicitly optimizes the forgetting term while lacking supervision for the retention term, disturbing the distribution of pre-trained model and struggling to adequately preserve knowledge of the remaining classes. To address it, we refine the retention term using \"dark knowledge\" and propose a mask distillation unlearning method. By applying a mask to separate forgetting logits from retention logits, our approach optimizes both the forgetting and refined retention components simultaneously, retaining knowledge of the remaining classes while ensuring thorough forgetting of the target class. Without access to the remaining data or intervention (i.e., used in some works), we achieve state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Adversarial robustness remains a significant challenge in deploying deep neural networks for real-world applications. While adversarial training is widely acknowledged as a promising defense strategy, most existing studies primarily focus on balanced datasets, neglecting the fact that real-world data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which introduces substantial challenges to robustness. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of adversarial training in the context of long-tailed distributions and identify the limitations of the current state-of-the-art method, AT-BSL, in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework, TAET, which incorporates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified, equalization adversarial training phase. Furthermore, prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely overlooked a crucial evaluation metric--Balanced Accuracy. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of Balanced Robustness, a comprehensive metric that measures robustness specifically under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing advanced defenses, yielding significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency. We believe this work represents a substantial step forward in tackling robustness challenges in real-world applications.

However, existing methods for training scanpath prediction models are data-intensive and cannot be effectively personalized to new individuals with only a few available examples. In this paper, we propose few-shot personalized scanpath prediction task (FS-PSP) and a novel method to address it, which aims to predict scanpaths for an unseen subject using minimal support data of that subject's scanpath behavior. The key to our method's adaptability is the Subject-Embedding Network (SE-Net), specifically designed to capture unique, individualized representations for each subject's scanpaths. SE-Net generates subject embeddings that effectively distinguish between subjects while minimizing variability among scanpaths from the same individual. The personalized scanpath prediction model is then conditioned on these subject embeddings to produce accurate, personalized results.

    "title": "Do Your Best and Get Enough Rest for Continual Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "According to the forgetting curve theory, we can enhance memory retention by learning extensive data and taking adequate rest. This means that in order to effectively retain new knowledge, it is essential to learn it thoroughly and ensure sufficient rest so that our brain can memorize without forgetting. The main takeaway from this theory is that learning extensive data at once necessitates sufficient rest before learning the same data again. This aspect of human long-term memory retention can be effectively utilized to address the continual learning of neural networks. Retaining new knowledge for a long period of time without catastrophic forgetting is the critical problem of continual learning. Therefore, based on Ebbinghaus' theory, we introduce the view-batch model that adjusts the learning schedules to optimize the recall interval between retraining the same samples. The proposed view-batch model allows the network to get enough rest to learn extensive knowledge from the same samples with a recall interval of sufficient length. To this end, we specifically present two approaches: 1) a replay method that guarantees the optimal recall interval, and 2) a self-supervised learning that acquires extensive knowledge from a single training sample at a time. We empirically show that these approaches of our method are aligned with the forgetting curve theory, which can enhance long-term memory. In our experiments, we also demonstrate that our method significantly improves many state-of-the-art continual learning methods in various protocols and scenarios.

At the core of our approach is a novel Bilevel Modality Calibration (BiMC) strategy. Our framework initially performs intra-modal calibration, combining LLM-generated fine-grained category descriptions with visual prototypes from the base session to achieve precise classifier estimation. This is further complemented by inter-modal calibration that fuses pre-trained linguistic knowledge with task-specific visual priors to mitigate modality-specific biases.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "DUSt3R introduced a novel paradigm in geometric computer vision by proposing a model that can provide dense and unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction of arbitrary image collections with no prior information about camera calibration nor viewpoint poses. Under the hood, however, DUSt3R processes image pairs, regressing local 3D reconstructions that need to be aligned in a global coordinate system. The number of pairs, growing quadratically, is an inherent limitation that becomes especially concerning for robust and fast optimization in the case of large image collections. In this paper, we propose an extension of DUSt3R from pairs to multiple views, that addresses all aforementioned concerns. Indeed, we propose a Multi-view Network for Stereo 3D Reconstruction, or MUSt3R, that modifies the DUSt3R architecture by making it symmetric and extending it to directly predict 3D structure for all views in a common coordinate frame. Second, we entail the model with a multi-layer memory mechanism which allows to reduce the computational complexity and to scale the reconstruction to large collections, inferring thousands of 3D pointmaps at high frame-rates with limited added complexity. The framework is designed to perform 3D reconstruction both offline and online, and hence can be seamlessly applied to SfM and visual SLAM scenarios showing state-of-the-art performance on various 3D downstream tasks, including uncalibrated Visual Odometry, relative camera pose, scale and focal estimation, 3D reconstruction and multi-view depth estimation",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been challenged by the computational overhead resulting from massive video frames, often alleviated through compression strategies. However, the visual content is not equally contributed to user instructions, existing strategies (e.g., average pool) inevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this, we propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional Token Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to guide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the compression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while reducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the instruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local level and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the attention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the hybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted while the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding of LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new conditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K. Experiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding ability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43% average on three multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8% tokens compared with the SOTA method.

    "abstract": "Point cloud videos can faithfully capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing world. However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with the unified spatial-temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4D achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Mamba4D also has a significant efficiency improvement, especially for long video sequences, with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

However, existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs, overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g., DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs (e.g., CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths, effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging, as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this, we propose MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser, which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods, achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

In particular, the latest methods leverage human gaze points, using their spatial coordinates to indicate intent--where a person might move within a 3D environment.

To address this, we propose GAP3DS, an affordance-aware HMP model that utilizes gaze-informed object affordances to improve HMP in complex 3D environments. GAP3DS incorporates a gaze-guided affordance learner to identify relevant objects in the scene and infer their affordances based on human gaze, thus contextualizing future human-object interactions. This affordance information, enriched with visual features and gaze data, conditions the generation of multiple human-object interaction poses, which are subsequently decoded into final motion predictions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that GAP3DS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both trajectory and pose accuracy, producing more physically consistent and contextually grounded predictions.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-embodiment data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in the Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. Moreover, the universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions",

    "abstract": "Simple as it seems, moving an object to another location within an image is, in fact, a challenging image-editing task that requires re-harmonizing the lighting, adjusting the pose based on perspective, accurately filling occluded regions, and ensuring coherent synchronization of shadows and reflections while maintaining the object identity. In this paper, we present ObjectMover, a generative model that can perform object movement in highly challenging scenes. Our key insight is that we model this task as a sequence-to-sequence problem and fine-tune a video generation model to leverage its knowledge of consistent object generation across video frames. We show that with this approach, our model is able to adjust to complex real-world scenarios, handling extreme lighting harmonization and object effect movement. As large-scale data for object movement are unavailable, we construct a data generation pipeline using a modern game engine to synthesize high-quality data pairs. We further propose a multi-task learning strategy that enables training on real-world video data to improve the model generalization. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ObjectMover achieves outstanding results and adapts well to real-world scenarios",

    "abstract": "Faithful image super-resolution (SR) not only needs to recover images that appear realistic, similar to image generation tasks, but also requires that the restored images maintain fidelity and structural consistency with the input. To this end, we propose a simple and effective method, named FaithDiff, to fully harness the impressive power of latent diffusion models (LDMs) for faithful image SR. In contrast to existing diffusion-based SR methods that freeze the diffusion model pre-trained on high-quality images, we propose to unleash the diffusion prior to identify useful information and recover faithful structures. As there exists a significant gap between the features of degraded inputs and the noisy latent from the diffusion model, we then develop an effective alignment module to explore useful features from degraded inputs to align well with the diffusion process. Considering the indispensable roles and interplay of the encoder and diffusion model in LDMs, we jointly fine-tune them in a unified optimization framework, facilitating the encoder to extract useful features that coincide with diffusion process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FaithDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing high-quality and faithful SR results",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks",

To address this dilemma, we introduce a new task, Scene-agnostic Pose Regression (SPR), which can achieve accurate pose regression in a flexible way while eliminating the need for retraining or databases.

In SfM, pose graph vertices represent images, and edges represent relative poses (rotations and translations) between cameras. We reformulate the edge filtering problem as a vertex filtering in the dual graph, specifically, a line graph where vertices correspond to edges in the original graph and edges correspond to cameras. Utilizing this representation, we frame the problem as a binary classification over nodes in the dual graph. To identify outlier edges, we employ a Transformer-based architecture. To overcome the challenge of memory overflow caused by converting to a line graph, we introduce a clustering-based graph processing approach, enabling our method to be applied to arbitrarily large pose graphs. Our method outperforms existing relative translation filtering techniques in terms of camera position accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with other filters.

    "abstract": "Existing diffusion-based purification methods aim to disrupt adversarial perturbations by introducing a certain amount of noise through a forward diffusion process, followed by a reverse process to recover clean examples. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling.

Recently, prompt-based CIL approaches leverage ample data to train prompts, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, these methods do not account for the semantic features embedded in prompts, exacerbating the plasticity-stability dilemma in few-shot incremental learning. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple framework named SEmantic Complementary Prompt(SEC-Prompt), which learns two sets of semantically complementary prompts based on an adaptive query: discriminative prompts(D-Prompt) and non-discriminative prompts(ND-Prompt). D-Prompt enhances the separation of class-specific feature distributions by strengthening key discriminative features, while ND-Prompt balances non-discriminative information to promote generalization to novel classes. To efficiently learn high-quality knowledge from limited samples, we leverage ND-Prompt for data augmentation to increase sample diversity and introduce Prompt Clustering Loss to prevent noise contamination in D-Prompt, ensuring robust discriminative feature learning and improved generalization.

Prior methods have leveraged generative models to reduce the reliance for dense supervision. However, this often limits their capacity to model complex data distributions. Alternatively, transformer networks with a sparse contrastive loss have been explored, but their over-relaxed regularization often leads to imprecise object placement. We introduce BOOTPLACE, a novel paradigm that formulates object placement as a placement-by-detection problem. Our approach begins by identifying suitable regions of interest for object placement. This is achieved by training a specialized detection transformer on object-subtracted backgrounds, enhanced with multi-object supervisions. It then semantically associates each target compositing object with detected regions based on their complementary characteristics. Through a boostrapped training approach applied to randomly object-subtracted images, our model enforces meaningful placements through extensive paired data augmentation. Experimental results on established benchmarks demonstrate BOOTPLACE's superior performance in object repositioning, markedly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on Cityscapes and OPA datasets with notable improvements in IOU scores. Additional ablation studies further showcase the compositionality and generalizability of our approach, supported by user study evaluations.

    "abstract": "Correct use of electrical appliances has significantly improved human life quality. Unlike simple tools that can be manipulated with common sense, different parts of electrical appliances have specific functions defined by manufacturers. If we want the robot to heat bread by microwave, we should enable them to review the microwave's manual first. From the manual, it can learn about component functions, interaction methods, and representative task steps about appliances. However, previous manual-related works remain limited to question-answering tasks while existing manipulation researchers ignore the manual's important role and fail to comprehend multi-page manuals. In this paper, we propose the first manual-based appliance manipulation benchmark CheckManual. Specifically, we design a large model-assisted human-revised data generation pipeline to create manuals based on CAD appliance models. With these manuals, we establish novel manual-based manipulation challenges, metrics, and simulator environments for model performance evaluation. Furthermore, we propose the first manual-based manipulation planning model ManualPlan to set up a group of baselines for the CheckManual benchmark",

Despite significant progress, we believe that the task has reached a bottleneck due to the limited benchmark datasets and the existing large models' insufficient capability enhancements in this specialized domain. Specifically, the recently released CheXpert Plus dataset lacks comparative evaluation algorithms and their results, providing only the dataset itself. This situation makes the training, evaluation, and comparison of subsequent algorithms challenging. Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of existing mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models (LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset. We believe that the proposed benchmark can provide a solid comparative basis for subsequent algorithms and serve as a guide for researchers to quickly grasp the state-of-the-art models in this field. More importantly, we propose a large model for the X-ray image report generation using a multi-stage pre-training strategy, including self-supervised autoregressive generation and Xray-report contrastive learning, and supervised fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Recent top-performing temporal 3D detectors based on Lidars have increasingly adopted region-based paradigms. They first generate coarse proposals, followed by encoding and fusing regional features. However, indiscriminate sampling and fusion often overlook the varying contributions of individual points and lead to exponentially increased complexity as the number of input frames grows. Moreover, arbitrary result-level concatenation limits the global information extraction. In this paper, we propose a Focal Token Acquring-and-Scaling Transformer (FASTer), which dynamically selects focal tokens and condenses token sequences in an adaptive and lightweight manner. Emphasizing the contribution of individual tokens, we propose a simple but effective Adaptive Scaling mechanism to capture geometric contexts while sifting out focal points. Adaptively storing and processing only focal points in historical frames dramatically reduces the overall complexity. Furthermore, a novel Grouped Hierarchical Fusion strategy is proposed, progressively performing sequence scaling and Intra-Group Fusion operations to facilitate the exchange of global spatial and temporal information. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our FASTer significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art detectors in both performance and efficiency while also exhibiting improved flexibility and robustness.

    "abstract": "Dense video captioning aims to localize and caption all events in arbitrary untrimmed videos. Although previous methods have achieved appealing results, they still face the issue of temporal bias, i.e, models tend to focus more on events with certain temporal characteristics. Specifically, 1) the temporal distribution of events in training datasets is uneven. Models trained on these datasets will pay less attention to out-of-distribution events. 2) long-duration events have more frame features than short ones and will attract more attention. To address this, we argue that events, with varying temporal characteristics, should be treated equally when it comes to dense video captioning. Intuitively, different events tend to have distinct visual differences due to varied camera views, backgrounds, or subjects. Inspired by that, we intend to utilize visual features to have an approximate perception of possible events and pay equal attention to them. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective framework, called Event-Equalized Dense Video Captioning(E^2DVC) to overcome the temporal bias and treat all possible events equally. Specifically, an event perception module(EPM) is proposed to do uneven clustering on visual frame features to generate pseudo-events. We enforce the model's attention to these pseudo-events through the pseudo-event initialization module(PEI). A novel event-enhanced encoder(EEE) is also devised to enhance the model's ability to explore frame-frame and frame-event relationships.

Our method addresses this challenge to deliver efficient, high-quality novel-view synthesis with view and temporal consistency. The key innovation of our approach lies in using global geometry to guide an image-based rendering pipeline. To accomplish this, we progressively refine depth maps using color difference masks across time. These depth maps are then accumulated through truncated signed distance fields in the synthesized view's image space. This depth representation is view and temporally consistent, and is used to guide a pre-trained blending network that fuses multiple forward-rendered input-view images. Thus, the network is encouraged to output geometrically consistent synthesis results across multiple views and time.

In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD.

    "abstract": "Why do gradient-based explanations struggle with Transformers, and how can we improve them? We identify gradient flow imbalances in Transformers that violate FullGrad-completeness, a critical property for attribution faithfulness that CNNs naturally possess. To address this issue, we introduce LibraGrad--a theoretically grounded post-hoc approach that corrects gradient imbalances through pruning and scaling of backward paths, without changing the forward pass or adding computational overhead. We evaluate LibraGrad using three metric families: Faithfulness, which quantifies prediction changes under perturbations of the most and least relevant features; Completeness Error, which measures attribution conservation relative to model outputs; and Segmentation AP, which assesses alignment with human perception. Extensive experiments across 8 architectures, 4 model sizes, and 5 datasets show that LibraGrad universally enhances gradient-based methods, outperforming existing white-box methods--including Transformer-specific approaches--across all metrics. We demonstrate superior qualitative results through two complementary evaluations: precise text-prompted region highlighting on CLIP models and accurate class discrimination between co-occurring animals on ImageNet-finetuned models--two settings on which existing methods often struggle. LibraGrad is effective even on the attention-free MLP-Mixer architecture, indicating potential for extension to other modern architectures.

    "abstract": "Bitstream-corrupted video recovery aims to fill in realistic video content due to bitstream corruption during video storage or transmission. Most existing methods typically assume that the predefined masks of the corrupted regions are known in advance. However, manually annotating these masks is laborious and time-consuming, limiting the applicability of existing methods in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video recovery setting where the recovery of corrupted regions does not rely on predefined masks. There are two significant challenges in this setting: (i) without predefined masks, how accurately can a model identify the regions requiring recovery? (ii) how to recover contents from extensive and irregular regions, especially when large portions of frames are severely degraded? To address these challenges, we introduce a Metadata-Guided Diffusion Model, dubbed M-GDM. To enable a diffusion model focusing on the corrupted regions, we leverage intrinsic video metadata as a corruption indicator and design a dual-stream metadata encoder. This encoder first embeds the motion vectors and frame types of a video separately and then merges them into a unified metadata representation. The metadata representation will interact with the corrupted latent feature through cross-attention mechanisms at each diffusion step. Meanwhile, to preserve the intact regions, we propose a prior-driven mask predictor that generates pseudo masks for the corrupted regions by leveraging the metadata prior and diffusion prior. These pseudo masks enable the separation and recombination of intact and recovered regions through hard masking. However, imperfections in pseudo mask predictions and hard masking processes often result in boundary artifacts. Thus, we introduce a post-refinement module that refines the hard-masked outputs, enhancing the consistency between intact and recovered regions.

In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape.

    "abstract": "Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) seeks to segment the objects within a video referred by linguistic expressions. Existing RVOS solutions follow a \"fuse then select\" paradigm: establishing semantic correlation between visual and linguistic feature, and performing frame-level query interaction to select the instance mask per frame with instance segmentation module. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of semantic gap between the linguistic descriptor and the video object as well as the underlying clutters in the video. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Sequential Alignment (SSA) paradigm to handle these challenges. We first insert a lightweight adapter after the vision language model (VLM) to perform the semantic alignment. Then, prior to selecting mask per frame, we exploit the trajectory-to-instance enhancement for each frame via sequential alignment. This paradigm leverages the visual-language alignment inherent in VLM during adaptation and tries to capture global information by ensembling trajectories. This helps understand videos and the corresponding descriptors by mitigating the discrepancy with intricate activity semantics, particularly when facing occlusion or similar interference.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. Code will be found in https://github.com/Kevinz-code/nSFT/",

    "abstract": "Skeleton-based human action recognition is promising due to its privacy preservation, robustness to visual challenges, and computational efficiency. Especially, the practical necessity to recognize unseen actions has led to increased interest in zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition (ZSSAR). Existing ZSSAR approaches often rely on manually crafted action descriptions or visual assumptions to enhance knowledge transfer, which is limited in flexibility and prone to inaccuracies and noise. To overcome this, we introduce Semantic-guided Cross-Modal Prompt Learning (SCoPLe), a novel framework that replaces manual guidance with data-driven prompt learning for refinement and alignment of skeletal and textual features. Specifically, we introduce a dual-stream language prompting module that preserves the original semantic context from the pre-trained text encoder while still effectively tuning its ouput for ZSSAR task adaptation. We also introduce a joint-shaped prompting module that learns tuning for skeleton features and incorporate an adaptive visual representation sampler that leverages text semantics to strengthen the cross-modal prompting interactions during skeleton-to-text embedding projection. Experimental results on the NTU-RGB+D and PKU-MMD datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method in both ZSSAR and generalized ZSSAR scenarios",

Although significant progress has been made in rendering performance and manipulation capabilities, notable challenges remain, including incomplete reconstruction and inefficient Gaussian representation. To address these challenges, we introduce FATE -- a novel method for reconstructing an editable full-head avatar from a single monocular video. FATE integrates a sampling-based densification strategy to ensure optimal positional distribution of points, improving rendering efficiency. A neural baking technique is introduced to convert discrete Gaussian representations into continuous attribute maps, facilitating intuitive appearance editing. Furthermore, we propose a universal completion framework to recover non-frontal appearance, culminating in a 360^\\circ-renderable 3D head avatar. FATE outperforms previous approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, FATE is the first animatable and 360^\\circ full-head monocular reconstruction method for a 3D head avatar.

This paper proposes Automatic T2I generation, which aims to automate these tedious steps, allowing users to simply describe their needs in a freestyle chatting way. To systematically study this problem, we first introduce ChatGenBench, a novel benchmark designed for Automatic T2I.

Additionally, recognizing Automatic T2I as a complex multi-step reasoning task, we propose ChatGen-Evo, a multi-stage evolution strategy that progressively equips models with essential automation skills.

Recently, although Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) have made great progress in general video understanding tasks, their capabilities in video editing understanding (VEU) tasks remain unexplored. To address this gap, in this paper, we introduce VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark that categorizes video editing components across various dimensions, from intra-frame features like shot size to inter-shot attributes such as cut types and transitions. Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19 fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars(Named after the Academy Awards.), a VEU expert model fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o. We also demonstrate that incorporating VEU data significantly enhances the performance of Vid-LLMs on general video understanding benchmarks, with an average improvement of 8.3% across nine reasoning tasks.

However, current methods often neglect the non-uniform complexity of images, limiting their ability to balance global perceptual quality with local texture consistency and to allocate coding resources efficiently. To address this, we introduce the Map-guided Masking Realism Image Diffusion Codec(MRIDC), designed to optimize the trade-off between local distortion and global perceptual quality in extreme-low bitrate compression. MRIDC integrates a vector-quantized image encoder with a diffusion-based decoder. On the encoding side, we propose a Map-guided Latent Masking(MLM) module, which selectively masks elements in the latent space based on prior information, allowing adaptive resource allocation aligned with image complexity. On the decoding side, masked latents are completed using the Bidirectional Prediction Controllable Generation(BPCG) module, which guides the constrained generation process within the diffusion model to reconstruct the image. Experimental results show that MRIDC achieves state-of-the-art perceptual compression quality at extremely low bitrates, effectively preserving feature consistency in key regions and advancing the rate-distortion-perception performance curve, establishing new benchmarks in balancing compression efficiency with visual fidelity",

Yo'Chameleon is trained with (i) a self-prompting optimization mechanism to balance performance across multiple modalities, and (ii) a \"soft-positive\" image generation approach to enhance image quality in a few-shot setting. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses reveal that Yo'Chameleon can learn concepts more efficiently using fewer tokens and effectively encode visual attributes, outperforming prompting baselines",

However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused byincomplete semantics of patches.Particularly, we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame.Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512 resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency",

One of the promising directions for achieving single-domain generalization is to generate out-of-domain (OOD) training data through data augmentation or image generation. Given the rapid advancements in AI-generated content (AIGC), this paper is the first to propose leveraging powerful pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) foundation models to create the training data. However, manually designing textual prompts to generate images for all possible domains is often impractical, and some domain characteristics may be too abstract to describe with words. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Progressive Adversarial Prompt Tuning (PAPT) framework for pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of relying on static textual domains, our approach learns two sets of abstract prompts as conditions for the diffusion model: one that captures domain-invariant category information and another that models domain-specific styles. This adversarial learning mechanism enables the T2I model to generate images in various domain styles while preserving key categorical features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving superior performances to state-of-the-art single-domain generalization approaches",

Current methods for automatic parameter estimation from video train supervised deep networks on large datasets. Such datasets require labels, which are difficult to acquire. While some unsupervised techniques--which depend on frame prediction--exist, they suffer from long training times, initialization instabilities, only consider motion-based dynamical systems, and are evaluated mainly on synthetic data. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method to estimate the physical parameters of known, continuous governing equations from single videos suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and robust to initialization. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and compute. We first evaluate our model on synthetic data, as commonly done. After which, we take the field closer to reality by recording Delfys75: our own real-world dataset of 75 videos for five different types of dynamical systems to evaluate our method and others.

    "abstract": "Visual artifacts remain a persistent challenge in diffusion models, even with training on massive datasets. Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors, yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis, we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling, Mutation, and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase, where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time, causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights, we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion), that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process, with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas. Unlike most existing methods that apply post hoc corrections, e.g., by applying a noising-denoising scheme after generation, our mitigation strategy operates seamlessly within the existing diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces artifacts across diverse domains, matching or surpassing existing supervised methods without additional training",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in image classification by training with large-scale paired image-text data. Their performances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show that visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the generalization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack discrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find visually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal supervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed to progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to class-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space shows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt generation costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we first introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based operations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs. Then, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search point and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we apply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting. In a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms existing textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description methods across 13 datasets. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that our optimal prompts improve adapter-based methods and transfer effectively across different backbones",

Specifically, we address the shortcomings of pixel-level \\mathcal L _\\text p loss (\\mathcal L _\\text pix ) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since \\mathcal L _\\text pix is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality, prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However, this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly, we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of \\mathcal L _\\text pix that contributes to blurring, and 2) guiding reconstruction only based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that this can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner, with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained using \\mathcal L _\\text pix . Based on this insight, we propose the Auto-Encoded Supervision for Optimal Penalization loss (\\mathcal L _\\text AESOP ), a novel loss function that measures distance in the AE space (the space after the decoder, not the bottleneck), rather than in the raw pixel space. By simply substituting \\mathcal L _\\text pix with \\mathcal L _\\text AESOP , we can provide effective reconstruction guidance without compromising perceptual quality.

    "abstract": "The commonsense reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), especially in abductive reasoning and defeasible reasoning, remain poorly understood. Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios, making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills, or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos, clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce BlackSwanSuite, a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks. Our tasks artificially limit the amount of visual information provided to models while questioning them about hidden unexpected events, or provide new visual information that could change an existing hypothesis about the event. We curate a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising over 3,800 MCQ, 4,900 generative and 6,700 yes/no questions, spanning 1,655 videos. After extensively evaluating various state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, as well as open-source VLMs such as LLaVA-Video, we find significant performance gaps of up to 32% from humans on these tasks. Our findings reveal key limitations in current VLMs, emphasizing the need for enhanced model architectures and training strategies. Our data and leaderboard is available at blackswan.cs.ubc.ca",

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

These fabricated videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head generation techniques. Code: https://github.com/yuangan/Silencer",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding framework for real-world image dehazing, abbreviated as IPC-Dehaze, which leverages the high-quality codebook prior encapsulated in a pre-trained VQGAN. Apart from previous codebook-based methods that rely on one-shot decoding, our method utilizes high-quality codes obtained in the previous iteration to guide the prediction of the Code-Predictor in the subsequent iteration, improving code prediction accuracy and ensuring stable dehazing performance. Our idea stems from the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze density and scene depth, and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring dense haze regions. However, it is nontrivial to progressively refine the obtained codes in subsequent iterations, owing to the difficulty in determining which codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key insight of our study is to propose Code-Critic to capture interrelations among codes. The Code-Critic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample a set of codes with the highest mask scores, i.e., a higher score indicates that the code is more likely to be rejected, which helps retain more accurate codes and predict difficult ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing. Our code will be made publicly available",

The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surface-based analytical shading models do not apply.

We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Using parts of existing models to rebuild new models, commonly termed as example-based modeling, is a classical methodology in the realm of computer graphics. Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs, which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this, we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task, selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images, PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

In this paper we observe that the initial iterations of model training play a key role in domain generalization effectiveness, since the loss landscape may be significantly different across the training and test distributions, contrary to the case of i.i.d. data. Conflicts between gradients of the loss components of each domain lead the optimization procedure to undesirable local minima that do not capture the domain-invariant features of the target classes. We propose alleviating domain conflicts in model optimization, by iteratively annealing the parameters of a model in the early stages of training and searching for points where gradients align between domains. By discovering a set of parameter values where gradients are updated towards the same direction for each data distribution present in the training set, the proposed Gradient-Guided Annealing (GGA) algorithm encourages models to seek out minima that exhibit improved robustness against domain shifts. The efficacy of GGA is evaluated on five widely accepted and challenging image classification domain generalization benchmarks, where its use alone is able to establish highly competitive or even state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Scientific research demands sophisticated reasoning over multimodal data, a challenge especially prevalent in biology. Despite recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for AI-assisted research, existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks only target up to college-level difficulty, while research-level benchmarks emphasize lower-level perception, falling short of the complex multimodal reasoning needed for scientific discovery. To bridge this gap, we introduce MicroVQA, a visual-question answering (VQA) benchmark designed to assess three reasoning capabilities vital in research workflows: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. MicroVQA consists of 1,042 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) curated by biology experts across diverse microscopy modalities, ensuring VQA samples represent real scientific practice. In constructing the benchmark, we find that standard MCQ generation methods induce language shortcuts, motivating a new two-stage pipeline: an optimized LLM prompt structures question-answer pairs into MCQs; then, an agent-based 'RefineBot' updates them to remove shortcuts. Benchmarking on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a peak performance of 53%; models with smaller LLMs only slightly underperform top models, suggesting that language-based reasoning is less challenging than multimodal reasoning; and tuning with scientific articles enhances performance. Expert analysis of chain-of-thought responses shows that perception errors are the most frequent, followed by knowledge errors and then overgeneralization errors. These insights highlight the challenges in multimodal scientific reasoning, showing MicroVQA is a valuable resource advancing AI-driven biomedical research.

Although remarkable progress has been made in video generation models, generative inbetweening still faces challenges in maintaining temporal stability due to the ambiguous interpolation path between two key frames. This issue becomes particularly severe when there is a large motion gap between input frames. In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet highly effective Frame-wise Conditions-driven Video Generation (FCVG) method that significantly enhances the temporal stability of interpolated video frames. Specifically, our FCVG provides an explicit condition for each frame, making it much easier to identify the interpolation path between two input frames and thus ensuring temporally stable production of visually plausible video frames. To achieve this, we suggest extracting matched lines from two input frames that can then be easily interpolated frame by frame, serving as frame-wise conditions seamlessly integrated into existing video generation models. In extensive evaluations covering diverse scenarios such as natural landscapes, complex human poses, camera movements and animations, existing methods often exhibit incoherent transitions across frames. In contrast, our FCVG demonstrates the capability to generate temporally stable videos using both linear and non-linear interpolation curves.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image models have simplified creating high-fidelity images, but preserving the identity (ID) of specific elements, like a personal dog, is still challenging.Object customization, using reference images and textual descriptions, is key to addressing this issue. Current object customization methods are either object-specific, requiring extensive fine-tuning, or object-agnostic, offering zero-shot customization but limited to specialized domains. The primary issue of promoting zero-shot object customization from specific domains to the general domain is to establish a large-scale general ID dataset for model pre-training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to construct a large dataset of general objects and build the Multi-Category ID-Consistent (MC-IDC) dataset, featuring 315k text-image samples across 10k categories. With the help of MC-IDC, we introduce Customizing Anything (CustAny), a zero-shot framework that maintains ID fidelity and supports flexible text editing for general objects. CustAny features three key components: a general ID extraction module, a dual-level ID injection module, and an ID-aware decoupling module, allowing it to customize any object from a single reference image and text prompt. Experiments demonstrate that CustAny outperforms existing methods in both general object customization and specialized domains like human customization and virtual try-on. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset, the CustAny framework and novel ID processing to advance this field. The official project page is in https://lingjiekong-fdu.github.io",

Furthermore, we design a hierarchical feature unfolding structure to enhance VLU-Net framework, efficiently synthesizing degradation patterns across various levels.VLU-Net is the first all-in-one DUN framework and outperforms current leading one-by-one and all-in-one end-to-end methods by 3.74 dB on the SOTS dehazing dataset and 1.70 dB on the Rain100L deraining dataset",

However, how to further enhance 3D LMMs to achieve fine-grained scene understanding and facilitate flexible human-agent interaction remains a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce 3D-LLaVA, a simple yet highly powerful 3D LMM designed to act as an intelligent assistant in comprehending, reasoning, and interacting with the 3D world. Unlike existing top-performing methods that rely on complicated pipelines--such as offline multi-view feature extraction or additional task-specific heads--3D-LLaVA adopts a minimalist design with integrated architecture and only takes point clouds as input. At the core of 3D-LLaVA is a new Omni Superpoint Transformer (OST), which integrates three functionalities: (1) a visual feature selector that converts and selects visual tokens, (2) a visual prompt encoder that embeds interactive visual prompts into the visual token space, and (3) a referring mask decoder that produces 3D masks based on text description. This versatile OST is empowered by the hybrid pretraining to obtain perception priors and leveraged as the visual connector that bridges the 3D data to the LLM. After performing unified instruction tuning, our 3D-LLaVA reports impressive results on various benchmarks. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/djiajunustc/3D-LLaVA",

However, in 3D scene understanding, self-supervised methods are typically only used as a weight initialization step for task-specific fine-tuning, limiting their utility for general-purpose feature extraction. This paper aims to address this shortcoming by proposing a robust evaluation protocol specifically designed to assess the quality of self-supervised features for 3D scene understanding. Our protocol uses multi-resolution feature sampling of hierarchical models to create rich point-level representations that capture the semantic capabilities of the model and, hence, are suitable for evaluation with linear probing and nearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, we introduce the first self-supervised model that performs similarly to supervised models when only off-the-shelf features are used in a linear probing setup. In particular, our model is trained natively in 3D with a novel self-supervised approach based on a Masked Scene Modeling objective, which reconstructs deep features of masked patches in a bottom-up manner and is specifically tailored to hierarchical 3D models.

Since depth images can provide extra information other than RGB images to help segment these problematic areas, depth-assisted polyp segmentation has gained much attention. However, the utilization of depth information is still worth studying. The existing RGB-D segmentation methods rely on depth data in the inference stage, limiting their clinical applications. To tackle this problem, we propose a semi-supervised polyp segmentation framework based on the mean teacher architecture. We establish an auxiliary student network with depth images as input in the training stage, and we propose a depth-guided cross-modal mutual learning strategy to promote the learning of complementary information between different student networks. Meanwhile, we use the high-confidence pseudo-labels generated by the auxiliary student network to guide the learning progress of the main student network from different perspectives. Our model does not need depth data in the inference phase. In addition, we introduce a depth-guided patch augmentation method to improve the model's learning performance in difficult regions of unlabeled polyp images.

Comprehensive testing shows that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions.

However, in real-world surveillance contexts, data is distributed across multiple devices/entities, raising privacy and ownership concerns that make existing centralized training impractical for VI-ReID. To tackle these challenges, we propose L2RW, a benchmark that brings VI-ReID closer to real-world applications. The rationale of L2RW is that integrating decentralized training into VI-ReID can address privacy concerns in scenarios with limited data-sharing regulation. Specifically, we design protocols and corresponding algorithms for different privacy sensitivity levels. In our new benchmark, we ensure the model training is done in the conditions that: 1) data from each camera remains completely isolated, or 2) different data entities (e.g., data controllers of a certain region) can selectively share the data. In this way, we simulate scenarios with strict privacy constraints which is closer to real-world conditions. Intensive experiments with various server-side federated algorithms are conducted, showing the feasibility of decentralized VI-ReID training. Notably, when evaluated in unseen domains (i.e., new data entities), our L2RW, trained with isolated data (privacy-preserved), achieves performance comparable to SOTAs trained with shared data (privacy-unrestricted).

In contrast, our approach leverages neural implicit representation (NIR) to enable free-topology changing shape deformation. Unlike previous mesh-based methods, which model learns vertex-based deformation fields, our method learns a continuous velocity field in Euclidean space, making it suitable for less structured data such as point clouds.Additionally, our method does not require intermediate-shape supervision during training; instead, we incorporate physical and geometrical constraints to regularize the velocity field. We reconstruct intermediate surfaces using a modified level-set equation, directly linking our NIR with the velocity field.

Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7%, 31.6%, and 20.1% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 50.7% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Coordinated audio generation based on video inputs typically requires a strict audio-visual (AV) alignment, where both semantics and rhythmics of the generated audio segments shall correspond to those in the video frames. Previous studies leverage a two-stage design where the AV encoders are firstly aligned via contrastive learning, then the encoded video representations guide the audio generation process. We observe that both contrastive learning and global video guidance are effective in aligning overall AV semantics while limiting temporally rhythmic synchronization. In this work, we propose Foley-Flow to first align unimodal AV encoders via masked modeling training, where the masked audio segments are recovered under the guidance of the corresponding video segments. After training, the AV encoders which are separately pretrained using only unimodal data are aligned with semantic and rhythmic consistency. Then, we develop a dynamic conditional flow for the final audio generation. Built upon the efficient velocity flow generation framework, our dynamic conditional flow utilizes temporally varying video features as the dynamic condition to guide corresponding audio segment generations. To this end, we extract coherent semantic and rhythmic representations during masked AV alignment, and use this representation of video segments to guide audio generation temporally. Our audio results are evaluated on the standard benchmarks and largely surpass existing results under several metrics. The superior performance indicates that Foley-Flow is effective in generating coordinated audios that are both semantically and rhythmically coherent to various video sequences",

To enhance responses determination accuracy and handle higher frame-rate inputs efficiently, we employ Token Aggregation Routing to dynamically fuse spatiotemporal features without increasing token numbers, while utilizing Token Dropping Routing to eliminate redundant features, and **2) Slow Path: Multi-granularity Keyframe Augmentation** optimizes keyframes during response generation. To provide comprehensive and detailed responses beyond atomic actions constrained by training data, fine-grained spatial features and human-environment interaction features are extracted through multi-granular pooling.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recently, large efforts have been made to design efficient linear-complexity visual Transformers. However, current linear attention models are generally unsuitable to be deployed in resource-constrained mobile devices, due to suffering from either few efficiency gains or significant accuracy drops. In this paper, we propose a new deCoupled duAl-interactive lineaR attEntion (CARE) mechanism, revealing that features' decoupling and interaction can fully unleash the power of linear attention. We first propose an asymmetrical feature decoupling strategy that asymmetrically decouples the learning process for local inductive bias and long-range dependencies, thereby preserving sufficient local and global information while effectively enhancing the efficiency of models. Then, a dynamic memory unit is employed to maintain critical information along the network pipeline. Moreover, we design a dual interaction module to effectively facilitate interaction between local inductive bias and long-range information as well as among features at different layers. By adopting a decoupled learning way and fully exploiting complementarity across features, our method can achieve both high efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO, and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., achieving 78.4/82.1% top-1 accuracy on ImagegNet-1K at the cost of only 0.7/1.9 GMACs.

    "abstract": "Image editing has advanced significantly with the introduction of text-conditioned diffusion models. Despite this progress, seamlessly adding objects to images based on textual instructions without requiring user-provided input masks remains a challenge. We address this by leveraging the insight that removing objects (Inpaint) is significantly simpler than its inverse process of adding them (Paint), attributed to inpainting models that benefit from segmentation mask guidance. Capitalizing on this realization, by implementing an automated and extensive pipeline, we curate a filtered large-scale image dataset containing pairs of images and their corresponding object-removed versions. Using these pairs, we train a diffusion model to inverse the inpainting process, effectively adding objects into images. Unlike other editing datasets, ours features natural target images instead of synthetic ones while ensuring source-target consistency by construction. Additionally, we utilize a large Vision-Language Model to provide detailed descriptions of the removed objects and a Large Language Model to convert these descriptions into diverse, natural-language instructions. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that the trained model surpasses existing models in both object addition and general editing tasks.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However, existing application strategies are straightforward, utilizing only the final output of the pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary information in the intermediate layer, thereby failing to fully unlock the potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation, we propose an orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA), which constructs an ordered feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba to fuse all complementary semantics, thereby promoting comprehensive point cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore, we further propose a geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different layers, which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order, thus enabling more effective integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing diverse complementary intermediate features.

In addition to enhancing auto-focus performance, QPD sensors also enable disparity estimation in horizontal and vertical directions.

Furthermore, effectively utilizing the two-directional disparity of QPD sensors remains a challenge. The scarcity of QPD disparity datasets also limits the development of learning-based methods. In this work, we address these challenges by first proposing a DPNet for DP disparity estimation. Specifically, we design an illumination-invariant module to reduce the impact of illumination, followed by a coarse-to-fine module to estimate sub-pixel disparity. Building upon the DPNet, we further propose a QuadNet, which integrates the two-directional disparity via an edge-aware fusion module. To facilitate the evaluation of our approaches, we propose the first QPD disparity dataset QPD2K, comprising 2,100 real-world QPD images and corresponding disparity maps.

To enable splatting-based rasterization, a linear transformation is learned to project each high-dimensional Gaussian back to the 3D space, which is sufficient to capture expression variations instead of using complex neural networks. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive densification strategy that dynamically allocates Gaussians to regions with high expression variance, improving the facial detail representation.

In this work, we propose CAV-MAE Sync as a simple yet effective extension of the original CAV-MAE framework for self-supervised audio-visual learning.

Third, we improve spatial localization by introducing learnable register tokens that reduce semantic load on patch tokens.

However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains.This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images.Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360deg synthesis",

    "abstract": "Object permanence in humans is a fundamental cue that helps in understanding persistence of objects, even when they are fully occluded in the scene. Present day methods in object segmentation do not account for this amodal nature of the world, and only work for segmentation of visible or modal objects. Few amodal methods exist; single-image segmentation methods cannot handle high-levels of occlusions which are better inferred using temporal information, and multi-frame methods have focused solely on segmenting rigid objects. To this end, we propose to tackle video amodal segmentation by formulating it as a conditional generation task, thereby capitalizing on the foundational knowledge in video generative models. Our method is simple; we repurpose these models to condition on a sequence of modal mask frames of an object along with contextual depth maps, to learn which object boundary may be occluded and therefore, extended to hallucinate the complete extent of an object. This is followed by a content completion stage which is able to inpaint the occluded regions of an object. We benchmark our approach alongside a wide array of state-of-the-art methods on four datasets and show a dramatic improvement of upto 13% for amodal segmentation in an object's occluded region",

    "abstract": "Retrieval augmentation, the practice of retrieving additional data from large auxiliary pools, has emerged as an effective technique for enhancing model performance in the low-data regime. Prior approaches have employed only nearest-neighbor based strategies for data selection, which retrieve auxiliary samples with high similarity to instances in the target task. However, these approaches are prone to selecting highly redundant samples, since they fail to incorporate any notion of diversity. In our work, we first demonstrate that data selection strategies used in prior retrieval-augmented few-shot adaptation settings can be generalized using a class of functions known as Combinatorial Mutual Information (CMI) measures. We then propose COBRA (COmBinatorial Retrieval Augmentation), which employs an alternative CMI measure that considers both diversity and similarity to a target dataset. COBRA consistently outperforms previous retrieval approaches across image classification tasks and few-shot learning techniques when used to retrieve samples from LAION-2B. COBRA introduces negligible computational overhead to the cost of retrieval while providing significant gains in downstream model performance",

However, existing methods for monocular hand reconstruction typically rely on a weak perspective camera model, which simulates hand motion within a limited camera frustum.

Instead of standard pixels, PPA sensors consist of thousands of \"pixel-processors\", enabling massive parallel computation of visual data at the point of light capture. Our approach performs all computation entirely in-pixel, meaning no raw image data need ever leave the sensor for external processing. We introduce a Descriptor-In-Pixel paradigm, in which a feature descriptor is held within the memory of each pixel-processor. The PPA's architecture enables the response of every processor's descriptor, upon the current image, to be computed in parallel. This produces a \"descriptor response map\", which, by generating the correct layout of descriptors across the pixel-processors, can be used for both point-feature detection and tracking. This reduces sensor output to just sparse feature locations and descriptors, read-out via an address-event interface, giving a greater than 1000X reduction in data transfer compared to raw image output. The sparse readout and complete utilization of all pixel-processors makes our approach very efficient. Our implementation upon the SCAMP-7 PPA prototype runs at over 3000 FPS (Frames Per Second), tracking point-features reliably under violent motion. This is the first work performing point-feature detection and tracking entirely in-pixel",

    "abstract": "Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide an interpretable framework for neural networks by mapping visual features to predefined, human-understandable concepts. However, the application of CBMs is often constrained by insufficient concept annotations. Recently, multi-modal pre-trained models have shown promise in reducing annotation costs by aligning visual representations with textual concept embeddings. Nevertheless, the quality and completeness of the predefined concepts significantly affect the performance of CBMs.In this work, we propose Hybrid Concept Bottleneck Model (HybridCBM), a novel CBM framework to address the challenge of incomplete predefined concepts. Our method consists of two main components: a Static Concept Bank and a Dynamic Concept Bank. The Static Concept Bank directly leverages large language models (LLMs) for concept construction, while the Dynamic Concept Bank employs learnable vectors to capture complementary and valuable concepts continuously during training. After training, a pre-trained translator converts these vectors into human-understandable concepts, further enhancing model interpretability. Notably, HybridCBM is highly flexible and can be easily applied to any CBM to improve performance. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that HybridCBM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable results to black-box models. Additionally, we propose novel metrics to evaluate the quality of the learned concepts, showing that they perform comparably to predefined concepts",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network.The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial",

    "abstract": "Domain-Incremental Learning (DIL) involves the progressive adaptation of a model to new concepts across different domains. While recent advances in pre-trained models provide a solid foundation for DIL, learning new concepts often results in the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge. Specifically, sequential model updates can overwrite both the representation and the classifier with knowledge from the latest domain. Thus, it is crucial to develop a representation and corresponding classifier that accommodate all seen domains throughout the learning process. To this end, we propose DUal ConsolidaTion (Duct) to unify and consolidate historical knowledge at both the representation and classifier levels. By merging the backbone of different stages, we create a representation space suitable for multiple domains incrementally. The merged representation serves as a balanced intermediary that captures task-specific features from all seen domains. Additionally, to address the mismatch between consolidated embeddings and the classifier, we introduce an extra classifier consolidation process. Leveraging class-wise semantic information, we estimate the classifier weights of old domains within the latest embedding space. By merging historical and estimated classifiers, we align them with the consolidated embedding space, facilitating incremental classification. Extensive experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate Duct's state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/Estrella-fugaz/CVPR25-Duct",

To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality.

Extensive experimental results on both OPV2V and DairV2X datasets show that our framework, despite its sparsity, outperforms the state of the art with less communication bandwidth requirements. In addition, experiments on the OPV2Vt and DairV2Xt datasets for time-aligned cooperative object detection also show a significant performance gain compared to the baseline works",

    "abstract": "Video generation assessment is essential for ensuring that generative models produce visually realistic, high-quality videos while aligning with human expectations. Current video generation benchmarks fall into two main categories: traditional benchmarks, which use metrics and embeddings to evaluate generated video quality across multiple dimensions but often lack alignment with human judgments; and large language model (LLM)-based benchmarks, though capable of human-like reasoning, are constrained by a limited understanding of video quality metrics and cross-modal consistency.To address these challenges and establish a benchmark that better aligns with human preferences, this paper introduces Video-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark featuring a rich prompt suite and extensive evaluation dimensions. This benchmark represents the first attempt to systematically leverage MLLMs across all dimensions relevant to video generation assessment in generative models. By incorporating few-shot scoring and chain-of-query techniques, Video-Bench provides a structured, scalable approach to generated video evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that MLLMs achieve superior alignment with human preferences across all dimensions. Moreover, in instances where our framework's assessments diverge from human evaluations, it consistently offers more objective and accurate insights, suggesting an even greater potential advantage over traditional human judgment",

Several studies have evaluated the possibility of promoting SG through the proposal of novel architectures, loss functions, or training methodologies. Few studies, however, have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end, we study three different properties. First, data diversity, instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second, burstiness, where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third, latent intervention, where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy",

To push the limits of this paradigm, we propose MergeVQ, which incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based generative models to bridge the gap between image generation and visual representation learning in a unified architecture. During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from latent space with the token merge module after self-attention blocks in the encoder for subsequent Look-up Free Quantization (LFQ) and global alignment and recovers their fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. As for second-stage generation, we introduce MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction. Extensive experiments on ImageNet verify that MergeVQ as an AR generative model achieves competitive performance in both visual representation learning and image generation tasks while maintaining favorable token efficiency and inference speed.

To mitigate this requirement, existing methods jointly optimize camera poses and NeRF often relying on good pose initialisation or depth priors. However, these approaches struggle in challenging scenarios, such as large rotations, as they map each camera to a world coordinate system. We propose a novel method that eliminates prior dependencies by modeling continuous camera motions as time-dependent angular velocity and velocity. Relative motions between cameras are learned first via velocity integration, while camera poses can be obtained by aggregating such relative motions up to a world coordinate system defined at a single time step within the video. Specifically, accurate continuous camera movements are learned through a time-dependent NeRF, which captures local scene geometry and motion by training from neighboring frames for each time step. The learned motions enable fine-tuning the NeRF to represent the full scene geometry. Experiments on Co3D and Scannet show our approach achieves superior camera pose and depth estimation and comparable novel-view synthesis performance compared to state-of-the-art methods",

We introduce InterMimic, a framework that enables a single policy to robustly learn from hours of imperfect MoCap data covering diverse full-body interactions with dynamic and varied objects. Our key insight is to employ a curriculum strategy -- perfect first, then scale up. We first train subject-specific teacher policies to mimic, retarget, and refine motion capture data. Next, we distill these teachers into a student policy, with the teachers acting as online experts providing direct supervision, as well as high-quality references. Notably, we incorporate RL fine-tuning on the student policy to surpass mere demonstration replication and achieve higher-quality solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that InterMimic produces realistic and diverse interactions across multiple HOI datasets.

However, we observe that fixed hyperparameters -- such as intra-layer positions, layer depth, and scaling factors, can considerably hinder PEFT performance, as fine-tuning on RS images proves highly sensitive to these settings. To address this, we propose MetaPEFT, a method incorporating adaptive scalers that dynamically adjust module influence during fine-tuning. MetaPEFT dynamically adjusts three key factors of PEFT on RS images: module insertion, layer selection, and module-wise learning rates, which collectively control the influence of PEFT modules across the network. We conduct extensive experiments on three transfer-learning scenarios and five datasets in both RS and natural image domains.

Inspired by this, we introduce a sensitivity-guided channel pruning strategy that quantifies each channel based on its sensitivity to domain discrepancies at both image and instance levels. We apply weighted sparsity regularization to selectively suppress and prune these sensitive channels, focusing adaptation efforts on invariant ones. Additionally, we introduce a stochastic channel reactivation mechanism to restore pruned channels, enabling recovery of potentially useful features and mitigating the risks of early pruning.

Through systematic evaluation, we find that while DINO and iBOT outperform MAE across visuomotor control and perception tasks, they struggle when trained on non-(single-)object-centric (NOC) data--a limitation strongly correlated with their diminished ability to learn object-centric representations. This investigation indicates that the ability to form object-centric representations from the non-object-centric robotics dataset is the key to success for PVMs. Motivated by this discovery, we designed SlotMIM, a method that induces object-centric representations by introducing a semantic bottleneck to reduce the number of prototypes to encourage the emergence of objectness as well as cross-view consistency regularization for encouraging multiview invariance. Our experiments encompass pre-training on object-centric, scene-centric, web-crawled, and ego-centric data. Across all settings, our approach learns transferrable representations and achieves significant improvements over prior work in image recognition, scene understanding, and robot learning evaluations.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Going beyond few-shot action recognition (FSAR), cross-domain FSAR (CDFSAR) has attracted recent research interests by solving the domain gap lying in source-to-target transfer learning. Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However, such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First, pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones, which incurs heavy computation cost, especially for large source and small target data. Second, pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner, hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations, this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline, namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically, our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data, which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain, our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN), whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly, TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models, enabling efficient adaptation to target domains. Furthermore, GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations, improving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely used video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed counterparts by 13% 31%, achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results",

    "abstract": "Change detection (CD) holds significant implications for Earth observation, in which pseudo-changes between bitemporal images induced by imaging environmental factors are key challenges. Existing methods mainly regard pseudo-changes as a kind of style shift and alleviate it by transforming bitemporal images into the same style using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Nevertheless, their efforts are limited by the complexity of optimizing GANs and the absence of guidance from physical properties. This paper finds that the spectrum transformation (ST) has the potential to mitigate pseudo-changes by aligning in the frequency domain carrying the style. However, the benefit of ST is largely constrained by two drawbacks: 1) limited transformation space and 2) inefficient parameter search. To address these limitations, we propose a Feature Spectrum learning (FeaSpect) that adaptively eliminate pseudo-changes in the latent space. For the drawback 1), FeaSpect directs the transformation towards style-aligned discriminative features via feature spectrum transformation (FST). For the drawback 2), FeaSpect allows FST to be trainable, efficiently discovering optimal parameters via extraction box with adaptive attention and extraction box with learnable strides. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method remarkably outperforms existing methods and achieves a commendable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Importantly, our method can be easily injected into other frameworks, achieving consistent improvements",

    "abstract": "Closed-loop simulation is essential for advancing end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Contemporary sensor simulation methods, such as NeRF and 3DGS, rely predominantly on conditions closely aligned with training data distributions, which are largely confined to forward-driving scenarios. Consequently, these methods face limitations when rendering complex maneuvers (e.g., lane change, acceleration, deceleration). Recent advancements in autonomous-driving world models have demonstrated the potential to generate diverse driving videos. However, these approaches remain constrained to 2D video generation, inherently lacking the spatiotemporal coherence required to capture intricacies of dynamic driving environments.In this paper, we introduce DriveDreamer4D, which enhances 4D driving scene representation leveraging world model priors. Specifically, we utilize the world model as a data machine to synthesize novel trajectory videos, where structured conditions are explicitly leveraged to control the spatial-temporal consistency of traffic elements. Besides, the cousin data training strategy is proposed to facilitate merging real and synthetic data for optimizing 4DGS. To our knowledge, DriveDreamer4D is the first to utilize video generation models for improving 4D reconstruction in driving scenarios.Experimental results reveal that DriveDreamer4D significantly enhances generation quality under novel trajectory views, achieving a relative improvement in FID by 32.1%, 46.4%, and 16.3% compared to PVG, S3Gaussian, and Deformable-GS. Moreover, DriveDreamer4D markedly enhances the spatiotemporal coherence of driving agents, which is verified by a comprehensive user study and the relative increases of 22.6%, 43.5%, and 15.6% in the NTA-IoU metric",

These methods are prone to over-fitting in downstream tasks, due to the difference in data scale and distribution. To address this issue, we propose a new adapter-based PEFT module, i.e., LoKi, which consists of an encoder, a learnable activation layer, and a decoder. To maintain the simplicity of LoKi, we use single-layer linear networks for the encoder and decoder, and for the learnable activation layer, we use a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with the minimal number of layers (only 2 KAN linear layers). With a bottleneck rate much lower than that of Adapter, LoKi is equipped with fewer parameters (only half of Adapter) and eliminates slow training speed and high memory usage of KAN. We conduct extensive experiments on LoKi under image classification and video action recognition across 9 datasets. LoKi demonstrates highly competitive generalization performance compared to other PEFT methods with fewer tunable parameters, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "As an important part of intelligent manufacturing, pixel-level surface defect detection (SDD) aims to locate defect areas through mask prediction. Previous methods adopt the image-independent static convolution to indiscriminately classify per-pixel features for mask prediction, which leads to suboptimal results for some challenging scenes such as weak defects and cluttered backgrounds. In this paper, inspired by query-based methods, we propose a Wavelet and Prototype Augmented Query-based Transformer (WPFormer) for surface defect detection. Specifically, a set of dynamic queries for mask prediction is updated through the dual-domain transformer decoder. Firstly, a Wavelet-enhanced Cross-Attention (WCA) is proposed, which aggregates meaningful high- and low-frequency information of image features in the wavelet domain to refine queries. WCA enhances the representation of high-frequency components by capturing multi-scale relationships between different frequency components, enabling queries to focus more on defect details. Secondly, a Prototype-guided Cross-Attention (PCA) is proposed to refine queries through meta-prototypes in the spatial domain. The prototypes aggregate semantically meaningful tokens from image features, facilitating queries to aggregate crucial defect information under the cluttered backgrounds. Extensive experiments on three defect detection datasets (i.e., ESDIs-SOD, CrackSeg9k, and ZJU-Leaper) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in defect detection.

In particular, using regression loss functions based on Gaussian distributions has become attractive since they yield simple and differentiable terms. However, existing solutions are still based on regression heads that produce Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs), and the known problem of angular boundary discontinuity persists. In this work, we propose a regression head for OOD that directly produces Gaussian distributions based on the Cholesky matrix decomposition. The proposed head, named Gaucho, theoretically mitigates the boundary discontinuity problem and is fully compatible with recent Gaussian-based regression loss functions. Furthermore, we advocate using Oriented Ellipses (OEs) to represent oriented objects, which relates to GauCho through a bijective function and alleviates the encoding ambiguity problem for circular objects. Our experimental results show that GauCho can be a viable alternative to the traditional OBB head, achieving results comparable to or better than state-of-the-art detectors for the challenging dataset DOTA",

In typical driving scenes, \"things\" categories can be dynamic and associated with higher collision risks, making them crucial for safe navigation and planning. Recognizing the importance of \"things\" categories, we identify their performance drop as a serious bottleneck in existing approaches. We observed that adverse weather induces degradation of semantic-level features and both corruption of local features, leading to a misprediction of \"things\" as \"stuff\". To mitigate these corruptions, we suggests our method, NTN - segmeNt Things for No-accident. To address semantic-level feature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing the misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories. Additionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse weather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a regularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart in feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU gain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the SemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark.

In this paper, we propose a framework that detects if an adversarial noise instance is being generated. Unlike existing stateful defenses that detect adversarial noise generation by monitoring the input space, our approach learns adversarial patterns in the input update similarity space. In fact, we propose to observe a new metric called Delta Similarity (DS), which we show it captures more efficiently the adversarial behavior.We evaluate our approach against 8 state-of-the-art attacks, including adaptive attacks, where the adversary is aware of the defense and tries to evade detection.

    "abstract": "The orientation of surface normals in 3D point cloud is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Determining a globally consistent orientation solely from the point cloud is however challenging due to the global scope of the problem and the discrete nature of point cloud, particularly in the presence of noise, outliers, holes, thin structures, and complex topologies. This paper presents an efficient, robust, and global algorithm for generating consistent normal orientation of a dense 3D point cloud. The basic idea is to transform the original binary normal orientation problem to finding a relaxed sign field on a Delaunay graph, which can be achieved by solving a sparse linear system. The Delaunay graph is constructed by triangulating a level set of an implicit function defined from the input point cloud. The shape diameter function is estimated to serve as a prior for determining an appropriate level value such that the level set implicitly defines the inner and outer shells enclosing the input point clouds. As such, our algorithm leverages the strengths of the shape diameter function, Delaunay triangulation, and the least-square techniques, making the underlying processes take both geometry and topology into consideration, and thus provides an efficient and robust solution for handling point clouds with complicated geometry and topology. Extensive experiments on various shapes with noise and outliers confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm",

To incorporate sequential inputs, most existing methods fuse representations from previous frames to infer the current 3D occupancy.

In this paper, we propose a world-modelbased framework to exploit the scene evolution for perception. We reformulate 3D occupancy prediction as a 4D occupancy forecasting problem conditioned on the current sensor input. We decompose the scene evolution into three factors: 1) ego motion alignment of static scenes; 2) local movements of dynamic objects; and 3) completion of newly-observed scenes. We then employ a Gaussian world model (GaussianWorld) to explicitly exploit these priors and infer the scene evolution in the 3D Gaussian space considering the current RGB observation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework on the widely used nuScenes dataset.

Meanwhile, pruning methods that do not require fine-tuning perform well at low sparsity levels (10%-50%) but struggle at mid-to-high sparsity levels (50%-70%), where the error behaves equivalently to that of semi-structured pruning. To address these issues, this paper introduces ICP, which finds a balance between full fine-tuning and zero fine-tuning. First, Sparsity Rearrange is used to reorganize the predefined sparsity levels, followed by Block-wise Compensate Pruning, which alternates pruning and compensation on the model's backbone, fully utilizing inference results while avoiding full model fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "In this research, we propose a novel denoising diffusion model based on shortest-path modeling that optimizes residual propagation to enhance both denoising efficiency and quality. Drawing on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and insights from graph theory, our model, termed the Shortest Path Diffusion Model (ShortDF), treats the denoising process as a shortest-path problem aimed at minimizing reconstruction error. By optimizing the initial residuals, we improve the efficiency of the reverse diffusion process and the quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that ShortDF significantly reduces diffusion time (or steps) while enhancing the visual fidelity of generated samples compared to prior methods. This work, we suppose, paves the way for interactive diffusion-based applications and establishes a foundation for rapid data generation. Code is available at https://github.com/UnicomAI/ShortDF",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results across various cross-modal tasks. However, hallucinations, i.e., the models generating counterfactual responses, remain a challenge. Though recent studies have attempted to alleviate object perception hallucinations, they focus on the models' response generation, and overlook the task question itself. This paper discusses the vulnerability of LVLMs in solving counterfactual presupposition questions (CPQs), where the models are prone to accept the presuppositions of counterfactual objects and produce severe hallucinatory responses. To this end, we introduce \"Antidote\", a unified, synthetic data-driven post-training framework for mitigating both types of hallucination above. It leverages synthetic data to incorporate factual priors into questions to achieve self-correction, and decouples the mitigation process into a preference optimization problem. Furthermore, we construct \"CP-Bench\", a novel benchmark to evaluate LVLMs' ability to correctly handle CPQs and produce factual responses. Applied to the LLaVA series, Antidote can simultaneously enhance performance on CP-Bench by over 50%, POPE by 1.8-3.3%, and CHAIR & SHR by 30-50%, all without relying on external supervision from stronger LVLMs or human feedback and without introducing noticeable catastrophic forgetting issues",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Long-term sports assessment is a challenging task in video understanding since it requires judging complex movement variations and action-music coordination. However, there is no direct correlation between the diverse background music and movements in sporting events. Previous works require a large number of model parameters to learn potential associations between actions and music. To address this issue, we propose a language-guided audio-visual learning (MLAVL) framework that models \"audio-action-visual\" correlations guided by low-cost language modality. In our framework, multidimensional domain-based actions form action knowledge graphs, motivating audio-visual modalities to focus on task-relevant actions. We further design a shared-specific context encoder to integrate deep multimodal semantics, and an audio-visual cross-modal fusion module to evaluate action-music consistency. To match the sport's rules, we then propose a dual-branch prompt-guided grading module to weigh both visual and audio-visual performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on four public long-term sports benchmarks while maintaining low parameters.

The existing methods fail to capture the non-linear relationship between task accuracy and model confidence, particularly in the context of overconfidence. This can limit the model's learning opportunities for high entropy samples that significantly influence a model's generalization ability. To solve this, we propose a novel gradient pass-based DPL technique that incorporates the high-entropy samples, which are typically overlooked. Our approach introduces two classifiers--low gradient pass (LGP) and high gradient pass (HGP)--to derive over- and under-confident dynamic thresholds that indicate the class-wise overconfidence acceleration, respectively. By combining the under- and over-confident states from the GP classifiers, we create a more adaptive and accurate PL method. Our main contributions highlight the importance of considering both low and high-confidence samples in enhancing the model's robustness and generalization for improved PL performance",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enhanced the performance of text-to-image models in image synthesis. To enable control over the the spatial locations of the generated objects,diffusion-based methods typically utilizeobject layout as an auxiliary input. However, we observe that this approach treats all objects as being on the same layer and neglect their visibility order, leading to the synthesis of overlapping objects with incorrect occlusions.To address this limitation, we introduce in this paper a new training-free framework that considers object visibility order explicitly and allows users to place overlapping objects in a stack of layers. Our framework consists of two visibility-based designs. First, we propose a novel Sequential Denoising Process (SDP) to divide the whole image generation into multiple stages for different objects, each stage primarily focuses on an object. Second, we propose a novel Visibility-Order-Aware (VOA) Loss to transform the layout and occlusion constraints into an attention map optimization process to improve the accuracy of synthesizing object occlusions in complex scenes. By merging these two novel components, our framework, dubbed VODiff, enables the generation of photorealistic images that satisfy user-specified spatial constraints and object occlusion relationships. In addition, we introduce VOBench, a diverse benchmark dataset containing 200 curated samples, each with a reference image, text prompts, object visibility orders and layout maps. We conduct extensive evaluations on this dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our approach",

While these tasks have traditionally been modeled separately, we argue that they can benefit from joint learning in a multi-task framework. To this end, we propose WeakMCN, a novel multi-task collaborative network that effectively combines WREC and WRES with a dual-branch architecture. Specifically, the WREC branch is formulated as anchor-based contrastive learning, which also acts as a teacher to supervise the WRES branch. In WeakMCN, we propose two innovative designs to facilitate multi-task collaboration, namely Dynamic Visual Feature Enhancement (DVFE) and Collaborative Consistency Module (CCM). DVFE dynamically combines various pre-trained visual knowledge to meet different task requirements, while CCM promotes cross-task consistency from the perspective of optimization. Extensive experimental results on three popular REC and RES benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, consistently demonstrate performance gains of WeakMCN over state-of-the-art single-task alternatives, e.g., up to 3.91% and 13.11% on RefCOCO for WREC and WRES tasks, respectively. Furthermore, experiments also validate the strong generalization ability of WeakMCN in both semi-supervised REC and RES settings against existing methods, e.g., +8.94% for semi-REC and +7.71% for semi-RES on 1% RefCOCO",

This study investigates the generation of parametric sequences for computer-aided design (CAD) models using LLMs. This endeavor represents an initial step towards creating parametric 3D shapes with LLMs, as CAD model parameters directly correlate with shapes in three-dimensional space. Despite the formidable generative capacities of LLMs, this task remains challenging, as these models neither encounter parametric sequences during their pretraining phase nor possess direct awareness of 3D structures. To address this, we present CAD-Llama, a framework designed to enhance pretrained LLMs for generating parametric 3D CAD models. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical annotation pipeline and a code-like format to translate parametric 3D CAD command sequences into Structured Parametric CAD Code (SPCC), incorporating hierarchical semantic descriptions. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive pretraining approach utilizing SPCC, followed by an instruction tuning process aligned with CAD-specific guidelines. This methodology aims to equip LLMs with the spatial knowledge inherent in parametric sequences.

To address this gap, we propose 4DGC, a novel rate-aware 4D Gaussian compression framework that significantly reduces storage size while maintaining superior RD performance for FVV. Specifically, 4DGC introduces a motion-aware dynamic Gaussian representation that utilizes a compact motion grid combined with sparse compensated Gaussians to exploit inter-frame similarities. This representation effectively handles large motions, preserving quality and reducing temporal redundancy. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end compression scheme that employs differentiable quantization and a tiny implicit entropy model to compress the motion grid and compensated Gaussians efficiently.

Some typical works in literature attempt to translate the synthetic images with object pose labels generated by object CAD models into the real domain, and then use the translated data for training. However, their performance is generally limited, since (i) there still exists a domain gap between the translated images and the real images and (ii) the translated images can not sufficiently reflect occlusions that exist in many real images. To address these problems, we propose an Occlusion-Aware Neural Domain Adaptation method for self-supervised 6D object Pose estimation, called ONDA-Pose. The proposed method comprises three main steps. Firstly, by utilizing both the training real images without pose labels and a CAD model, we explore a CAD-like radiance field for rendering corresponding synthetic images that have similar textures to those generated by the CAD model. Then, a backbone pose estimator trained on the synthetic data is employed to provide initial pose estimations for the synthetic images rendered from the CAD-like radiance field, and the initial object poses are refined by a global object pose refiner to generate pseudo object pose labels. Finally, the backbone pose estimator is further self-supervised as the final pose estimator by jointly utilizing the real images with pseudo object pose labels and the synthetic images rendered from the CAD-like radiance field. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that ONDA-Pose significantly outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art methods in most cases",

Beyond the challenge of lengthy animation times, a critical challenge in realistic talking head generation lies in preserving the natural movement of diverse body parts. To this end, we propose Teller, the first streaming audio-driven protrait animation framework with autoregressive motion generation. Specifically, Teller first decomposes facial and body detail animation into two components: Facial Motion Latent Generation (FMLG) based on an autoregressive transfromer, and movement authenticity refinement using a Efficient Temporal Module (ETM).Concretely, FMLG employs a Residual VQ model to map the facial motion latent from the implicit keypoint-based model into discrete motion tokens, which are then temporally sliced with audio embeddings. This enables the AR tranformer to learn real-time, stream-based mappings from audio to motion.Furthermore, Teller incorporate ETM to capture finer motion details. This module ensures the physical consistency of body parts and accessories, such as neck muscles and earrings, improving the realism of these movements.Teller is designed to be efficient, surpassing the inference speed of diffusion-based models (Hallo 20.93s vs. Teller 0.92s for one second video generation), and achieves a real-time streaming performance of up to 25 FPS.

Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or videoand fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360^\\circ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application.

While Test-time Training (TTT) approaches show promise for this task, they suffer from two significant limitations. Existing TTT works are primarily designed for classification tasks rather than continuous value regression, and they lack mechanisms to handle the quasi-periodic nature of cardiac signals. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Quasi-Periodic Adaptive Regression with Test-time Training (Q-PART) framework. In the training stage, the proposed Quasi-Period Network decomposes the echocardiogram into periodic and aperiodic components within latent space by combining parameterized helix trajectories with Neural Controlled Differential Equations. During inference, our framework further employs a variance minimization strategy across image augmentations that simulate common quality issues in echocardiogram acquisition, along with differential adaptation rates for periodic and aperiodic components. Theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate that our variance minimization objective effectively bounds the regression error under mild conditions. Furthermore, extensive experiments across three pediatric age groups demonstrate that Q-PART not only significantly outperforms existing approaches in pediatric LVEF prediction, but also exhibits strong clinical screening capability with high mAUROC scores (up to 0.9747) and maintains gender-fair performance across all metrics, validating its robustness and practical utility in pediatric echocardiography analysis",

To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines",

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios.In this paper, we introduce CarPlanner, a Consistent auto-regressive Planner that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance.Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving.To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent text-to-3D generation models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in producing high-quality 3D assets. Despite their great advancements, current models struggle to generate satisfying 3D objects with complex attributes. The difficulty for such complex attributes 3D generation arises from two aspects: (1) existing text-to-3D approaches typically lift text-to-image models to extract semantics via text encoders, while the text encoder exhibits limited comprehension ability for long descriptions, leading to deviated cross-attention focus, subsequently wrong attribute binding in generated results. (2) Objects with complex attributes often exhibit occlusion relationships between different parts, which demands a reasonable generation order as well as explicit disentanglement of different parts to enable structural coherent and attribute following results. Though some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues, their quality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above problems, we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation (HCoG). It leverages a large language model to analyze the long description, decomposes it into several blocks representing different object parts, and organizes an optimal generation order from in to out according to the occlusion relationship between parts, turning the whole generation process into a hierarchical chain. For optimization within each block, we first generate the necessary components coarsely, then bind their attributes precisely by target region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization. For optimization between blocks, we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to seamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels, re-assigning semantic labels, and eliminating unnecessary kernels, ensuring that only relevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts. Experiments validate HCoG's effectiveness in handling complex attributes 3D assets and witnesses high-quality results. The code is available at https://github.com/Wakals/GASCOL",

Our method introduces a novel Spatio-Temporal Alignment Block (STAB) that directly processes video inputs without requiring pre-trained encoders while using only 45M parameters for visual processing - at least a 6.5x reduction compared to traditional approaches.

Our model achieves comparable or superior performance to encoder-based approaches for open-ended video question answering on standard benchmarks. The fine-grained video question-answering evaluation demonstrates our model's effectiveness, outperforming the encoder-based approaches Video-ChatGPT and Video-LLaVA in key aspects like correctness and temporal understanding.

Existing work has essentially focused on isolating camouflaged objects from the environment, demonstrating ever-improving performance but at the cost of extensive annotations and complex optimizations. In this paper, we diverge from this paradigm and shift the lens to isolating the salient environment from the camouflaged object. We introduce EASE, an Environment-Aware unSupErvised COD framework that identifies the environment by referencing an environment prototype library and detects camouflaged objects by inverting the retrieved environmental features. Specifically, our approach (DiffPro) uses large multimodal models, diffusion models, and vision-foundation models to construct the environment prototype library. To retrieve environments from the library and refrain from confusing foreground and background, we incorporate three retrieval schemes: Kernel Density Estimation-based Adaptive Threshold (KDE-AT), Global-to-Local pixel-level retrieval (G2L), and Self-Retrieval (SR). Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over current unsupervised methods, with EASE achieving an average gain of over 10% on the COD10K dataset.

This paper addresses the challenge of estimating oriented point normals by introducing a point cloud normal estimation framework via hybrid angular and Euclidean distance encoding (HAE). Our method overcomes the limitations of local geometric information by combining angular and Euclidean spaces to extract features from both point cloud coordinates and light rays, leading to more accurate normal estimation. The core of our network consists of an angular distance encoding module, which leverages both ray directions and point coordinates for unoriented normal refinement, and a ray feature fusion module for normal orientation, that is robust to noise.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to bridge this gap by following a well-defined optimization paradigm which systematically looks for the best architecture, given objective criterion such as maximal classification accuracy. The main limitation of NAS is however its astronomical computational cost, as it typically requires training each candidate network architecture from scratch.In this paper, we aim to alleviate this limitation by proposing a novel training-free proxy for image classification accuracy based on Fisher Information. The proposed proxy has a strong theoretical background in statistics and it allows estimating expected image classification accuracy of a given deep network without training the network, thus significantly reducing computational cost of standard NAS algorithms. Our training-free proxy achieves state-of-the-art results on three public datasets and in two search spaces, both when evaluated using previously proposed metrics, as well as using a new metric that we propose which we demonstrate is more informative for practical NAS applications.

Although early research prioritized visual quality, preserving fine details and adapting to downstream tasks remains challenging.

To address these issues, we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to grow the quality of fusion results and enable downstream task adaptability, namely SAGE. Specifically, we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly, to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference, we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses, which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge.

To address the key technical challenges of (1) developing robust visual-audio models for egocentric data, (2) enabling identity recognition, and (3) facilitating long-context question answering over extensive temporal information, we introduce EgoButler, an integrated system comprising EgoGPT and EgoRAG. EgoGPT is an omni-modal model trained on egocentric datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on egocentric video understanding. EgoRAG is a retrieval-based component that supports answering ultra-long-context questions. Our experimental studies verify their working mechanisms and reveal critical factors and bottlenecks, guiding future improvements. By releasing our datasets, models, and benchmarks, we aim to stimulate further research in egocentric AI assistants",

    "abstract": "Reversible Adversarial Examples (RAE) are designed to protect the intellectual property of datasets. Such examples can function as imperceptible adversarial examples to erode the model performance of unauthorized users while allowing authorized users to remove the adversarial perturbations and recover the original samples for normal model training. With the rise of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), an increasing number of unlabeled datasets and pre-trained encoders are available in the community. However, existing RAE methods not only rely on well-labeled datasets for training Supervised Learning (SL) models but also exhibit poor adversarial transferability when attacking SSL pre-trained encoders. To address these challenges, we propose RAEncoder, the first framework for RAEs without the need for labeled samples. RAEncoder aims to generate universal adversarial perturbations by targeting SSL pre-trained encoders. Unlike traditional RAE approaches, the pre-trained encoder outputs the feature distribution of the protected dataset rather than classification labels, enhancing both the attack success rate and transferability of RAEs. Extensive experiments are conducted on six pre-trained encoders and four SL models, covering aspects such as imperceptibility and transferability. Our results demonstrate that RAEncoder effectively protects unlabeled datasets from malicious infringements. Additional robustness experiments further confirm the security of RAEncoder in practical application scenarios",

This difficulty arises from the parametric nature of B-rep data, complicating the encoding and generation of its geometric and topological information. To address this, we introduce BrepGiff, a lightweight generation approach for high-quality and complex B-rep model based on 3D Graph Diffusion. First, we transfer B-rep models into 3D graphs representation. Specifically, BrepGiff extracts and integrates topological and geometric features to construct a 3D graph where nodes correspond to face centroids in 3D space, preserving adjacency and degree information. Geometric features are derived by sampling points in the UV domain and extracting face and edge features. Then, BrepGiff applies a Graph Attention Network (GAT) to enforce topological constraints from local to global during the degree-guided diffusion process. With the 3D graph representation and efficient diffusion process, our method significantly reduces the computational cost and improves the quality, thus achieving lightweight generation of complex models. Experiments show that BrepGiff can generate complex B-rep models (>100 faces) using only 2 RTX4090 GPUs, achieving state-of-the-art performance in B-rep generation",

Our approach yields explainable counterfactuals in a non-generative manner by quantifying similarity and weighting component contributions within regions of interest between correctly classified and misclassified samples.

Unlike existing methods that typically require pre-defined 3D models or specific training datasets as priors, which limit their applicability, our method is free from these constraints. Our method consists of a geometry generation module and a pose optimization module. Its core idea is to enable these two modules to automatically and iteratively enhance each other, thereby gradually building all the necessary information for the tracking task. We thus call the method as Bidirectional Iterative Tracking(BIT). The geometry generation module starts without priors and gradually generates high-precision mesh models for tracking, while the pose optimization module generates additional data during object tracking to further refine the generated models. Moreover, the generated 3D models can be stored and easily reused, allowing for seamless integration into various other tracking systems, not just our methods. Experimental results demonstrate that BIT outperforms many existing methods, even those that extensively utilize prior knowledge, while BIT does not rely on such information. Additionally, the generated 3D models deliver results comparable to actual 3D models, highlighting their superior and innovative qualities.

Existing correspondence refinement methods mostly follow the paradigm of outlier removal, which either fails to correctly identify the accurate correspondences under extreme outlier ratios, or select too few correct correspondences to support robust registration. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach named Regor, which is a progressive correspondence regenerator that generates higher-quality matches whist sufficiently robust for numerous outliers. In each iteration, we first apply prior-guided local grouping and generalized mutual matching to generate the local region correspondences. A powerful center-aware three-point consistency is then presented to achieve local correspondence correction, instead of removal. Further, we employ global correspondence refinement to obtain accurate correspondences from a global perspective. Through progressive iterations, this process yields a large number of high-quality correspondences. Extensive experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that the proposed Regor significantly outperforms existing outlier removal techniques. More critically, our approach obtain 10 times more correct correspondences than outlier removal methods. As a result, our method is able to achieve robust registration even with weak features.

While relatively underexplored, automatic chaptering has the potential to enable efficient navigation and content retrieval in long-form videos. In this paper, we achieve strong chaptering performance on hour-long videos by efficiently addressing the problem in the text domain with our \"Chapter-Llama\" framework. Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained large language model (LLM) with large context window, and feed as input (i) speech transcripts and (ii) captions describing video frames, along with their respective timestamps. Given the inefficiency of exhaustively captioning all frames, we propose a lightweight speech-guided frame selection strategy based on speech transcript content, and experimentally demonstrate remarkable advantages. We train the LLM to output timestamps for the chapter boundaries, as well as free-form chapter titles. This simple yet powerful approach scales to processing one-hour long videos in a single forward pass.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Decompositional reconstruction of 3D scenes, with complete shapes and detailed texture of all objects within, is intriguing for downstream applications but remains challenging, particularly with sparse views as input. Recent approaches incorporate semantic or geometric regularization to address this issue, but they suffer significant degradation in underconstrained areas and fail to recover occluded regions. We argue that the key to solving this problem lies in supplementing missing information for these areas. To this end, we propose DP-Recon, which employs diffusion priors in the form of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize the neural representation of each individual object under novel views. This provides additional information for the underconstrained areas, but directly incorporating diffusion prior raises potential conflicts between the reconstruction and generative guidance. Therefore, we further introduce a visibility-guided approach to dynamically adjust the per-pixel SDS loss weights. Together these components enhance both geometry and appearance recovery while remaining faithful to input images. Extensive experiments across Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it achieves better object reconstruction under 10 views than the baselines under 100 views. Our method enables seamless text-based editing for geometry and appearance through SDS optimization and produces decomposed object meshes with detailed UV maps that support photorealistic Visual effects (VFX) editing.

Such a philosophy inspires us to study image-to-image (I2I) generation, where models can learn from in-the-wild images in a self-supervised manner. We first develop a pure vision-based training framework, Lumos, and confirm the feasibility and the scalability of learning I2I models. We then find that, as an upstream task of T2I, our I2I model serves as a more foundational visual prior and achieves on-par or better performance than existing T2I models using only 1/10 text-image pairs for fine-tuning.

In this paper, we propose several solvers to estimate both rotational and translational velocities within a unified framework. Our method leverages event manifolds induced by line segments. The problem formulations are based on either an incidence relation for lines or a novel coplanarity relation for normal vectors. We demonstrate the possibility of recovering full-DoF egomotion parameters for both angular and linear velocities without requiring extra sensor measurements or motion priors.

Recent methods address these limitations by tracing the particles instead, but, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally, we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods, enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods have shown promising performance in linguistic quality description. However, current methods still fall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work, we aim to leverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships. Moreover, to address dataset variation, where different IQA datasets exhibit various distributions, we introduce a fidelity loss based on Thurstone's model. This loss captures intra-dataset relationships, facilitating co-training across multiple IQA datasets. With these designs, we develop the distribution-based Depicted image Quality Assessment model for Score regression (DeQA-Score). Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DeQA-Score stably outperforms baselines in score regression. Also, DeQA-Score can predict the score distribution that closely aligns with human annotations. Codes and model weights have been released in https://depictqa.github.io/deqa-score/",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) improve performance on vision-language tasks by integrating visual features from pre-trained vision encoders into large language models (LLMs). However, how MLLMs process and utilize visual information remains unclear. In this paper, a shift in the dominant flow of visual information is uncovered: (1) in shallow layers, strong interactions are observed between image tokens and instruction tokens, where most visual information is injected into instruction tokens to form cross-modal semantic representations; (2) in deeper layers, image tokens primarily interact with each other, aggregating the remaining visual information to optimize semantic representations within the visual modality. Based on these insights, we propose Hierarchical Modality-Aware Pruning (HiMAP), a plug-and-play inference acceleration method that dynamically prunes image tokens at specific layers, reducing computational costs by approximately 65% without sacrificing performance. Our findings offer a new understanding of visual information processing in MLLMs and provide a state-of-the-art solution for efficient inference",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have experienced significant progress and are quantized for deployment in resource-constrained applications. Quantized models are vulnerable to targeted bit-flip attacks (BFAs). A targeted BFA prepares a trigger and a corresponding Trojan/backdoor, inserting the latter (with RowHammer bit flipping) into a victim model, to mislead its classification on samples containing the trigger. Existing targeted BFAs on quantized ViTs are limited in that: (1) they require numerous bit-flips, and (2) the separation between flipped bits is below 4 KB, making attacks infeasible with RowHammer in real-world scenarios. We propose a new and practical targeted attack Flip-S against quantized ViTs. The core insight is that in quantized models, a scale factor change ripples through a batch of model weights. Consequently, flipping bits in scale factors, rather than solely in model weights, enables more cost-effective attacks. We design a Scale-Factor-Search (SFS) algorithm to identify critical bits in scale factors for flipping, and adopt a mutual exclusion strategy to guarantee a 4 KB separation between flips. We evaluate Flip-S on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets across five ViT architectures and two quantization levels. Results show that Flip-S achieves attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90.0% on all models with 50 bits flipped, outperforming baselines with ASR typically below 80.0%. Furthermore, compared to the SOTA, Flip-S reduces the number of required bit-flips by 8x-20xwhile reaching equal or higher ASR. Our source code is publicly available",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a novel dimension to document understanding, i.e., they endow large language models with visual comprehension capabilities; however, how to design a suitable image-text pre-training task for bridging the visual and language modality in document-level MLLMs remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a novel visual-language alignment method that casts the key issue as a Visual Question Answering with Mask generation (VQAMask) task, optimizing two tasks simultaneously: VQA-based text parsing and mask generation. The former allows the model to implicitly align images and text at the semantic level. The latter introduces an additional mask generator (discarded during inference) to explicitly ensure alignment between visual texts within images and their corresponding image regions at a spatially-aware level. Together, they can prevent model hallucinations when parsing visual text and effectively promote spatially-aware feature representation learning. To support the proposed VQAMask task, we construct a comprehensive image-mask generation pipeline and provide a large-scale dataset with 6M data (MTMask6M). Subsequently, we demonstrate that introducing the proposed mask generation task yields competitive document-level understanding performance. Leveraging the proposed VQAMask, we introduce Marten, a training-efficient MLLM tailored for document-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our Marten consistently achieves significant improvements among 8B-MLLMs in document-centric tasks.

    "abstract": "Similar to Vision Transformers, this paper identifies artifacts also present within the feature maps of Vision Mamba. These artifacts, corresponding to high-norm tokens emerging in low-information background areas of images, appear much more severe in Vision Mamba---they exist prevalently even with the tiny-sized model and activate extensively across background regions. To mitigate this issue, we follow the prior solution of introducing register tokens into Vision Mamba. To better cope with Mamba blocks' uni-directional inference paradigm, two key modifications are introduced: 1) evenly inserting registers throughout the input token sequence, and 2) recycling registers for final decision predictions. We term this new architecture MambaReg. Qualitative observations suggest, compared to vanilla Vision Mamba, MambaReg's feature maps appear cleaner and more focused on semantically meaningful regions. Quantitatively, MambaReg attains stronger performance and scales better. For example, on the ImageNet benchmark, our MambaReg-B attains 83.0% accuracy, significantly outperforming Vim-B's 81.8%; furthermore, we provide the first successful scaling to the large model size (i.e., with 340M parameters), attaining a competitive accuracy of 83.6% (84.5% if finetuned with 384x384 inputs).

We present the first feasibility study, and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised, or \"blind\", matching. First, we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems, for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second, we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances, vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free. As a proof of concept, we showcase an unsupervised classifier, which achieves non-trivial classification accuracy without any image-text annotation",

Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K--a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs.

We design SOGS, an anchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve superior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size simultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order statistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within each anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering quality effectively.

Most existing methods leverage dense grid-based scene representations, overlooking the spatial sparsity of the driving scenes, which leads to computational redundancy. Although 3D semantic Gaussian serves as an object-centric sparse alternative, most of the Gaussians still describe the empty region with low efficiency. To address this, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian superposition model which interprets each Gaussian as a probability distribution of its neighborhood being occupied and conforms to probabilistic multiplication to derive the overall geometry. Furthermore, we adopt the exact Gaussian mixture model for semantics calculation to avoid unnecessary overlapping of Gaussians. To effectively initialize Gaussians in non-empty region, we design a distribution-based initialization module which learns the pixel-aligned occupancy distribution instead of the depth of surfaces.

    "abstract": "Diffusion prior-based methods have shown impressive results in real-world image super-resolution (SR). However, most existing methods entangle pixel-level and semantic-level SR objectives in the training process, struggling to balance pixel-wise fidelity and perceptual quality. Meanwhile, users have varying preferences on SR results, thus it is demanded to develop an adjustable SR model that can be tailored to different fidelity-perception preferences during inference without re-training. We present Pixel-level and Semantic-level Adjustable SR (PiSA-SR), which learns two LoRA modules upon the pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model to achieve improved and adjustable SR results. We first formulate the SD-based SR problem as learning the residual between the low-quality input and the high-quality output, then show that the learning objective can be decoupled into two distinct LoRA weight spaces: one is characterized by the l2-loss for pixel-level regression, and another is characterized by the LPIPS and classifier score distillation losses to extract semantic information from pre-trained classification and SD models. In its default setting, PiSA-SR can be performed in a single diffusion step, achieving leading real-world SR results in both quality and efficiency. By introducing two adjustable guidance scales on the two LoRA modules to control the strengths of pixel-wise fidelity and semantic-level details during inference, PiSA-SR can offer flexible SR results according to user preference without re-training.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfying performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spuriousfeatures based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spuriousfeatures by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation.

    "abstract": "Multi-view object tracking (MVOT) offers promising solutions to challenges such as occlusion and target loss, which are common in traditional single-view tracking. However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive multi-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome these limitations, we compiled a Multi-View object Tracking (MVTrack) dataset of 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across various scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT method, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate multi-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can track any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints. The key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come from two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature volume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating inter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that leverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the tracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the MVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance",

To address this, we propose AirRoom, an object-aware pipeline that integrates multi-level object-oriented information--from global context to object patches, object segmentation, and keypoints--utilizing a coarse-to-fine retrieval approach. Extensive experiments on four newly constructed datasets--MPReID, HMReID, GibsonReID, and ReplicaReID--demonstrate that AirRoom outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across nearly all evaluation metrics, with improvements ranging from 6% to 80%.

While prior works demonstrated that VLMs organize natural language representations into regular structures encoding composite meanings, it remains unclear if compositional patterns also emerge in the visual embedding space. In this work, we investigate compositionality in the image domain, where the analysis of compositional properties is challenged by noise and sparsity of visual data. We address these problems and propose a framework, called Geodesically Decomposable Embeddings (GDE), that approximates image representations with geometry-aware compositional structures in the latent space. We demonstrate that visual embeddings of pre-trained VLMs exhibit a compositional arrangement, and evaluate the effectiveness of this property in the tasks of compositional classification and group robustness. GDE achieves stronger performance in compositional classification compared to its counterpart method that assumes linear geometry of the latent space. Notably, it is particularly effective for group robustness, where we achieve higher results than task-specific solutions. Our results indicate that VLMs can automatically develop a human-like form of compositional reasoning in the visual domain, making their underlying processes more interpretable.

To address this issue, we proposed a novel visual foundation model called DefMamba.

    "abstract": "Co-speech gestures are crucial non-verbal cues that enhance speech clarity and expressiveness in human communication, which have attracted increasing attention in multimodal research. While the existing methods have made strides in gesture accuracy, challenges remain in generating diverse and coherent gestures, as most approaches assume independence among multimodal inputs and lack explicit modeling of their interactions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning method named HOP for co-speech gesture generation that captures the heterogeneous entanglement between gesture motion, audio rhythm, and text semantics, enabling the generation of coordinated gestures. By leveraging spatiotemporal graph modeling, we achieve the alignment of audio and action. Moreover, to enhance modality coherence, we build the audio-text semantic representation based on a reprogramming module, which is beneficial for cross-modality adaptation. Our approach enables the trimodal system to learn each other's features and represent them in the form of topological entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering more natural and expressive co-speech gesture generation.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in camera-based occupancy prediction have focused on the simultaneous prediction of 3D semantics and scene flow, a task that presents significant challenges due to specific difficulties, e.g., occlusions and unbalanced dynamic environments. In this paper, we analyze these challenges and their underlying causes. To address them, we propose a novel regularization framework called VoxelSplat. This framework leverages recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting to enhance model performance in two key ways: (i)Enhanced Semantics Supervision through 2D Projection: During training, our method decodes sparse semantic 3D Gaussians from 3D representations and projects them onto the 2D camera view. This provides additional supervision signals in the camera-visible space, allowing 2D labels to improve the learning of 3D semantics. (ii) Scene Flow Learning: Our framework uses the predicted scene flow to model the motion of Gaussians, and is thus able to learn the scene flow of moving objects in a self-supervised manner using the labels of adjacent frames. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into various existing occupancy models, enhancingperformance without increasing inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelSplat in improving the accuracy of both semantic occupancy and scene flow estimation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper explores scene affinity (AIScene), namely intra-scene consistency and inter-scene correlation, for semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation in driving scenes. Adopting teacher-student training, AIScene employs a teacher network to generate pseudo-labeled scenes from unlabeled data, which then supervise the student network's learning. Unlike most methods that include all points in pseudo-labeled scenes for forward propagation but only pseudo-labeled points for backpropagation, AIScene removes points without pseudo-labels, ensuring consistency in both forward and backward propagation within the scene. This simple point erasure strategy effectively prevents unsupervised, semantically ambiguous points (excluded in backpropagation) from affecting the learning of pseudo-labeled points. Moreover, AIScene incorporates patch-based data augmentation, mixing multiple scenes at both scene and instance levels. Compared to existing augmentation techniques that typically perform scene-level mixing between two scenes, our method enhances the semantic diversity of labeled (or pseudo-labeled) scenes, thereby improving the semi-supervised performance of segmentation models. Experiments show that AIScene outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks across four settings, achieving notable improvements of 1.9% and 2.1% in the most challenging 1% labeled data.

To enhance control precision, control mixer module encodes the correlated features between the target-aligned control and reference-aligned control, and a novel guidance method, reference control guidance, steers the generation process for better control adherence.

Minority instances, in the context of T2I generation, can be defined as ones living on low-density regions of text-conditional data distributions. They are valuable for various applications of modern T2I generators, such as data augmentation and creative AI. Unfortunately, existing pretrained T2I diffusion models primarily focus on high-density regions, largely due to the influence of guided samplers (like CFG) that are essential for high-quality generation. To address this, we present a novel framework to counter the high-density-focus of T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we first develop an online prompt optimization framework that encourages emergence of desired properties during inference while preserving semantic contents of user-provided prompts. We subsequently tailor this generic prompt optimizer into a specialized solver that promotes generation of minority features by incorporating a carefully-crafted likelihood objective. Extensive experiments conducted across various types of T2I models demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the capability to produce high-quality minority instances compared to existing samplers.

    "abstract": "In incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC), missing data induce prototype shifts within views and semantic inconsistencies across views. A feasible solution is to explore cross-view consistency in paired complete observations, further imputing and aligning the similarity relationships inherently shared across views. Nevertheless, existing methods are constrained by two-tiered limitations: (1) Neither instance- nor cluster-level consistency learning construct a semantic space shared across views to learn consensus semantics. The former enforces cross-view instances alignment, and wrongly regards unpaired observations with semantic consistency as negative pairs; the latter focuses on cross-view cluster counterparts while coarsely handling fine-grained intra-cluster relationships within views. (2) Excessive reliance on consistency results in unreliable imputation and alignment without incorporating view-specific cluster information. Thus, we propose an IMVC framework, imputation- and alignment-free for consensus semantics learning (FreeCSL). To bridge semantic gaps across all observations, we learn consensus prototypes from available data to discover a shared space, where semantically similar observations are pulled closer for consensus semantics learning. To capture semantic relationships within specific views, we design a heuristic graph clustering based on modularity to recover cluster structure with intra-cluster compactness and inter-cluster separation for cluster semantics enhancement.

Recently, sensitivity-aware parameter efficient fine-tuning method (SPT) addresses this problem by identifying sensitive parameters and then leveraging its sparse characteristic to combine unstructured and structured tuning for PEFT. However, existing methods only focus on sparse characteristic of sensitive parameters but overlook its distribution characteristic, which results in additional storage burden and limited performance improvement. In this paper, we find that the distribution of sensitive parameters is not chaotic, but concentrates in a small number of rows or columns in each parameter matrix. Inspired by this fact, we propose a Compact Dynamic-Rank Adaptation-based tuning method for Sensitivity-aware Parameter efficient fine-Tuning, called CDRA-SPT. Specifically, we first identify the sensitive parameters that require tuning for each downstream task. Then, we reorganize the sensitive parameters by following its row and column into a compact sub-parameter matrix. Finally, a dynamic-rank adaptation is designed and applied at sub-parameter matrix level for PEFT.

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and the representation of complex real-world motions. To address these challenges, we propose MoDec-GS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed to reconstruct novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce Global-to-Local Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarse-to-fine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), which extend static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes, including anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, enabling MoDec-GS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDec-GS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over state-of-the-art methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from real-world dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality",

We attribute the issue of lengthy optimization to the stochastic optimization scheme used in SDS-based editing, where many steps may conflict with each other (e.g., the inherent trade-off between editing and preservation). To reduce this internal conflict and speed up the editing process, we propose to separate editing and preservation in time with a diffusion time schedule and frame the 3D editing optimization process as a diffusion bridge sampling process. Motivated by the analysis above, we introduce DaCapo, a fast diffusion sampling-like 3D editing method that incorporates a novel stacked bridge framework, which estimates a direct diffusion bridge between source and target distribution with only a pretrained 2D diffusion model. Specifically, It models the editing process as a combination of inversion and generation, where both processes happen simultaneously as a stack of Diffusion Bridges.

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral fusion imaging is challenged by high computational cost due to the abundant spectral information. We find that pixels in regions with smooth spatial-spectral structure can be reconstructed well using a shallow network, while only those in regions with complex spatial-spectral structure require a deeper network. However, existing methods process all pixels uniformly, which ignores this property. To leverage this property, we propose a Selective Re-learning Fusion Network (SRLF) that initially extracts features from all pixels uniformly and then selectively refines distorted feature points. Specifically, SRLF first employs a Preliminary Fusion Module with robust global modeling capability to generate a preliminary fusion feature. Afterward, it applies a Selective Re-learning Module to focus on improving distorted feature points in the preliminary fusion feature. To achieve targeted learning, we present a novel Spatial-Spectral Structure-Guided Selective Re-learning Mechanism (SSG-SRL) that integrates the observation model to identify the feature points with spatial or spectral distortions. Only these distorted points are sent to the corresponding re-learning blocks, reducing both computational cost and the risk of overfitting. Finally, we develop an SRLF-Net, composed of multiple cascaded SRLFs, which surpasses multiple state-of-the-art methods on several datasets with minimal computational cost",

    "abstract": "Pixel-level segmentation of structural cracks across various scenarios remains a considerable challenge. Current methods encounter challenges in effectively modeling crack morphology and texture, facing challenges in balancing segmentation quality with low computational resource usage. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight Structure-Aware Vision Mamba Network (SCSegamba), capable of generating high-quality pixel-level segmentation maps by leveraging both the morphological information and texture cues of crack pixels with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we developed a Structure-Aware Visual State Space module (SAVSS), which incorporates a lightweight Gated Bottleneck Convolution (GBC) and a Structure-Aware Scanning Strategy (SASS). The key insight of GBC lies in its effectiveness in modeling the morphological information of cracks, while the SASS enhances the perception of crack topology and texture by strengthening the continuity of semantic information between crack pixels. Experiments on crack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving the highest performance with only 2.8M parameters.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in visual object tracking have shifted towards a sequential generation paradigm, where object deformation and motion exhibit strong temporal dependencies. Despite the importance of these dependencies, widely adopted image-level pretrained backbones barely capture the dynamics in the consecutive video, which is the essence of tracking. Thus, we propose AutoRegressive Sequential Pretraining (ARP), an unsupervised spatio-temporal learner, via generating the evolution of object appearance and motion in video sequences.Our method leverages a diffusion model to autoregressively generate the future frame appearance, conditioned on historical embeddings extracted by a general encoder. Furthermore, to ensure trajectory coherence, the same encoder is employed to learn trajectory consistency by generating coordinate sequences in a reverse autoregressive fashion, a process we term back-tracking. Further, we integrate the pretrained ARP into ARTrackV2, creating ARPTrack, which is further fine-tuned for tracking tasks. ARPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, becoming the first tracker to surpass 80% AO on GOT-10k, while maintaining high efficiency. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing temporal dependencies for continuous video tracking",

This allows Vid-LLMs to \"read\" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost.

We introduce SkillMimic, a unified data-driven framework that fundamentally changes how agents learn interaction skills by eliminating the need for skill-specific rewards. Our key insight is that a unified HOI imitation reward can effectively capture the essence of diverse interaction patterns from HOI datasets. This enables SkillMimic to learn a single policy that not only masters multiple interaction skills but also facilitates skill transitions, with both diversity and generalization improving as the HOI dataset grows. For evaluation, we collect and introduce two basketball datasets containing approximately 35 minutes of diverse basketball skills. Extensive experiments show that SkillMimic successfully masters a wide range of basketball skills including stylistic variations in dribbling, layup, and shooting. Moreover, these learned skills can be effectively composed by a high-level controller to accomplish complex and long-horizon tasks such as consecutive scoring, opening new possibilities for scalable and generalizable interaction skill learning.

Our benchmark consists of 2860 hand-picked and carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains such as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to other domains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and versatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these problems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and textual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract circuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide extensive quantitative evaluations, fine-grained analysis, and improvement methods using 17 widely-used open- and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs and 7 popular prompting techniques.

In the second stage, we refine these multi-hypothesis estimates by integrating semantic and geometric environmental constraints, ensuring that the final motion estimation aligns realistically with both the environmental context and physical interactions.Qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting significant improvements in human motion estimation within motion-environment interaction scenarios.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel problem setup termed as Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which presents unique challenges by bridging the semi-supervised learning (SSL) task and the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task, and expanding standard semi-supervised learning to cope with heterogeneous training data. At its core, HSSL aims to learn a prediction model using a combination of labeled and unlabeled training data drawn separately from heterogeneous domains that share a common set of semantic categories; this model is intended to differentiate the semantic categories of test instances sampled from both the labeled and unlabeled domains. In particular, the labeled and unlabeled domains have dissimilar label distributions and class feature distributions. This heterogeneity, coupled with the assorted sources of the test data, introduces significant challenges to standard SSL and UDA methods. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Semi-supervised Learning (Uni-HSSL), to address HSSL by directly learning a fine-grained classifier from the heterogeneous data, which adaptively handles the inter-domain heterogeneity while leveraging both the unlabeled data and the inter-domain semantic class relationships for cross-domain knowledge transfer and adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the experimental results validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed Uni-HSSL over state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation methods",

However, existing models continue to grapple with challenges such as complex training and prompt design. We introduce a new perspective for improving image restoration by injecting knowledge from pretrained vision-language models into current T2I models. We empirically show that the degradation and content representations in BLIP-2 can be linearly separated, providing promising degradation guidance for image restoration. Specifically, the Feature Difference Instruction (FDI) is first extracted by Q-Formers through a simple subtraction operation based on reference image pairs. Then, we propose a multi-scale FDI adapter to decouple the degradation style and corrupted artifacts, and inject the styleflow exclusively into specific blocks through adapter-tuning, thereby preventing noise interference and eschewing the need for cumbersome weight retraining. In this way, we can train various task-specific adapters according to different degradations, achieving rich detail enhancement in the restoration results. Furthermore, the proposed FDI adapters have attractive properties of practical value, such as composability and generalization ability for all-in-one and mixed-degradation restoration. Extensive experiments under various settings demonstrate that our method has promising repairing quality over 10 image restoration tasks and a wide range of other applications",

    "abstract": "Can we accurately identify the true correspondences from multimodal datasets containing mismatched data pairs? Existing methods primarily emphasize the similarity matching between the representations of objects across modalities, potentially neglecting the crucial relation consistency within modalities that are particularly important for distinguishing the true and false correspondences. Such an omission often runs the risk of misidentifying negatives as positives, thus leading to unanticipated performance degradation. To address this problem, we propose a general Relation Consistency learning framework, namely ReCon, to accurately discriminate the true correspondences among the multimodal data and thus effectively mitigate the adverse impact caused by mismatches. Specifically, ReCon leverages a novel relation consistency learning to ensure the dual-alignment, respectively of, the cross-modal relation consistency between different modalities and the intra-modal relation consistency within modalities. Thanks to such dual constrains on relations, ReCon significantly enhances its effectiveness for true correspondence discrimination and therefore reliably filters out the mismatched pairs to mitigate the risks of wrong supervisions. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including Flickr30K, MS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of ReCon compared with other SOTAs.

Our analysis is based on a novel amplitude-phase expansion of the sinusoidal multilayer perceptron, showing how its layer compositions produce a large number of new frequencies expressed as integer combinations of the input frequencies. This relationship can be directly used to initialize the input neurons, as a form of spectral sampling, and to bound the network's spectrum while training.

To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats.

This couples learning and generating labels on the target domain, and other recent works also leverage the generated labels to add additional domain alignment losses. We believe this coupling is brittle and excessively constrained: there is no guarantee that a student trained only on source data can generate accurate target domain labels and initiate the positive feedback loop, and much better target domain labels can likely be generated by using a large pretrained network that has been exposed to much more data. Vision foundational models are exactly such models, and they have shown impressive task generalization capabilities even when frozen. We want to leverage these models for DAOD and introduce DINO Teacher, which consists of two components. First, we train a new labeller on source data only using a large frozen DINOv2 backbone and show it generates more accurate labels than Mean Teacher.

However, its application in indoor environments remains unexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant challenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of classes, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and intra-class variances.This paper presents the first study on active learning for indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for this task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity - to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for annotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections and undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are prioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint optimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class distributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP) bank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each class, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different categories.We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2, where it outperforms baselines by a significant margin, achieving over 85% of fully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget",

    "abstract": "Clothing change person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match different images of the same person, even when the clothing varies across images. To reduce manual labeling costs, existing unsupervised CC-ReID methods employ clustering algorithms to generate pseudo-labels. However, they often fail to assign the same pseudo-label to two images with the same identity but different clothing--referred to as a clothing change positive pair--thus hindering clothing-invariant feature learning. To address this issue, we propose the identity-clothing similarity modeling (ICSM) framework. To effectively connect clothing change positive pairs, ICSM first performs clothing-aware learning to leverage all discriminative information, including clothing, to obtain compact clusters. It then extracts cluster-level identity and clothing features and performs inter-cluster similarity estimation to identify clothing change positive clusters, reliable negative clusters, and hard negative clusters for each compact cluster. During optimization, we design an adaptive version of existing optimization methods to enhance similarities of clothing change positive pairs, while also introducing text semantics as a supervisory signal to further promote clothing invariance. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over existing unsupervised methods and its competitiveness with some supervised approaches",

    "abstract": "Image matching for both cross-view and cross-modality plays a critical role in multimodal perception. In practice, the modality gap caused by different imaging systems/styles poses great challenges to the matching task. Existing works try to extract invariant features for specific modalities and train on limited datasets, showing poor generalization. In this paper, we present MINIMA, a unified image matching framework for multiple cross-modal cases. Without pursuing fancy modules, our MINIMA aims to enhance universal performance from the perspective of data scaling up. For such purpose, we propose a simple yet effective data engine that can freely produce a large dataset containing multiple modalities, rich scenarios, and accurate matching labels. Specifically, we scale up the modalities from cheap but rich RGB-only matching data, by means of generative models. Under this setting, the matching labels and rich diversity of the RGB dataset are well inherited by the generated multimodal data. Benefiting from this, we construct MD-syn, a new comprehensive dataset that fills the data gap for general multimodal image matching. With MD-syn, we can directly train any advanced matching pipeline on randomly selected modality pairs to obtain cross-modal ability. Extensive experiments on in-domain and zero-shot matching tasks, including 19 cross-modal cases, demonstrate that our MINIMA can significantly outperform the baselines and even surpass modality-specific methods.

However, transformer-based networks are notorious for their quadratic computation complexity, seriously undermining their efficacy and deployment in semantic occupancy prediction. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first Mamba-based network for semantic occupancy prediction, termed OccMamba. Specifically, we first design the hierarchical Mamba module and local context processor to better aggregate global and local contextual information, respectively. Besides, to relieve the inherent domain gap between the linguistic and 3D domains, we present a simple yet effective 3D-to-1D reordering scheme, i.e., height-prioritized 2D Hilbert expansion. It can maximally retain the spatial structure of 3D voxels as well as facilitate the processing of Mamba blocks. Endowed with the aforementioned designs, our OccMamba is capable of directly and efficiently processing large volumes of dense scene grids, achieving state-of-the-art performance across three prevalent occupancy prediction benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, SemanticKITTI, and SemanticPOSS. Notably, on OpenOccupancy, our OccMamba outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Co-Occ by 5.1% IoU and 4.3% mIoU, respectively.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-task few-shot 2D gaze estimation approach, aiming to adapt a pre-trained 3D gaze estimation network for 2D gaze prediction on unseen devices using only a few training images. This task is highly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze, unknown screen poses, and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework contains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable parameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The framework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze networks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images, which is particularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome this, we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space, where flipping is performed. Notably, this 3D space is not aligned with the camera coordinate system, so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to compensate for this misalignment. We evaluate our method on MPIIGaze, EVE, and GazeCapture datasets, collected respectively on laptops, desktop computers, and mobile devices. The superior performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach, and demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications",

Existing approaches typically employ neural networks to extract discriminative features, ranking gallery images based on their similarities to probe images.

However, current re-ranking methods mostly rely on k-nearest neighbor search to extract similar images that might have the same identity as the query, which is time-consuming with a high computation burden, limiting their applications in reality. We rethink the effect of the k-nearest neighbor search and introduce the Chebyshev's Theorem-guided Graph Re-ranking (Cheb-GR) method, which adopts the adaptive neighbor search guided by Chebyshev's Theorem over the k-nearest neighbor search for efficient neighbor selection. Our method leverages graph convolution operations to refine image features and achieve robust re-ranking, leading to enhanced retrieval performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis based on Chebyshev's Inequality to elucidate the factors contributing to the strong performance of the proposed method. Our method significantly reduces the computation costs while maintaining relatively strong performance.

    "abstract": "To capture individual gait patterns, excluding identity-irrelevant cues in walking videos, such as clothing texture and color, remains a persistent challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette and pose-based methods, though theoretically effective at removing such distractions, often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. To address this, emerging end-to-end methods focus on directly denoising RGB videos using global optimization and human-defined priors. Building on this trend, we propose a novel gait denoising method, DenosingGait. Inspired by the philosophy that \"what I cannot create, I do not understand\", we turn to generative diffusion models, uncovering how these models can partially filter out irrelevant factors for improved gait understanding. Based on this generation-driven denoising, we introduce feature matching, a kind of popular geometrical constraint in optical flow and depth estimation, to compact multi-channel float-encoded RGB information into two-channel direction vectors that represent local structural features, where within-frame matching captures spatial details and cross-frame matching conveys temporal dynamics. Experiments on the CCPG, CAISA-B*, and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within-domain and cross-domain evaluations.

In contrast to the main body of literature on conformal predictors in vision classifiers, foundation models exhibit a particular characteristic: they are pre-trained on a one-time basis on an inaccessible source domain, different from the transferred task. This domain drift negatively affects the efficiency of the conformal sets and poses additional challenges. To alleviate this issue, we propose Conf-OT, a transfer learning setting that operates transductive over the combined calibration and query sets. Solving an optimal transport problem, the proposed method bridges the domain gap between pre-training and adaptation without requiring additional data splits but still maintaining coverage guarantees. We comprehensively explore this conformal prediction strategy on a broad span of 15 datasets and three non-conformity scores.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant recognition within the deep learning community, where the fusion of the Video Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven instrumental in constructing robust video understanding systems, effectively surmounting constraints associated with predefined visual tasks. These sophisticated MLLMs exhibit remarkable proficiency in comprehending videos, swiftly attaining unprecedented performance levels across diverse benchmarks. However, their operation demands substantial memory and computational resources, underscoring the continued importance of traditional models in video comprehension tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm termed MLLM4WTAL. This paradigm harnesses the potential of MLLM to offer temporal action key semantics and complete semantic textual cues for conventional Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL) methods. MLLM4WTAL facilitates the enhancement of WTAL by leveraging MLLM guidance. It achieves this by integrating two distinct modules: Key Semantic Matching (KSM) and Complete Semantic Reconstruction (CSR). These modules work in tandem to effectively address prevalent issues like incomplete and over-complete outcomes common in WTAL methods. Rigorous experiments are conducted to validate the efficacy of our proposed approach in augmenting the performance of various heterogeneous WTAL models",

    "title": "FIMA-Q: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Transformers by Fisher Information Matrix Approximation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and promising model compression approach over recent years, as it eliminates the need for retraining on the entire dataset. Unfortunately, most existing PTQ methods for Vision Transformers (ViTs) exhibit a notable drop in accuracy, especially in low-bit cases. To tackle these challenges, we analyze the extensively utilized Hessian-guided quantization loss, and uncover certain limitations within the approximated pre-activation Hessian. Following the block-by-block reconstruction paradigm of PTQ, we first derive a quantization loss based on the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). Due to the large scale of the complete FIM, we establish the relationship between KL divergence and FIM in the PTQ scenario to enable fast computation of the quantization loss during reconstruction. Subsequently, we develop a Diagonal Plus Low-Rank (DPLR) estimation on FIM to achieve a more nuanced quantization loss. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with distinct representative ViT-based architectures on public benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization.

Furthermore, the eikonal loss suffers from stability issues in optimization. Finally, in conventional methods, regularization losses that penalize surface area distort the reconstructed signed distance function. We address these challenges by designing a loss function using the solution of a screened Poisson equation. Our loss, when minimized, provides an asymptotically sufficient condition to ensure the output converges to a true distance function. Our loss also leads to stable optimization and naturally penalizes large surface areas. We present theoretical analysis and experiments on both challenging 2D and 3D datasets and show that our method provides better surface reconstruction and a more accurate distance approximation",

In this paper, we introduce the Glia unit, composed of oligodendrocytes (Oli) and astrocytes (Ast), to emulate the exact workflow of the mammalian brain, thereby enhancing the biological plausibility of neural functions. Oli selects neurons involved in signal transmission during neural communication and, together with Ast, adaptively optimizes the neural structure. Specifically, we first construct the artificial Glia-Neuron (G-N) model, which is formulated at the instance, group, and interaction levels with adaptive and collaborative mechanisms. Then, we construct GliaNet based on our G-N model, whose structure and connections can be continuously optimized during training.

    "abstract": "Advancements in large Vision-Language Models have brought precise, accurate image captioning, vital for advancing multi-modal image understanding and processing. Yet these captions often carry lengthy, intertwined contexts that are difficult to parse and frequently overlook essential cues, posing a great barrier for models like GroundingDINO and SDXL, which lack the strong text encoding and syntax analysis needed to fully leverage dense captions.To address this, we propose BACON, a prompting method that breaks down VLM-generated captions into disentangled, structured elements such as objects, relationships, styles, and themes. This approach not only minimizes confusion from handling complex contexts but also allows for efficient transfer into a JSON dictionary, enabling models without linguistic processing capabilities to easily access key information.We annotated 100,000 image-caption pairs using BACON with GPT-4V and trained an LLaVA captioner on this dataset, enabling it to produce BACON-style captions without relying on costly GPT-4V resources. Evaluations of overall quality, precision, and recall--as well as user studies--demonstrate that the resulting caption model consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art VLM models in generating high-quality captions.Additionally, we show that BACON-style captions exhibit better clarity when applied to various models, enabling them to accomplish previously unattainable tasks or surpass existing SOTA solutions without training. For example, BACON-style captions help groundingDINO achieve 1.51 times higher recall scores on open-vocabulary object detection tasks compared to leading methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in recent years. However, the expensive inference cost limits the realistic deployment of LVLMs. Some works find that visual tokens are redundant and compress tokens to reduce the inference cost. These works identify important non-redundant tokens as target tokens, then prune the remaining tokens (non-target tokens) or merge them into target tokens. However, target token identification faces the token importance-redundancy dilemma. Besides, token merging and pruning face a dilemma between disrupting target token information and losing non-target token information. To solve these problems, we propose a novel visual token compression scheme, named Libra-Merging. In target token identification, Libra-Merging selects the most important tokens from spatially discrete intervals, achieving a more robust token importance-redundancy trade-off than relying on a hyper-parameter. In token compression, when non-target tokens are dissimilar to target tokens, Libra-Merging does not merge them into the target tokens, thus avoiding disrupting target token information. Meanwhile, Libra-Merging condenses these non-target tokens into an information compensation token to prevent losing important non-target token information. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse LVLMs, and extensive experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

The difficulty increases when aiming for finer control in the generation. To that end, prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions, thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However, the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context, we introduce MixerMDM, the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches, MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models, we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually, and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore, we propose a new evaluation technique that, for the first time in this task, measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix",

It also functions as an LDR-to-HDR converter, expanding the dynamic range of existing low-dynamic range images. Our approach uses a small HDR dataset to enable a pretrained diffusion model to recover detail and dynamic range in clipped highlights and shadows.

We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency.

    "abstract": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice question answering in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation--and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks--we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a \"gold standard\" using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis",

In this work, we propose a novel instance-aware structured caption framework, termed \\mathtt InstanceCap , to achieve instance-level and fine-grained video caption for the first time. Based on this scheme, we design an auxiliary models cluster to convert original video into instances to enhance instance fidelity. Video instances are further used to refine dense prompts into structured phrases, achieving concise yet precise descriptions. Furthermore, a 22K \\mathtt InstanceVid dataset is curated for training, and an enhancement pipeline that tailored to \\mathtt InstanceCap structure is proposed for inference.

    "abstract": "Capturing high-quality photographs under diverse real-world lighting conditions is challenging, as both natural lighting (e.g., low-light) and camera exposure settings (e.g., exposure time) significantly impact image quality. This challenge becomes more pronounced in multi-view scenarios, where variations in lighting and image signal processor (ISP) settings across viewpoints introduce photometric inconsistencies. Such lighting degradations and view-dependent variations pose substantial challenges to novel view synthesis (NVS) frameworks based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). To address this, we introduce Luminance-GS, a novel approach to achieving high-quality novel view synthesis results under diverse challenging lighting conditions using 3DGS. By adopting per-view color matrix mapping and view adaptive curve adjustments, Luminance-GS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across various lighting conditions--including low-light, overexposure, and varying exposure--while not altering the original 3DGS explicit representation. Compared to previous NeRF- and 3DGS-based baselines, Luminance-GS provides real-time rendering speed with improved reconstruction quality.

As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models, any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end, we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model, it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions, with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping, or SSS. When providing better expressivity, SSS also poses new challenges in learning. Therefore, we also propose a new principled sampling approach for optimization. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, across multiple datasets, settings, and metrics, we demonstrate that SSS outperforms existing methods in terms of quality and parameter efficiency, e.g. achieving matching or better quality with similar numbers of components, and obtaining comparable results while reducing the component number by as much as 82%",

For example, WVD can estimate XYZ frames from ground-truth RGB or generate novel RGB frames using XYZ projections along a specified camera trajectory. In doing so, WVD unifies tasks like single-image-to-3D generation, multi-view stereo, and camera-controlled video generation.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success across various multi-modal tasks, yet large VLMs encounter significant efficiency challenges due to processing numerous visual tokens. A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains performance under aggressive pruning. However, it requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce \\underline S mall VLM \\underline G uidance for \\underline L arge VLMs (SGL). Specifically, we employ the aggregated attention map from a small VLM guide the pruning of visual tokens in a large VLM. Additionally, we develop a small VLM early exiting mechanism to make full use of the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method, achieving up to 91% pruning ratio for visual tokens while retaining competitive performance",

Although intuitive, a simple amalgamation of DA and SSL is suboptimal in semantic segmentation due to two major reasons: (1) previous methods, while able to learn good segmentation boundaries, are prone to confuse classes with similar visual appearance due to limited supervision; and (2) skewed and imbalanced training data distribution preferring source representation learning whereas impeding from exploring limited information about tailed classes. Language guidance can serve as a pivotal semantic bridge, facilitating robust class discrimination and mitigating visual ambiguities by leveraging the rich semantic relationships encoded in pre-trained language models to enhance feature representations across domains.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the 3D shape of an object from a single-view image is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent advances in differentiable rendering have enabled 3D reconstruction from image collections using only 2D annotations. However, these methods mainly focus on whole-object reconstruction and overlook object partonomy, which is essential for intelligent agents interacting with physical environments. This paper aims at learning partonomic 3D reconstruction from collections of images with only 2D annotations. Our goal is not only to reconstruct the shape of an object from a single-view image but also to decompose the shape into meaningful semantic parts. To handle the expanded solution space and frequent part occlusions in single-view images, we introduce a novel approach that represents, parses, and learns the structural compositionality of 3D objects. This approach comprises: (1) a compact and expressive compositional representation of object geometry, achieved through disentangled modeling of large shape variations, constituent parts, and detailed part deformations as multi-granularity neural fields; (2) a part transformer that recovers precise partonomic geometry and handles occlusions, through effective part-to-pixel grounding and part-to-part relational modeling; and (3) a 2D-supervised learning method that jointly learns the compositional representation and part transformer, by bridging object shape and parts, image synthesis, and differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments on ShapeNetPart, PartNet, and CUB-200-2011 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both overall and partonomic reconstruction.

Our approach introduces a \"mix-and-separate\" framework with audio-visual alignment objectives that jointly learn correspondence and disentanglement using mixed audio. Through these objectives, our model learns to produce distinct embeddings for each audio type, enabling effective disentanglement and grounding across mixed audio sources.Additionally, we created a new dataset to evaluate simultaneous grounding of mixed audio sources, demonstrating that our model outperforms prior methods.

To overcome this limitation, we address a new task called structure from collision (SfC), which aims to estimate the structure (including the invisible internal one) of an object from the appearance changes at collision. To solve this task, we propose a novel model called SfC-NeRF, which optimizes the invisible internal structure of the object through a video sequence under physical, appearance (i.e., visible external structure)-preserving, and keyframe constraints. In particular, to avoid falling into undesirable local optima owing to its ill-posed nature, we propose volume annealing, i.e., searching for the global optima by repeatedly reducing and expanding the volume. Extensive experiments on 115 objects involving diverse structures (i.e., various cavity shapes, locations, and sizes) and various material properties reveal the properties of SfC and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SfC-NeRF",

    "abstract": "Recently, virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative to revolutionize histological staining by digitally generating stains. However, most existing methods suffer from the curse of staining unreality and unreliability. In this paper, we propose the Orthogonal Decoupling Alignment Generative Adversarial Network (ODA-GAN) for unpaired virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Our approach is based on the assumption that an image consists of IHC staining-related features, which influence staining distribution and intensity, and staining-unrelated features, such as tissue morphology. Leveraging a pathology foundation model, we first develop a weakly-supervised segmentation pipeline as an alternative to expert annotations. We introduce an Orthogonal MLP (O-MLP) module to project image features into an orthogonal space, decoupling them into staining-related and unrelated components. Additionally, we propose a Dual-stream PatchNCE (DPNCE) loss to resolve contrastive learning contradictions in the staining-related space, thereby enhancing staining accuracy. To further improve realism, we introduce a Multi-layer Domain Alignment (MDA) module to bridge the domain gap between generated and real IHC images.

While this is conceptually similar to Evolutionary Algorithms, their distinct objectives (selection for acceleration vs. iterative solution optimization) require a fundamental redefinition of evolutionary mechanisms for our context.In response, we design sparse fitness evaluation, frequency-guided crossover, and augmented unbiased mutation to comprise EVOS. These components respectively guide sample selection with reduced computational cost, enhance performance through frequency-domain balance, and mitigate selection bias from cached evaluation.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In recent years, numerous tasks have been proposed to encourage model to develop specified capability in understanding audio-visual scene, primarily categorized into temporal localization, spatial localization, spatio-temporal reasoning, and pixel-level understanding. Instead, human possesses a unified understanding ability for diversified tasks. Therefore, designing an audio-visual model with general capability to unify these tasks is of great value. However, simply joint training for all tasks can lead to interference due to the heterogeneity of audiovisual data and complex relationship among tasks. We argue that this problem can be solved through explicit cooperation among tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose a unified learning method which achieves explicit inter-task cooperation from both the perspectives of data and model thoroughly. Specifically, considering the labels of existing datasets are simple words, we carefully refine these datasets and construct an Audio-Visual Unified Instruction-tuning dataset with Explicit reasoning process (AV-UIE), which clarifies the cooperative relationship among tasks. Subsequently, to facilitate concrete cooperation in learning stage, an interaction-aware LoRA structure with multiple LoRA heads is designed to learn different aspects of audiovisual data interaction. By unifying the explicit cooperation across the data and model aspect, our method not only surpasses existing unified audio-visual model on multiple tasks, but also outperforms most specialized models for certain tasks. Furthermore, we also visualize the process of explicit cooperation and surprisingly find that each LoRA head has certain audio-visual understanding ability.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that large vision-language models (LVLMs) often suffer from the issue of object hallucinations (OH). To mitigate this issue, we introduce an efficient method that edits the model weights based on an unsafe subspace, which we call HalluSpace in this paper. With truthful and hallucinated text prompts accompanying the visual content as inputs, the HalluSpace can be identified by extracting the hallucinated embedding features and removing the truthful representations in LVLMs. By orthogonalizing the model weights, input features will be projected into the Null space of the HalluSpace to reduce OH, based on which we name our method Nullu. We reveal that HalluSpaces generally contain prior information in the large language models (LLMs) applied to build LVLMs, which have been shown as essential causes of OH in previous studies. Therefore, null space projection suppresses the LLMs' priors to filter out the hallucinated features, resulting in contextually accurate outputs. Experiments show that our method can effectively mitigate OH across different LVLM families without extra inference costs and also show strong performance in general LVLM benchmarks.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to develop AI-driven diagnostic systems specifically designed for multi-object oral anomaly detection, utilizing publicly available data resources.

To mitigate this memory cost, directly compressing the states can disrupt the linearity of temporal \\Delta-\\Sigma convolution, causing accumulated errors in long-term \\Delta-\\Sigma processing. Thus, we propose MEET, an optimization framework for MEmory-Efficient Temporal \\Delta-\\Sigma DNNs.

Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

However, existing federated learning systems are typically centralized, requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central server for aggregation. This centralized approach would integrate the knowledge from each client into a centralized server, and the knowledge would be already undermined during the centralized integration before it reaches back to each client. Besides, the centralized approach also creates a dependency on the central server, which may affect training stability if the server malfunctions or connections are unstable. To address these issues, we propose a decentralized federated learning framework named dFLMoE. In our framework, clients directly exchange lightweight head models with each other. After exchanging, each client treats both local and received head models as individual experts, and utilizes a client-specific Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach to make collective decisions. This design not only reduces the knowledge damage with client-specific aggregations but also removes the dependency on the central server to enhance the robustness of the framework.

We propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA) , a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates hallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images, leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are suppressed. Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit distribution that is from generative global features of the original image and discriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation, demonstrating its wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

However, their reliance on publicly available data and the growing trend of data sharing for fine-tuning make these models particularly vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In this work, we introduce the Silent Branding Attack, a novel data poisoning method that manipulates text-to-image diffusion models to generate images containing specific brand logos or symbols without any text triggers. We find that when certain visual patterns are repeatedly in the training data, the model learns to reproduce them naturally in its outputs, even without prompt mentions. Leveraging this, we develop an automated data poisoning algorithm that unobtrusively injects logos into original images, ensuring they blend naturally and remain undetected. Models trained on this poisoned dataset generate images containing logos without degrading image quality or text alignment. We experimentally validate our silent branding attack across two realistic settings on large-scale high-quality image datasets and style personalization datasets, achieving high success rates even without a specific text trigger. Human evaluation and quantitative metrics including logo detection show that our method can stealthily embed logos",

In this paper, we introduce UniSTD, a unified Transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal modeling, which is inspired by advances in recent foundation models with the two-stage pretraining-then-adaption paradigm. Specifically, our work demonstrates that task-agnostic pretraining on 2D vision and vision-text datasets can build a generalizable model foundation for spatiotemporal learning, followed by specialized joint training on spatiotemporal datasets to enhance task-specific adaptability. To improve the learning capabilities across domains, our framework employs a rank-adaptive mixture-of-expert adaptation by using fractional interpolation to relax the discrete variables so that can be optimized in the continuous space. Additionally, we introduce a temporal module to incorporate temporal dynamics explicitly. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset covering 10 tasks across 4 disciplines, demonstrating that a unified spatiotemporal model can achieve scalable, cross-task learning and support up to 10 tasks simultaneously within one model while reducing training costs in multi-domain applications.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a three-stage architecture (i.e., encoding, consensus extraction & dispersion, and prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they yield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key limitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts, thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

However, there is still a lack of effective means to manipulate 3DGS freely while maintaining rendering quality. In this work, we aim to tackle the challenge of achieving manipulable photo-realistic rendering. We propose to utilize a triangular mesh to manipulate 3DGS directly with self-adaptation. This approach reduces the need to design various algorithms for different types of 3DGS manipulation. By utilizing a triangle shape-aware Gaussian binding and adapting method, we can achieve 3DGS manipulation and preserve high-fidelity rendering. In addition, our method is also effective with inaccurate meshes extracted from 3DGS. Experiments demonstrate our method's effectiveness and superiority over baseline approaches",

Yet, existing methods are specialized, focusing on either bare-hand or hand interacting with object. No method can flexibly handle both scenarios and their performance degrades when applied to the other scenario. In this paper, we propose UniHOPE, a unified approach for general 3D hand-object pose estimation, flexibly adapting both scenarios. Technically, we design a grasp-aware feature fusion module to integrate hand-object features with an object switcher to dynamically control the hand-object pose estimation according to grasping status. Further, to uplift the robustness of hand pose estimation regardless of object presence, we generate realistic de-occluded image pairs to train the model to learn object-induced hand occlusions, and formulate multi-level feature enhancement techniques for learning occlusion-invariant features. Extensive experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks demonstrate UniHOPE's SOTA performance in addressing hand-only and hand-object scenarios.

    "abstract": "Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizing reconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applications such as autonomous driving, an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation, rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However, a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders, which are highly efficient and popular. Here, we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task, where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably, our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference, making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks, car detection, and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods, paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks, while achieving remarkable success across diverse tasks, demand significant resources, including computation, GPU memory, bandwidth, storage, and energy. Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms",

Describing rules with natural language provides generalizable applications, but also raises cross-modal heterogeneity and hierarchical misalignment challenges. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach termed Procedural Heterogeneous Graph Completion (PHGC), which addresses these challenges with heterogeneous graphs representing the logic in rules and operation flows. Specifically, our PHGC method mainly consists of three key components: (1) Heterogeneous Graph Construction module that defines objective states and operation flows as vertices, with temporal and sequential relations as edges. (2) Cross-Modal Path Finding module that aligns semantic relations between hierarchical video and text elements. (3) Discriminative Entity Representation module excavates hidden entities that integrate general logical relations and discriminative cues to reveal final verification results. Additionally, we further constructed a new dataset called CSV-NL comprised of realistic videos.

In this work, we introduce Recognition-Synergistic Scene Text Editing (RS-STE), a novel approach that fully exploits the intrinsic synergy of text recognition for editing.

Motivated by this insight, we propose ConsMTL, which models MTL as a bi-level optimization problem: in the upper-level optimization, we perform gradient aggregation on shared parameters to find a joint update vector that minimizes gradient conflicts; in the lower-level optimization, we introduce an additional loss for task-specific parameters guiding the k gradients of shared parameters to gradually converge towards the joint update vector.

Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG cannot be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (*i.e.*, the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with ReCFG strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a **closed-form** solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables high-fidelity 3D scene synthesis with effective controllable editing through our factored diffusion approach",

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control. In addition, we devise an automated pipeline to construct an ID-based dataset for training HiFi-Portrait. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses the SOTA approaches in face similarity and controllability.

In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well.

To overcome this, we propose the Reinforced Active Sampling Scheduler, termed RaSS, intending to find the optimal sampling trajectory by actively planning and adjusting the sampling steps for each sampling process in time. Concretely, RaSS divides the whole sampling process into five stages and introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to continuously monitor the generated instance and perceive the potential generation results, thereby achieving optimal instance- and state-adaptive sampling steps decision. Meanwhile, a sampling reward is designed to assist the planning capability of the RL agent by balancing the sampling efficiency and generation quality. The RaSS is a plug-and-play module, which is applicable to multiple denoising diffusion samplers of diffusion models. Extensive experiments on different benchmarks have shown that our RaSS can consistently improve the generation quality and efficiency across various tasks, without introducing significant computational overhead",

However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are dynamically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets . For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "CLIP, a foundational vision-language model, has emerged as a powerful tool for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. While freezing the text encoder preserves its powerful embeddings, recent studies show that fine-tuning both the text and image encoders jointly significantly enhances segmentation performance, especially for classes from open sets. In this work, we explain this phenomenon from the perspective of hierarchical alignment, since during fine-tuning, the hierarchy level of image embeddings shifts from image-level to pixel-level. We achieve this by leveraging hyperbolic space, which naturally encoders hierarchical structures. Our key observation is that, during fine-tuning, the hyperbolic radius of CLIP's text embeddings decreases, facilitating better alignment with the pixel-level hierarchical structure of visual data. Building on this insight, we propose HyperCLIP, a novel fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the hyperbolic radius of the text embeddings through scaling transformations. By doing so, HyperCLIP equips CLIP with segmentation capability while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that HyperCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks across three benchmarks, while fine-tuning only approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP. More importantly, we observe that after adjustment, CLIP's text embeddings exhibit a relatively fixed hyperbolic radius across datasets, suggesting that the segmentation task has a characteristic level in hyperbolic space",

Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis, which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes. This paper presents TexGaussian, a novel method that uses octant-aligned 3D Gaussian Splatting for rapid PBR material generation. Specifically, we place each 3D Gaussian on the finest leaf node of the octree built from the input 3D mesh to render the multi-view images not only for the albedo map but also for roughness and metallic. Moreover, our model is trained in a regression manner instead of diffusion denoising, capable of generating the PBR material for a 3D mesh in a single feed-forward process. Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our method synthesizes more visually pleasing PBR materials and runs faster than previous methods in both unconditional and text-conditional scenarios, exhibiting better consistency with the given geometry.

However, their inherent iterative nature leads to substantial computational and time costs. Although techniques such as consistency distillation and adversarial training have been employed to accelerate video diffusion by reducing inference steps, these methods often simply transfer the generation approaches from Image diffusion models to video diffusion models. As a result, these methods frequently fall short in terms of both performance and training stability. In this work, we introduce a two-stage training framework that effectively combines consistency distillation with adversarial training to address these challenges. Additionally, we propose a novel video discriminator design, which eliminates the need for decoding the video latents and improves the final performance. Our model is capable of producing high-quality videos in merely one-step, with the flexibility to perform multi-step refinement for further performance enhancement. Our quantitative evaluation on the OpenVid-1M benchmark shows that our model significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, our 1-step performance (FVD 171.15) exceeds the 8-step performance of the consistency distillation based method, AnimateLCM (FVD 184.79), and approaches the 25-step performance of advanced Stable Video Diffusion (FVD 156.94)",

    "abstract": "Cross-modal retrieval aims to match related samples across distinct modalities, facilitating the retrieval and discovery of heterogeneous information. Although existing methods show promising performance, most are deterministic models and are unable to capture the uncertainty inherent in the retrieval outputs, leading to potentially unreliable results. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called FUzzy Multimodal lEarning (FUME), which is able to self-estimate epistemic uncertainty, thereby embracing trusted cross-modal retrieval. Specifically, our FUME leverages the Fuzzy Set Theory to view the outputs of the classification network as a set of membership degrees and quantify category credibility by incorporating both possibility and necessity measures. However, directly optimizing the category credibility could mislead the model by over-optimizing the necessity for unmatched categories. To overcome this challenge, we present a novel fuzzy multimodal learning strategy, which utilizes label information to guide necessity optimization in the right direction, thereby indirectly optimizing category credibility and achieving accurate decision uncertainty quantification. Furthermore, we design an uncertainty merging scheme that accounts for decision uncertainties, thus further refining uncertainty estimates and boosting the trustworthiness of retrieval results. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that FUME remarkably improves both retrieval performance and reliability, offering a prospective solution for cross-modal retrieval in high-stakes applications.

We particularly explore retrieval-augmented learning (RAL), which retrieves open data, e.g., the VLM's pretraining dataset, to learn models for better serving downstream tasks. RAL has been studied in zero-shot recognition but remains under-explored in FSR. Although applying RAL to FSR may seem straightforward, we observe interesting and novel challenges and opportunities. First, somewhat surprisingly, finetuning a VLM on a large amount of retrieved data underperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. This is due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps with the few-shot examples in the downstream task. Second, more surprisingly, we find that simply finetuning a VLM solely on few-shot examples significantly outperforms previous FSR methods, and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third, to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issues, we propose Stage-Wise retrieval-Augmented fineTuning (SWAT), which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data in the first stage and retraining the classifier on the few-shot data in the second stage.

    "title": "A Regularization-Guided Equivariant Approach for Image Restoration",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Equivariant and invariant deep learning models have been developed to exploit intrinsic symmetries in data, demonstrating significant effectiveness in certain scenarios. However, these methods often suffer from limited representation accuracy and rely on strict symmetry assumptions that may not hold in practice. These limitations pose a significant drawback for image restoration tasks, which demands high accuracy and precise symmetry representation. To address these challenges, we propose a rotation-equivariant regularization strategy that adaptively enforces the appropriate symmetry constraints on the data while preserving the network's representational accuracy. Specifically, we introduce EQ-Reg, a regularizer designed to enhance rotation equivariance, which innovatively extends the insights of data-augmentation-based and equivariant-based methodologies. This is achieved through self-supervised learning and the spatial rotation and cyclic channel shift of feature maps deduce in the equivariant framework. Our approach firstly enables a non-strictly equivariant network suitable for image restoration, providing a simple and adaptive mechanism for adjusting equivariance based on task. Extensive experiments across three low-level tasks demonstrate the superior accuracy and generalization capability of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently achieved remarkable progress in novel view synthesis. However, existing methods rely heavily on high-quality data for rendering and struggle to handle degraded scenes with multi-view inconsistency, leading to inferior rendering quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Depth-aware Gaussian Splatting for efficient 3D scene Restoration, called RestorGS, which flexibly restores multiple degraded scenes using a unified framework. Specifically, RestorGS consists of two core designs: Appearance Decoupling and Depth-Guided Modeling. The former exploits appearance learning over spherical harmonics to decouple clear and degraded Gaussian, thus separating the clear views from the degraded ones. Collaboratively, the latter leverages the depth information to guide the degradation modeling, thereby facilitating the decoupling process. Benefiting from the above optimization strategy, our method achieves high-quality restoration while enabling real-time rendering speed. Extensive experiments show that our RestorGS outperforms existing methods significantly in underwater, nighttime, and hazy scenes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel 3D-aware diffusion-based method for generating photorealistic talking head videos directly from a single identity image and explicit control signals (e.g., expressions). Our method generates Multiplane Images (MPIs) that ensure geometric consistency, making them ideal for immersive viewing experiences like binocular videos for VR headsets.Unlike existing methods that often require a separate stage or joint optimization to reconstruct a 3D representation (such as NeRF or 3D Gaussians), our approach directly generates the final output through a single denoising process, eliminating the need for post-processing steps to render novel views efficiently.To effectively learn from monocular videos, we introduce a training mechanism that reconstructs the output MPI randomly in either the target or the reference camera space. This approach enables the model to simultaneously learn sharp image details and underlying 3D information.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which achieves competitive avatar quality and novel-view rendering capabilities, even without explicit 3D reconstruction or high-quality multi-view training data",

    "title": "Deep Fair Multi-View Clustering with Attention KAN",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering is effective in unsupervised multi-view data analysis and has received considerable attention. However, most existing methods excessively emphasize certain attributes, resulting in unfair clustering outcomes, i.e., certain sensitive attributes dominate the clustering results. Moreover, existing methods struggle to effectively capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions across views, limiting their ability to achieve optimal clustering performance. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel method, Deep Fair Multi-View Clustering with Attention Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (DFMVC-AKAN), to generate fair clustering results while maintaining robust performance. DFMVC-AKAN integrates attention mechanisms into Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to exploit the complex nonlinear inter-view relationships. Specifically, KAN provides a nonlinear feature representation capable of efficiently approximating arbitrary multivariate continuous functions, augmented by a hybrid attention mechanism which enables the model to dynamically focus on the most relevant features. Finally, we refine the clustering assignments with a distribution alignment module to ensure fair outcomes across diverse groups while maintaining discriminative ability. Experimental results on four datasets containing sensitive attributes demonstrate that DFMVC-AKAN significantly improves fairness and clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods",
