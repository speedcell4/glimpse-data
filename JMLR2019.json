    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for domain adaptation improving upon a discrepancy minimization algorithm, (DM), previously shown to outperform a number of algorithms for this problem. Unlike many previously proposed solutions for domain adaptation, our algorithm does not consist of a fixed reweighting of the losses over the training sample. Instead, the reweighting depends on the hypothesis sought. The algorithm is derived from a less conservative notion of discrepancy than the DM algorithm called generalized discrepancy. We present a detailed description of our algorithm and show that it can be formulated as a convex optimization problem. We also give a detailed theoretical analysis of its learning guarantees which helps us select its parameters. Finally, we report the results of experiments demonstrating that it improves upon discrepancy minimization",

    "title": "Transport Analysis of Infinitely Deep Neural Network",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigated the feature map inside deep neural networks (DNNs) by tracking the transport map. We are interested in the role of depth---why do DNNs perform better than shallow models?---and the interpretation of DNNs---what do intermediate layers do? Despite the rapid development in their application, DNNs remain analytically unexplained because the hidden layers are nested and the parameters are not faithful. Inspired by the integral representation of shallow NNs, which is the continuum limit of the width, or the hidden unit number, we developed the flow representation and transport analysis of DNNs. The flow representation is the continuum limit of the depth, or the hidden layer number, and it is specified by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a vector field. We interpret an ordinary DNN as a transport map or an Euler broken line approximation of the flow. Technically speaking, a dynamical system is a natural model for the nested feature maps. In addition, it opens a new way to the coordinate-free treatment of DNNs by avoiding the redundant parametrization of DNNs. Following Wasserstein geometry, we analyze a flow in three aspects: dynamical system, continuity equation, and Wasserstein gradient flow. A key finding is that we specified a series of transport maps of the denoising autoencoder (DAE), which is a cornerstone for the development of deep learning. Starting from the shallow DAE, this paper develops three topics: the transport map of the deep DAE, the equivalence between the stacked DAE and the composition of DAEs, and the development of the double continuum limit or the integral representation of the flow representation. As partial answers to the research questions, we found that deeper DAEs converge faster and the extracted features are better; in addition, a deep Gaussian DAE transports mass to decrease the Shannon entropy of the data distribution. We expect that further investigations on these questions lead to the development of an interpretable and principled alternatives to DNNs",

    "abstract": "Despite their attractiveness, popular perception is that techniques for nonparametric function approximation do not scale to streaming data due to an intractable growth in the amount of storage they require. To solve this problem in a memory-affordable way, we propose an online technique based on functional stochastic gradient descent in tandem with supervised sparsification based on greedy function subspace projections. The method, called parsimonious online learning with kernels (POLK), provides a controllable tradeoff between its solution accuracy and the amount of memory it requires. We derive conditions under which the generated function sequence converges almost surely to the optimal function, and we establish that the memory requirement remains finite. We evaluate POLK for kernel multi-class logistic regression and kernel hinge-loss classification on three canonical data sets: a synthetic Gaussian mixture model, the MNIST hand-written digits, and the Brodatz texture database. On all three tasks, we observe a favorable trade-off of objective function evaluation, classification performance, and complexity of the nonparametric regressor extracted by the proposed method",

    "title": "Non-Convex Projected Gradient Descent for Generalized Low-Rank Tensor Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the problem of learning high-dimensional tensor regression problems with low-rank structure. One of the core challenges associated with learning high-dimensional models is computation since the underlying optimization problems are often non-convex. While convex relaxations could lead to polynomial-time algorithms they are often slow in practice. On the other hand, limited theoretical guarantees exist for non-convex methods. In this paper we provide a general framework that provides theoretical guarantees for learning high-dimensional tensor regression models under different low-rank structural assumptions using the projected gradient descent algorithm applied to a potentially non-convex constraint set $\\Theta$ in terms of its localized Gaussian width (due to Gaussian design). We juxtapose our theoretical results for non-convex projected gradient descent algorithms with previous results on regularized convex approaches. The two main differences between the convex and non-convex approach are: (i) from a computational perspective whether the non-convex projection operator is computable and whether the projection has desirable contraction properties and (ii) from a statistical error bound perspective, the non-convex approach has a superior rate for a number of examples. We provide three concrete examples of low-dimensional structure which address these issues and explain the pros and cons for the non-convex and convex approaches. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations which show that, under several common settings of generalized low rank tensor regression, the projected gradient descent approach is superior both in terms of statistical error and run-time provided the step-sizes of the projected descent algorithm are suitably chosen",

    "title": "Scalable Approximations for Generalized Linear Problems",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In stochastic optimization, the population risk is generally approximated by the empirical risk which is in turn minimized by an iterative algorithm. However, in the large-scale setting, empirical risk minimization may be computationally restrictive. In this paper, we design an efficient algorithm to approximate the population risk minimizer in generalized linear problems such as binary classification with surrogate losses and generalized linear regression models. We focus on large-scale problems where the iterative minimization of the empirical risk is computationally intractable, i.e., the number of observations $n$ is much larger than the dimension of the parameter $p$ ($n \\gg p \\gg 1$). We show that under random sub-Gaussian design, the true minimizer of the population risk is approximately proportional to the corresponding ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Using this relation, we design an algorithm that achieves the same accuracy as the empirical risk minimizer through iterations that attain up to a quadratic convergence rate, and that are computationally cheaper than any batch optimization algorithm by at least a factor of $\\mathcal{O}(p)$. We provide theoretical guarantees for our algorithm, and analyze the convergence behavior in terms of data dimensions. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on well-known classification and regression problems, through extensive numerical studies on large-scale datasets, and show that it achieves the highest performance compared to several other widely used optimization algorithms",

The idea is to temporarily discard the variables that are conditionally independent with the outcome given the selected variable set. Depending on how those variables are reconsidered and reintroduced, this heuristic gives rise to a family of algorithms with increasingly stronger theoretical guarantees. In distributions that can be faithfully represented by Bayesian networks or maximal ancestral graphs, members of this algorithmic family are able to correctly identify the Markov blanket in the sample limit. In experiments we show that the proposed heuristic increases computational efficiency by about 1-2 orders of magnitude, while selecting fewer or the same number of variables and retaining predictive performance. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm and feature selection with LASSO perform similarly when restricted to select the same number of variables, making the proposed algorithm an attractive alternative for problems where no (efficient) algorithm for LASSO exists",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the pricing problem faced by a firm that sells a large number of products, described via a wide range of features, to customers that arrive over time. Customers independently make purchasing decisions according to a general choice model that includes products features and customers' characteristics, encoded as $d$-dimensional numerical vectors, as well as the price offered. The parameters of the choice model are a priori unknown to the firm, but can be learned as the (binary-valued) sales data accrues over time. The firm's objective is to maximize its revenue. We benchmark the performance using the classic regret minimization framework where the regret is defined as the expected revenue loss against a clairvoyant policy that knows the parameters of the choice model in advance, and always offers the revenue-maximizing price. This setting is motivated in part by the prevalence of online marketplaces that allow for real-time pricing. We assume a structured choice model, parameters of which depend on $s_0$ out of the $d$ product features. Assuming that the market noise distribution is known, we propose a dynamic policy, called Regularized Maximum Likelihood Pricing (RMLP) that leverages the (sparsity) structure of the high-dimensional model and obtains a logarithmic regret in $T$. More specifically, the regret of our algorithm is of $O(s_0 \\log d \\cdot \\log T)$. Furthermore, we show that no policy can obtain regret better than $O(s_0 (\\log d + \\log T))$. {In addition, we propose a generalization of our policy to a setting that the market noise distribution is unknown but belongs to a parametrized family of distributions. This policy obtains regret of $O(\\sqrt{(\\log d)T})$. We further show that no policy can obtain regret better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ in such environments.}",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graphical Lasso (GL) is a popular method for learning the structure of an undirected graphical model, which is based on an $l_1$ regularization technique. The objective of this paper is to compare the computationally-heavy GL technique with a numerically-cheap heuristic method that is based on simply thresholding the sample covariance matrix. To this end, two notions of sign-consistent and inverse-consistent matrices are developed, and then it is shown that the thresholding and GL methods are equivalent if: (i) the thresholded sample covariance matrix is both sign-consistent and inverse-consistent, and (ii) the gap between the largest thresholded and the smallest un-thresholded entries of the sample covariance matrix is not too small. By building upon this result, it is proved that the GL method---as a conic optimization problem---has an explicit closed-form solution if the thresholded sample covariance matrix has an acyclic structure. This result is then generalized to arbitrary sparse support graphs, where a formula is found to obtain an approximate solution of GL. Furthermore, it is shown that the approximation error of the derived explicit formula decreases exponentially fast with respect to the length of the minimum-length cycle of the sparsity graph. The developed results are demonstrated on synthetic data, functional MRI data, traffic flows for transportation networks, and massive randomly generated data sets. We show that the proposed method can obtain an accurate approximation of the GL for instances with the sizes as large as $80,000\\times 80,000$ (more than 3.2 billion variables) in less than 30 minutes on a standard laptop computer running MATLAB, while other state-of-the-art methods do not converge within 4 hours",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Kernel $k$-means clustering can correctly identify and extract a far more varied collection of cluster structures than the linear $k$-means clustering algorithm. However, kernel $k$-means clustering is computationally expensive when the non-linear feature map is high-dimensional and there are many input points. Kernel approximation, e.g., the Nystrom method, has been applied in previous works to approximately solve kernel learning problems when both of the above conditions are present. This work analyzes the application of this paradigm to kernel $k$-means clustering, and shows that applying the linear $k$-means clustering algorithm to $\\frac{k}{\\epsilon} (1 + o(1))$ features constructed using a so-called rank-restricted Nystrom approximation results in cluster assignments that satisfy a $1 + \\epsilon$ approximation ratio in terms of the kernel $k$-means cost function, relative to the guarantee provided by the same algorithm without the use of the Nystrom method. As part of the analysis, this work establishes a novel $1 + \\epsilon$ relative-error trace norm guarantee for low-rank approximation using the rank-restricted Nystrom approximation. Empirical evaluations on the $8.1$ million instance MNIST8M dataset demonstrate the scalability and usefulness of kernel $k$-means clustering with Nystrom approximation. This work argues that spectral clustering using Nystrom approximation---a popular and computationally efficient, but theoretically unsound approach to non-linear clustering---should be replaced with the efficient and theoretically sound combination of kernel $k$-means clustering with Nystrom approximation. The superior performance of the latter approach is empirically verified",

The objective of this paper is to characterize a sub-class of the problem where good approximate solutions can be found using tractable approaches. Specifically, it is shown that under some conditions on the $\\varphi$-mixing coefficients, a modified version of UCB can prove effective. The main challenge is that, unlike in the i.i.d. setting, the distributions of the sampled pay-offs may not have the same characteristics as those of the original bandit arms.

    "abstract": "The automation of posterior inference in Bayesian data analysis has enabled experts and nonexperts alike to use more sophisticated models, engage in faster exploratory modeling and analysis, and ensure experimental reproducibility. However, standard automated posterior inference algorithms are not tractable at the scale of massive modern data sets, and modifications to make them so are typically model-specific, require expert tuning, and can break theoretical guarantees on inferential quality. Building on the Bayesian coresets framework, this work instead takes advantage of data redundancy to shrink the data set itself as a preprocessing step, providing fully-automated, scalable Bayesian inference with theoretical guarantees. We begin with an intuitive reformulation of Bayesian coreset construction as sparse vector sum approximation, and demonstrate that its automation and performance-based shortcomings arise from the use of the supremum norm. To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms---one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm---along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions. The resulting automated coreset construction algorithm is simple to implement, and experiments on a variety of models with real and synthetic data sets show that it provides high-quality posterior approximations and a significant reduction in the computational cost of inference",

In this article, we propose a smooth neighborhood recommender in the framework of the latent factor models. A similarity kernel is utilized to borrow neighborhood information from continuous covariates over a user-item specific network, such as a user's social network, where the grouping information defined by discrete covariates is also integrated through the network. Consequently, user-item specific information is built into the recommender to battle the `cold-start\" issue in the absence of observations in collaborative and content-based filtering. Moreover, we utilize a \"divide-and-conquer\" version of the alternating least squares algorithm to achieve scalable computation, and establish asymptotic results for the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves superior prediction accuracy.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Singular values of a data in a matrix form provide insights on the structure of the data, the effective dimensionality, and the choice of hyper-parameters on higher-level data analysis tools. However, in many practical applications such as collaborative filtering and network analysis, we only get a partial observation. Under such scenarios, we consider the fundamental problem of recovering spectral properties of the underlying matrix from a sampling of its entries. In this paper, we address the problem of directly recovering the spectrum, which is the set of singular values, and also in sample-efficient approaches for recovering a spectral sum function, which is an aggregate sum of a fixed function applied to each of the singular values. Our approach is to first estimate the Schatten $k$-norms of a matrix for a small set of values of $k$, and then apply Chebyshev approximation when estimating a spectral sum function or apply moment matching in Wasserstein distance when estimating the singular values directly. The main technical challenge is in accurately estimating the Schatten norms from a sampling of a matrix. We introduce a novel unbiased estimator based on counting small structures called network motifs in a graph and provide guarantees that match its empirical performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that Schatten norms can be recovered accurately from strictly smaller number of samples compared to what is needed to recover the underlying low-rank matrix. Numerical experiments suggest that we significantly improve upon a competing approach of using matrix completion methods, below the matrix completion threshold, above which matrix completion algorithms recover the underlying low-rank matrix exactly",

    "abstract": "Kernel-based methods exhibit well-documented performance in various nonlinear learning tasks. Most of them rely on a preselected kernel, whose prudent choice presumes task-specific prior information. Especially when the latter is not available, multi-kernel learning has gained popularity thanks to its flexibility in choosing kernels from a prescribed kernel dictionary. Leveraging the random feature approximation and its recent orthogonality-promoting variant, the present contribution develops a scalable multi-kernel learning scheme (termed Raker) to obtain the sought nonlinear learning function `on the fly,' first for static environments. To further boost performance in dynamic environments, an adaptive multi-kernel learning scheme (termed AdaRaker) is developed. AdaRaker accounts not only for data-driven learning of kernel combination, but also for the unknown dynamics. Performance is analyzed in terms of both static and dynamic regrets. AdaRaker is uniquely capable of tracking nonlinear learning functions in environments with unknown dynamics, and with with analytic performance guarantees Tests with synthetic and real datasets are carried out to showcase the effectiveness of the novel algorithms",

    "title": "Determining the Number of Latent Factors in Statistical Multi-Relational Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Statistical relational learning is primarily concerned with learning and inferring relationships between entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. Nickel et al. (2011) proposed a RESCAL tensor factorization model for statistical relational learning, which achieves better or at least comparable results on common benchmark data sets when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Given a positive integer $s$, RESCAL computes an $s$-dimensional latent vector for each entity. The latent factors can be further used for solving relational learning tasks, such as collective classification, collective entity resolution and link-based clustering. The focus of this paper is to determine the number of latent factors in the RESCAL model. Due to the structure of the RESCAL model, its log-likelihood function is not concave. As a result, the corresponding maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) may not be consistent. Nonetheless, we design a specific pseudometric, prove the consistency of the MLEs under this pseudometric and establish its rate of convergence. Based on these results, we propose a general class of information criteria and prove their model selection consistencies when the number of relations is either bounded or diverges at a proper rate of the number of entities. Simulations and real data examples show that our proposed information criteria have good finite sample properties",

In this work, we propose a generalization of PLDA that enables joint modeling of two sample-dependent factors: the class of interest and a nuisance condition. The approach does not change the basic form of PLDA but rather modifies the training procedure to consider the dependency across samples of the latent variable that models within-class variability. While the identity of the nuisance condition is needed during training, it is not needed during testing since we propose a scoring procedure that marginalizes over the corresponding latent variable. We show results on a multilingual speaker-verification task, where the language spoken is considered a nuisance condition. The proposed joint PLDA approach leads to significant performance gains in this task for two different data sets, in particular when the training data contains mostly or only monolingual speakers",

However, a precise study of these properties and how they affect learning guarantees is still missing. In this paper, we consider deep convolutional representations of signals; we study their invariance to translations and to more general groups of transformations, their stability to the action of diffeomorphisms, and their ability to preserve signal information. This analysis is carried by introducing a multilayer kernel based on convolutional kernel networks and by studying the geometry induced by the kernel mapping. We then characterize the corresponding reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), showing that it contains a large class of convolutional neural networks with homogeneous activation functions. This analysis allows us to separate data representation from learning, and to provide a canonical measure of model complexity, the RKHS norm, which controls both stability and generalization of any learned model. In addition to models in the constructed RKHS, our stability analysis also applies to convolutional networks with generic activations such as rectified linear units, and we discuss its relationship with recent generalization bounds based on spectral norms",

Our model describes feed-forward networks for classification, with one output node for each class. The only nonlinear operation is rectification using a ReLU function with a bias. However, there is a rectifier on every edge rather than at the nodes of the network. There are also weights, but these are positive, static, and associated with the nodes. Our rectified wire networks are able to represent arbitrary Boolean functions. Only the bias parameters, on the edges of the network, are learned. Another departure in our approach, from standard neural networks, is that the loss function is replaced by a constraint. This constraint is simply that the value of the output node associated with the correct class should be zero. Our model has the property that the exact norm-minimizing parameter update, required to correctly classify a training item, is the solution to a quadratic program that can be computed with a few passes through the network. We demonstrate a training algorithm using this update, called sequential deactivation (SDA), on MNIST and some synthetic datasets. Upon adopting a natural choice for the nodal weights, SDA has no hyperparameters other than those describing the network structure.

Specifically, the semidefinite relaxation is exact if the graph consists of \\(k\\) large disjoint subgraphs, corresponding to clusters, with weight concentrated within these subgraphs, plus a moderate number of nodes not belonging to any cluster. Further, we establish that if noise is weakly obscuring these clusters, i.e, the between-cluster edges are assigned very small weights, then we can recover significantly smaller clusters. For example, we show that in approximately sparse graphs, where the between-cluster weights tend to zero as the size $n$ of the graph tends to infinity, we can recover clusters of size polylogarithmic in $n$ under certain conditions on the distribution of edge weights.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A selective classifier $(f,g)$ comprises a classification function $f$ and a binary selection function $g$, which determines if the classifier abstains from prediction, or uses $f$ to predict. The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain. The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A \"fast\" rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by $\\tilde{O}(1/m)$ where $m$ is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and $\\tilde{O}$ hides logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm. We focus on the agnostic setting, for which there is a known algorithm called LESS that learns a PCS classifier and achieves a fast rejection rate (depending on Hannekeâs disagreement coefficient) under strong assumptions. We present an improved PCS learning algorithm called ILESS for which we show a fast rate (depending on Hanneke's disagreement coefficient) without any assumptions. Our rejection bound smoothly interpolates the realizable and agnostic settings. The main result of this paper is an equivalence between the following three entities: (i) the existence of a fast rejection rate for any PCS learning algorithm (such as ILESS); (ii) a poly-logarithmic bound for Hanneke's disagreement coefficient; and (iii) an exponential speedup for a new disagreement-based active learner called {\\ActiveiLESS}",

A basic instance of this trade-off is the problem of deciding when to make noisy and costly observations of a discrete-time Gaussian random walk, so as to minimise the posterior variance plus observation costs. We present the first proof that a simple policy, which observes when the posterior variance exceeds a threshold, is optimal for this problem. The proof generalises to a wide range of cost functions other than the posterior variance. It is based on a new verification theorem by Nino-Mora that guarantees threshold structure for Markov decision processes, and on the relation between binary sequences known as Christoffel words and the dynamics of discontinuous nonlinear maps, which frequently arise in physics, control and biology. This result implies that optimal policies for linear-quadratic-Gaussian control with costly observations have a threshold structure. It also implies that the restless bandit problem of observing multiple such time series, has a well-defined Whittle index policy. We discuss computation of that index, give closed-form formulae for it, and compare the performance of the associated index policy with heuristic policies",

On the other hand, message passing routines are distributed, simple, and easy to implement. In this paper we establish a framework to analyze Min-Sum to solve voltage and flow problems. We characterize the error committed by the algorithm on general weighted graphs in terms of hitting times of random walks defined on the computation trees that support the operations of the algorithms with time. For $d$-regular graphs with equal weights, we show that the convergence of the algorithms is controlled by the total variation distance between the distributions of non-backtracking random walks defined on the original graph that start from neighboring nodes.

Typically, the essential ingredient of these methods is some form of randomized dimension reduction, which accelerates computations, but also creates random approximation error. In this way, the dimension reduction step encodes a tradeoff between cost and accuracy. However, the exact numerical relationship between cost and accuracy is typically unknown, and consequently, it may be difficult for the user to precisely know (1) how accurate a given solution is, or (2) how much computation is needed to achieve a given level of accuracy. In the current paper, we study randomized matrix multiplication (sketching) as a prototype setting for addressing these general problems. As a solution, we develop a bootstrap method for directly estimating the accuracy as a function of the reduced dimension (as opposed to deriving worst-case bounds on the accuracy in terms of the reduced dimension). From a computational standpoint, the proposed method does not substantially increase the cost of standard sketching methods, and this is made possible by an \"extrapolation\" technique.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Machine learning with big data often involves large optimization models. For distributed optimization over a cluster of machines, frequent communication and synchronization of all model parameters (optimization variables) can be very costly. A promising solution is to use parameter servers to store different subsets of the model parameters, and update them asynchronously at different machines using local datasets. In this paper, we focus on distributed optimization of large linear models with convex loss functions, and propose a family of randomized primal-dual block coordinate algorithms that are especially suitable for asynchronous distributed implementation with parameter servers. In particular, we work with the saddle-point formulation of such problems which allows simultaneous data and model partitioning, and exploit its structure by doubly stochastic coordinate optimization with variance reduction (DSCOVR). Compared with other first-order distributed algorithms, we show that DSCOVR may require less amount of overall computation and communication, and less or no synchronization. We discuss the implementation details of the DSCOVR algorithms, and present numerical experiments on an industrial distributed computing system",

The conventional FD is a heuristic procedure that often outputs rank deficient matrices. To overcome the rank deficiency problem, we propose a new sketching strategy called robust frequent directions (RFD) by introducing a regularization term. RFD can be derived from an optimization problem. It updates the sketch matrix and the regularization term adaptively and jointly. RFD reduces the approximation error of FD without increasing the computational cost. We also apply RFD to online learning and propose an effective hyperparameter-free online Newton algorithm. We derive a regret bound for our online Newton algorithm based on RFD, which guarantees the robustness of the algorithm.

    "abstract": "We consider spectral clustering algorithms for community detection under a general bipartite stochastic block model (SBM). A modern spectral clustering algorithm consists of three steps: (1) regularization of an appropriate adjacency or Laplacian matrix (2) a form of spectral truncation and (3) a kmeans type algorithm in the reduced spectral domain. We focus on the adjacency-based spectral clustering and for the first step, propose a new data-driven regularization that can restore the concentration of the adjacency matrix even for the sparse networks. This result is based on recent work on regularization of random binary matrices, but avoids using unknown population level parameters, and instead estimates the necessary quantities from the data. We also propose and study a novel variation of the spectral truncation step and show how this variation changes the nature of the misclassification rate in a general SBM. We then show how the consistency results can be extended to models beyond SBMs, such as inhomogeneous random graph models with approximate clusters, including a graphon clustering problem, as well as general sub-Gaussian biclustering. A theme of the paper is providing a better understanding of the analysis of spectral methods for community detection and establishing consistency results, under fairly general clustering models and for a wide regime of degree growths, including sparse cases where the average expected degree grows arbitrarily slowly",

A globally aging population, rising healthcare costs, and increased access to patient-level data have created an urgent need for high-quality estimators of individualized treatment rules that can be applied to observational data. A recent and promising line of research for estimating individualized treatment rules recasts the problem of estimating an optimal treatment rule as a weighted classification problem. We consider a class of estimators for optimal treatment rules that are analogous to convex large-margin classifiers. The proposed class applies to observational data and is doubly-robust in the sense that correct specification of either a propensity or outcome model leads to consistent estimation of the optimal individualized treatment rule. Using techniques from semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive rates of convergence for the proposed estimators and use these rates to characterize the bias-variance trade-off for estimating individualized treatment rules with classification-based methods. Simulation experiments informed by these results demonstrate that it is possible to construct new estimators within the proposed framework that significantly outperform existing ones.

    "abstract": "Learning for control can acquire controllers for novel robotic tasks, paving the path for autonomous agents. Such controllers can be expert-designed policies, which typically require tuning of parameters for each task scenario. In this context, Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged as a promising approach for automatically tuning controllers. However, sample-efficiency can still be an issue for high-dimensional policies on hardware. Here, we develop an approach that utilizes simulation to learn structured feature transforms that map the original parameter space into a domain-informed space. During BO, similarity between controllers is now calculated in this transformed space. Experiments on the ATRIAS robot hardware and simulation show that our approach succeeds at sample-efficiently learning controllers for multiple robots. Another question arises: What if the simulation significantly differs from hardware? To answer this, we create increasingly approximate simulators and study the effect of increasing simulation-hardware mismatch on the performance of Bayesian optimization. We also compare our approach to other approaches from literature, and find it to be more reliable, especially in cases of high mismatch. Our experiments show that our approach succeeds across different controller types, bipedal robot models and simulator fidelity levels, making it applicable to a wide range of bipedal locomotion problems",

In this paper, we present the first BO algorithm that is provably no-regret and converges to the optimum without knowledge of the hyperparameters. During optimization we slowly adapt the hyperparameters of stationary kernels and thereby expand the associated function class over time, so that the BO algorithm considers more complex function candidates.

    "abstract": "The multi-armed bandit problem forms the foundation for solving a wide range of online stochastic optimization problems through a simple, yet effective mechanism. One simply casts the problem as a gambler who repeatedly pulls one out of N slot machine arms, eliciting random rewards. Learning of reward probabilities is then combined with reward maximization, by carefully balancing reward exploration against reward exploitation. In this paper, we address a particularly intriguing variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, referred to as the Stochastic Point Location (SPL) problem. The gambler is here only told whether the optimal arm (point) lies to the \"left\" or to the \"right\" of the arm pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability $1-\\pi$. This formulation thus targets optimization in continuous action spaces with both informative and deceptive feedback. To tackle this class of problems, we formulate a compact and scalable Bayesian representation of the solution space that simultaneously captures both the location of the optimal arm as well as the probability of receiving correct feedback. We further introduce the accompanying Thompson Sampling guided Stochastic Point Location (TS-SPL) scheme for balancing exploration against exploitation. By learning $\\pi$, TS-SPL also supports deceptive environments that are lying about the direction of the optimal arm. This, in turn, allows us to address the fundamental Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) problem. Empirical results demonstrate that our scheme deals with both deceptive and informative environments, significantly outperforming competing algorithms both for SRF and SPL",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been applied successfully to multi-agent scenarios. Typically, the observation vector for decentralized decision making is represented by a concatenation of the (local) information an agent gathers about other agents. However, concatenation scales poorly to swarm systems with a large number of homogeneous agents as it does not exploit the fundamental properties inherent to these systems: (i) the agents in the swarm are interchangeable and (ii) the exact number of agents in the swarm is irrelevant. Therefore, we propose a new state representation for deep multi-agent RL based on mean embeddings of distributions, where we treat the agents as samples and use the empirical mean embedding as input for a decentralized policy. We define different feature spaces of the mean embedding using histograms, radial basis functions and neural networks trained end-to-end. We evaluate the representation on two well-known problems from the swarm literature in a globally and locally observable setup. For the local setup we furthermore introduce simple communication protocols. Of all approaches, the mean embedding representation using neural network features enables the richest information exchange between neighboring agents, facilitating the development of complex collective strategies",

Inspired by language translation, a word translated from one language corresponds to only a few words in another language, we present an efficient method named Sparse Heterogeneous Feature Representation (SHFR) in this paper for multi-class HDA to learn a sparse feature transformation between domains with multiple classes. Specifically, we formulate the problem of learning the feature transformation as a compressed sensing problem by building multiple binary classifiers in the target domain as various measurement sensors, which are decomposed from the target multi-class classification problem. We show that the estimation error of the learned transformation decreases with the increasing number of binary classifiers. In other words, for adaptation across heterogeneous domains to be successful, it is necessary to construct a sufficient number of incoherent binary classifiers from the original multi-class classification problem. To achieve this, we propose to apply the error correcting output correcting (ECOC) scheme to generate incoherent classifiers. To speed up the learning of the feature transformation across domains, we apply an efficient batch-mode algorithm to solve the resultant nonnegative sparse recovery problem. Theoretically, we present a generalization error bound of our proposed HDA method under a multi-class setting.

In this paper, we propose a new method for the derivative estimation using the locally weighted least absolute deviation regression. Different from the local polynomial regression, the proposed method does not require a finite variance for the error term and so is robust to the presence of heavy-tailed errors. Meanwhile, it does not require a zero median or a positive density at zero for the error term in comparison with the local median regression. We further show that the proposed estimator with random difference is asymptotically equivalent to the (infinitely) composite quantile regression estimator. In other words, running one regression is equivalent to combining infinitely many quantile regressions. In addition, the proposed method is also extended to estimate the derivatives at the boundaries and to estimate higher-order derivatives. For the equidistant design, we derive theoretical results for the proposed estimators, including the asymptotic bias and variance, consistency, and asymptotic normality. Finally, we conduct simulation studies to demonstrate that the proposed method has better performance than the existing methods in the presence of outliers and heavy-tailed errors, and analyze the Chinese house price data for the past ten years to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method",

For the online pricing problem, both when the arriving buyer bids or only responds to the posted price, we design algorithms whose regret bounds scale with the best fixed price in-hindsight, rather than the range of the values. Under the bidding model, we further show our algorithms achieve a revenue convergence rate that matches the offline sample complexity of the single-item single-buyer auction. We also show regret bounds that are scale free, and match the offline sample complexity, when comparing to a benchmark that requires a lower bound on the market share. We further expand our results beyond pricing to multi-buyer auctions, and obtain online learning algorithms for auctions, with convergence rates matching the known sample complexity upper bound of online single-item multi-buyer auctions. These results are obtained by generalizing the classical learning from experts and multi-armed bandit problems to their multi-scale versions. In this version, the reward of each action is in a different range, and the regret with respect to a given action scales with its own range, rather than the maximum range. We obtain almost optimal multi-scale regret bounds by introducing a new Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm whose mirror map is the multi-scale version of the negative entropy function.

    "title": "Proximal Distance Algorithms: Theory and Practice",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Proximal distance algorithms combine the classical penalty method of constrained minimization with distance majorization. If $f(x)$ is the loss function, and $C$ is the constraint set in a constrained minimization problem, then the proximal distance principle mandates minimizing the penalized loss $f(x)+\\frac{\\rho}{2}dist(x,C)^2$ and following the solution $x_{\\rho}$ to its limit as $\\rho$ tends to $\\infty$. At each iteration the squared Euclidean distance $dist(x,C)^2$ is majorized by the spherical quadratic $\\|x-P_C(x_k)\\|^2$, where $P_C(x_k)$ denotes the projection of the current iterate $x_k$ onto $C$. The minimum of the surrogate function $f(x)+\\frac{\\rho}{2}\\|x-P_C(x_k)\\|^2$ is given by the proximal map $prox_{\\rho^{-1}f}[P_C(x_k)]$. The next iterate $x_{k+1}$ automatically decreases the original penalized loss for fixed $\\rho$. Since many explicit projections and proximal maps are known, it is straightforward to derive and implement novel optimization algorithms in this setting. These algorithms can take hundreds if not thousands of iterations to converge, but the simple nature of each iteration makes proximal distance algorithms competitive with traditional algorithms. For convex problems, proximal distance algorithms reduce to proximal gradient algorithms and therefore enjoy well understood convergence properties. For nonconvex problems, one can attack convergence by invoking Zangwill's theorem. Our numerical examples demonstrate the utility of proximal distance algorithms in various high-dimensional settings, including a) linear programming, b) constrained least squares, c) projection to the closest kinship matrix, d) projection onto a second-order cone constraint, e) calculation of Horn's copositive matrix index, f) linear complementarity programming, and g) sparse principal components analysis. The proximal distance algorithm in each case is competitive or superior in speed to traditional methods such as the interior point method and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

    "abstract": "Given a vertex of interest in a network $G_1$, the vertex nomination problem seeks to find the corresponding vertex of interest (if it exists) in a second network $G_2$. A vertex nomination scheme produces a list of the vertices in $G_2$, ranked according to how likely they are judged to be the corresponding vertex of interest in $G_2$. The vertex nomination problem and related information retrieval tasks have attracted much attention in the machine learning literature, with numerous applications to social and biological networks. However, the current framework has often been confined to a comparatively small class of network models, and the concept of statistically consistent vertex nomination schemes has been only shallowly explored. In this paper, we extend the vertex nomination problem to a very general statistical model of graphs. Further, drawing inspiration from the long-established classification framework in the pattern recognition literature, we provide definitions for the key notions of Bayes optimality and consistency in our extended vertex nomination framework, including a derivation of the Bayes optimal vertex nomination scheme. In addition, we prove that no universally consistent vertex nomination schemes exist. Illustrative examples are provided throughout",

The proposed method is based on a message passing type algorithm, and its fast convergence is guaranteed by the state evolution analysis, when covariates are provided as zero-mean independently and identically distributed Gaussian random variables. It is employed to implement bootstrapped Lasso (Bolasso) and stability selection, both of which are variable selection methods using resampling in conjunction with Lasso, and resolves their disadvantage regarding computational cost. To examine approximation accuracy and efficiency, numerical experiments were carried out using simulated datasets. Moreover, an application to a real-world dataset, the wine quality dataset, is presented.

We propose a distributed optimization framework where the dataset is \"encoded\" to have an over-complete representation with built-in redundancy, and the straggling nodes in the system are dynamically treated as missing, or as \"erasures\" at every iteration, whose loss is compensated by the embedded redundancy. For quadratic loss functions, we show that under a simple encoding scheme, many optimization algorithms (gradient descent, L-BFGS, and proximal gradient) operating under data parallelism converge to an approximate solution even when stragglers are ignored. Furthermore, we show a similar result for a wider class of convex loss functions when operating under model parallelism. The applicable classes of objectives covers several popular learning problems such as linear regression, LASSO, support vector machine, collaborative filtering, and generalized linear models including logistic regression. These convergence results are deterministic, i.e., they establish sample path convergence for arbitrary sequences of delay patterns or distributions on the nodes, and are independent of the tail behavior of the delay distribution. We demonstrate that equiangular tight frames have desirable properties as encoding matrices, and propose efficient mechanisms for encoding large-scale data. We implement the proposed technique on Amazon EC2 clusters, and demonstrate its performance over several learning problems, including matrix factorization, LASSO, ridge regression and logistic regression, and compare the proposed method with uncoded, asynchronous, and data replication strategies",

In this context, there is a need for computational techniques to limit unfairness in algorithmic decision making. In this work, we take a step forward to fulfill that need and introduce a flexible constraint-based framework to enable the design of fair margin-based classifiers. The main technical innovation of our framework is a general and intuitive measure of decision boundary unfairness, which serves as a tractable proxy to several of the most popular computational definitions of unfairness from the literature. Leveraging our measure, we can reduce the design of fair margin-based classifiers to adding tractable constraints on their decision boundaries.

The first, symmetric component, is related to potential games, which reduce to gradient descent on an implicit function. The second, antisymmetric component, relates to Hamiltonian games, a new class of games that obey a conservation law akin to conservation laws in classical mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in differentiable games.

A major challenge when partitioning a map is the huge number of possible partitions that compose the search space.

We introduce a spatio-temporal product partition model that deals with the regionalization problem in a probabilistic way. Random spanning trees are used as a tool to tackle the problem of searching the space of possible partitions making feasible this exploration. Based on this framework, we propose an efficient Gibbs sampler algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters, specially the random partition. The proposed Gibbs sampler scheme carries out a random walk on the space of the spanning trees and the partitions induced by deleting tree edges. In the purely spatial situation, we compare our proposed model with other state-of-art regionalization techniques to partition maps using simulated and real social and health data. To illustrate how the temporal component is handled by the algorithm and to show how the spatial clusters vary along the time we presented an application using human development index data.

We refer to this form of dependency as \"region sparsity.\" Classical sparse regression methods, such as the lasso and automatic relevance determination (ARD), which model parameters as independent a priori, and therefore do not exploit such dependencies. Here we introduce a hierarchical model for smooth, region-sparse weight vectors and tensors in a linear regression setting. Our approach represents a hierarchical extension of the relevance determination framework, where we add a transformed Gaussian process to model the dependencies between the prior variances of regression weights. We combine this with a structured model of the prior variances of Fourier coefficients, which eliminates unnecessary high frequencies. The resulting prior encourages weights to be region-sparse in two different bases simultaneously. We develop Laplace approximation and Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) sampling to provide efficient inference for the posterior. Furthermore, a two-stage convex relaxation of the Laplace approximation approach is also provided to relax the inevitable non-convexity during the optimization.

However, a large volume of applied work optimizes traditional non-Bayesian NMF objectives that fail to provide a principled understanding of the non-identifiability inherent in NMF---an issue ideally addressed by a Bayesian approach. Despite their suitability, current BNMF approaches have failed to gain popularity in an applied setting; they sacrifice flexibility in modeling for tractable computation, tend to get stuck in local modes, and can require many thousands of samples for meaningful uncertainty estimates. We address these issues through a particle-based variational approach to BNMF that only requires the joint likelihood to be differentiable for computational tractability, uses a novel transfer-based initialization technique to identify multiple modes in the posterior, and thus allows domain experts to inspect a small set of factorizations that faithfully represent the posterior. On several real datasets, we obtain better particle approximations to the BNMF posterior in less time than baselines and demonstrate the significant role that multimodality plays in NMF-related tasks",

The goal is to identify the best (or approximately best) true distribution with high probability, with a secondary goal of providing guarantees on the quality of this distribution. The primary challenge of the contaminated bandit setting is that the true distributions are only partially identifiable, even with infinite samples. To address this, we develop tight, non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds for high-probability estimation of the first two robust moments (median and median absolute deviation) from contaminated samples. These concentration inequalities are the main technical contributions of the paper and may be of independent interest. Using these results, we adapt several classical Best Arm Identification algorithms to the contaminated bandit setting and derive sample complexity upper bounds for our problem.

Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) provides a robust and computationally efficient procedure to construct low-dimensional geometric approximations of $\\mathcal{M}$ at varying resolutions. We introduce GMRA approximations that adapt to the unknown regularity of $\\mathcal{M}$, by introducing a thresholding algorithm on the geometric wavelet coefficients. We show that these data-driven, empirical geometric approximations perform well, when the threshold is chosen as a suitable universal function of the number of samples $n$, on a large class of measures $\\rho$, that are allowed to exhibit different regularity at different scales and locations, thereby efficiently encoding data from more complex measures than those supported on manifolds. These GMRA approximations are associated to a dictionary, together with a fast transform mapping data to $d$-dimensional coefficients, and an inverse of such a map, all of which are data-driven. The algorithms for both the dictionary construction and the transforms have complexity $C D n \\log n$ with the constant $C$ exponential in $d$. Our work therefore establishes Adaptive GMRA as a fast dictionary learning algorithm, with approximation guarantees, for intrinsically low-dimensional data.

The iterations make HMC computationally costly, especially in problems with large data sets, since it is necessary to compute posterior densities and their derivatives with respect to the parameters. Naively computing the Hamiltonian dynamics on a subset of the data causes HMC to lose its key ability to generate distant parameter proposals with high acceptance probability. The key insight in our article is that efficient subsampling HMC for the parameters is possible if both the dynamics and the acceptance probability are computed from the same data subsample in each complete HMC iteration. We show that this is possible to do in a principled way in a HMC-within-Gibbs framework where the subsample is updated using a pseudo marginal MH step and the parameters are then updated using an HMC step, based on the current subsample. We show that our subsampling methods are fast and compare favorably to two popular sampling algorithms that use gradient estimates from data subsampling. We also explore the current limitations of subsampling HMC algorithms by varying the quality of the variance reducing control variates used in the estimators of the posterior density and its gradients",

Second, we establish the minimax rates of estimation under the new permutation-based model, and prove that surprisingly, the minimax rates are equivalent up to logarithmic factors to those for estimation under the typical low rank model. Third, we analyze a computationally efficient singular-value-thresholding algorithm, known to be optimal for the low-rank setting, and show that it also simultaneously yields a consistent estimator for the low-permutation rank setting.

These dual conditions are satisfied by a wide class of matrix factorization problems, although matrix factorization is hard to solve in full generality. This analytical framework may be of independent interest to non-convex optimization more broadly.

In this paper we introduce new regularization techniques using ideas from distributionally robust optimization, and we give new probabilistic interpretations to existing techniques. Specifically, we propose to minimize the worst-case expected loss, where the worst case is taken over the ball of all (continuous or discrete) distributions that have a bounded transportation distance from the (discrete) empirical distribution. By choosing the radius of this ball judiciously, we can guarantee that the worst-case expected loss provides an upper confidence bound on the loss on test data, thus offering new generalization bounds. We prove that the resulting regularized learning problems are tractable and can be tractably kernelized for many popular loss functions.

The computational challenge posed by OSCAR, for high dimensional and/or large sample size data, has not yet been well resolved due to the non-smoothness and non-separability of the regularizer involved. In this paper, we successfully resolve this numerical challenge by proposing a sparse semismooth Newton-based augmented Lagrangian method to solve the more general SLOPE (the sorted L-one penalized estimation) model. By appropriately exploiting the inherent sparse and low-rank property of the generalized Jacobian of the semismooth Newton system in the augmented Lagrangian subproblem, we show how the computational complexity can be substantially reduced.

Our suggested method is not only scalable but also performs simultaneous dimensionality reduction and variable selection.

Such settings often arise in case-control studies, where the sampled units are correlated due to spatial proximity, family relations, or other sources of relatedness. Maximum likelihood estimation in such settings is challenging from both a computational and statistical perspective, necessitating approximations that take the sampling scheme into account. We propose a family of approximate likelihood approaches which combine composite likelihood and expectation propagation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our solutions via extensive simulations. We utilize them to investigate the genetic architecture of several complex disorders collected in case-control genetic association studies, where hundreds of thousands of genetic variants are measured for every individual, and the underlying disease liabilities of individuals are correlated due to genetic similarity.

    "abstract": "The global Markov property for Gaussian graphical models ensures graph separation implies conditional independence. Specifically if a node set $S$ graph separates nodes $u$ and $v$ then $X_u$ is conditionally independent of $X_v$ given $X_S$. The opposite direction need not be true, that is, $X_u \\perp X_v \\mid X_S$ need not imply $S$ is a node separator of $u$ and $v$. When it does, the relation $X_u \\perp X_v \\mid X_S$ is called faithful. In this paper we provide a characterization of faithful relations and then provide an algorithm to test faithfulness based only on knowledge of other conditional relations of the form $X_i \\perp X_j \\mid X_S$. We study two classes of separable Gaussian graphical models, namely, weakly $K$-separable and strongly $K$-separable Gaussian graphical models. Using the above test for faithfulness, we introduce algorithms to learn the topologies of weakly $K$-separable and strongly $K$-separable Gaussian graphical models with $\\Omega(K\\log p)$ sample complexity.

    "abstract": "We propose a two step algorithm based on $\\ell_1/\\ell_0$ regularization for the detection and estimation of parameters of a high dimensional change point regression model and provide the corresponding rates of convergence for the change point as well as the regression parameter estimates. Importantly, the computational cost of our estimator is only $2\\cdotp$Lasso$(n,p)$, where Lasso$(n,p)$ represents the computational burden of one Lasso optimization in a model of size $(n,p)$. In comparison, existing grid search based approaches to this problem require a computational cost of at least $n\\cdot Lasso(n,p)$ optimizations. Additionally, the proposed method is shown to be able to consistently detect the case of 'no change', i.e., where no finite change point exists in the model. We allow the true change point parameter $\\tau_0$ to possibly move to the boundaries of its parametric space, and the jump size $\\|b_0-g_0\\|_2$ to possibly diverge as $n$ increases. We then characterize the corresponding effects on the rates of convergence of the change point and regression estimates. In particular, we show that, while an increasing jump size may have a beneficial effect on the change point estimate, however the optimal rate of regression parameter estimates are preserved only upto a certain rate of the increasing jump size. This behavior in the rate of regression parameter estimates is unique to high dimensional change point regression models only. Simulations are performed to empirically evaluate performance of the proposed estimators. The methodology is applied to community level socio-economic data of the U.S., collected from the 1990 U.S. census and other sources",

We study how this relationship varies with the training algorithm, model, and data set, and find extremely large variation between workloads. Along the way, we show that disagreements in the literature on how batch size affects model quality can largely be explained by differences in metaparameter tuning and compute budgets at different batch sizes. We find no evidence that larger batch sizes degrade out-of-sample performance. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on efforts to train neural networks much faster in the future.

This paper studies distributed inference for linear support vector machine (SVM) for the binary classification task. Despite a vast literature on SVM, much less is known about the inferential properties of SVM, especially in a distributed setting. In this paper, we propose a multi-round distributed linear-type (MDL) estimator for conducting inference for linear SVM. The proposed estimator is computationally efficient. In particular, it only requires an initial SVM estimator and then successively refines the estimator by solving simple weighted least squares problem. Theoretically, we establish the Bahadur representation of the estimator. Based on the representation, the asymptotic normality is further derived, which shows that the MDL estimator achieves the optimal statistical efficiency, i.e., the same efficiency as the classical linear SVM applying to the entire data set in a single machine setup. Moreover, our asymptotic result avoids the condition on the number of machines or data batches, which is commonly assumed in distributed estimation literature, and allows the case of diverging dimension. We provide simulation studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed MDL estimator",

Furthermore, the method is scalable to large datasets which is achieved by using an augmented prior via the inducing-variable approach underpinning most sparse GP approximations, along with parallel computation and stochastic optimization. We evaluate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively with experiments on small datasets, medium-scale datasets and large datasets, showing its competitiveness under different likelihood models and sparsity levels.

In each group of binary features coming from the one-hot encoding of a single raw continuous feature, this penalization uses total-variation regularization together with an extra linear constraint. This induces two interesting properties on the model weights of the one-hot encoded features: they are piecewise constant, and are eventually block sparse. Non-asymptotic oracle inequalities for generalized linear models are proposed. Moreover, under a sparse additive model assumption, we prove that our procedure matches the state-of-the-art in this setting.

    "abstract": "Nonparametric estimation of multivariate functions is an important problem in statistical machine learning with many applications, ranging from nonparametric regression to nonparametric graphical models. Several authors have proposed to estimate multivariate functions under the smoothing spline analysis of variance (SSANOVA) framework, which assumes that the multivariate function can be decomposed into the summation of main effects, two-way interaction effects, and higher order interaction effects. However, existing methods are not scalable to the dimension of the random variables and the order of interactions. We propose a LAyer-wiSE leaRning strategy (LASER) to estimate multivariate functions under the SSANOVA framework. The main idea is to approximate the multivariate function sequentially starting from a model with only the main effects. Conditioned on the support of the estimated main effects, we estimate the two-way interaction effects only when the corresponding main effects are estimated to be non-zero. This process is continued until no more higher order interaction effects are identified. The proposed strategy provides a data-driven approach for estimating multivariate functions under the SSANOVA framework. Our proposal yields a sequence of estimators. To establish the theoretical properties of the sequence of estimators, we establish the notion of post-selection persistency.

It has achieved great successes in many real-world applications. However, for large-scale problems involving a huge number of samples and ultra-high dimensional features, solving sparse SVMs remains challenging. By noting that sparse SVMs induce sparsities in both feature and sample spaces, we propose a novel approach, which is based on accurate estimations of the primal and dual optima of sparse SVMs, to simultaneously identify the inactive features and samples that are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the outputs. Thus, we can remove the identified inactive samples and features from the training phase, leading to substantial savings in the computational cost without sacrificing the accuracy. Moreover, we show that our method can be extended to multi-class sparse support vector machines. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first static feature and sample reduction method for sparse SVMs and multi-class sparse SVMs. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and the speedup gained by our approach can be orders of magnitude",

Recently, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving optimization problems whose objective functions are only available as a black box and are expensive to evaluate. Many practical problems, however, involve optimization of an unknown objective function subject to unknown constraints. This is an important yet challenging problem for which, unlike optimizing an unknown function, existing methods face several limitations. In this paper, we present a novel constrained Bayesian optimization framework to optimize an unknown objective function subject to unknown constraints. We introduce an equivalent optimization by augmenting the objective function with constraints, introducing auxiliary variables for each constraint, and forcing the new variables to be equal to the main variable. Building on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm, we propose ADMM-Bayesian Optimization (ADMMBO) to solve the problem in an iterative fashion. Our framework leads to multiple unconstrained subproblems with unknown objective functions, which we then solve via BO. Our method resolves several challenges of state-of-the-art techniques: it can start from infeasible points, is insensitive to initialization, can efficiently handle `decoupled problems' and has a concrete stopping criterion. Extensive experiments on a number of challenging BO benchmark problems show that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the speed of obtaining a feasible solution and convergence to the global optimum as well as minimizing the number of total evaluations of unknown objective and constraints functions",

In particular, we focus on persistent homology, the prevalent tool used in topological data analysis. As the summary representations, referred to as barcodes or persistence diagrams, come in the unusual format of multi sets, equipped with computationally expensive metrics, they can not readily be processed with conventional learning techniques. While different approaches to address this problem have been proposed, either in the context of kernel-based learning, or via carefully designed vectorization techniques, it remains an open problem how to leverage advances in representation learning via deep neural networks. Appropriately handling topological summaries as input to neural networks would address the disadvantage of previous strategies which handle this type of data in a task-agnostic manner. In particular, we propose an approach that is designed to learn a task-specific representation of barcodes. In other words, we aim to learn a representation that adapts to the learning problem while, at the same time, preserving theoretical properties (such as stability). This is done by projecting barcodes into a finite dimensional vector space using a collection of parametrized functionals, so called structure elements, for which we provide a generic construction scheme. A theoretical analysis of this approach reveals sufficient conditions to preserve stability, and also shows that different choices of structure elements lead to great differences with respect to their suitability for numerical optimization. When implemented as a neural network input layer, our approach demonstrates compelling performance on various types of problems, including graph classification and eigenvalue prediction, the classification of 2D/3D object shapes and recognizing activities from EEG signals",

Consequently there is currently interest among researchers in the potential for allowing RL algorithms to adaptively generate (i.e. to learn) approximation architectures. One relatively unexplored method of adapting approximation architectures involves using feedback regarding the frequency with which an agent has visited certain states to guide which areas of the state space to approximate with greater detail.

The proposed methodology is compared to existing methodologies on real-world data sets and is found to be highly competitive, typically yielding the best performance in terms of Brier score and binomial log-likelihood.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Our interest in this paper is in the construction of symbolic explanations for predictions made by a deep neural network. We will focus attention on deep relational machines (DRMs: a term introduced in Lodhi (2013)). A DRM is a deep network in which the input layer consists of Boolean-valued functions (features) that are defined in terms of relations provided as domain, or background, knowledge. Our DRMs differ from those in Lodhi (2013), which uses an Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) engine to first select features (we use random selections from a space of features that satisfies some approximate constraints on logical relevance and non-redundancy). But why do the DRMs predict what they do? One way of answering this was provided in recent work Ribeiro et al. (2016), by constructing readable proxies for a black-box predictor. The proxies are intended only to model the predictions of the black-box in local regions of the instance-space. But readability alone may not be enough: to be understandable, the local models must use relevant concepts in an meaningful manner. We investigate the use of a Bayes-like approach to identify logical proxies for local predictions of a DRM. As a preliminary step, we show that DRM's with our randomised propositionalization method achieve predictive performance that is comparable to the best reports in the ILP literature. Our principal results on logical explanations show: (a) Models in first-order logic can approximate the DRM's prediction closely in a small local region; and (b) Expert-provided relevance information can play the role of a prior to distinguish between logical explanations that perform equivalently on prediction alone",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent work on variational autoencoders (VAEs) has enabled the development of generative topic models using neural networks. Topic models based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) successfully use the Dirichlet distribution as a prior for the topic and word distributions to enforce sparseness. However, there is a trade-off between sparsity and smoothness in Dirichlet distributions. Sparsity is important for a low reconstruction error during training of the autoencoder, whereas smoothness enables generalization and leads to a better log-likelihood of the test data. Both of these properties are encoded in the Dirichlet parameter vector. By rewriting this parameter vector into a product of a sparse binary vector and a smoothness vector, we decouple the two properties, leading to a model that features both a competitive topic coherence and a high log-likelihood. Efficient training is enabled using rejection sampling variational inference for the reparameterization of the Dirichlet distribution. Our experiments show that our method is competitive with other recent VAE topic models",

This is computationally advantageous when available random-access memory is not enough to hold the full data. Interestingly, asymptotic distributions also show that Poisson subsampling produces a more efficient estimator if the sampling ratio, the ratio of the subsample size to the full data sample size, does not converge to zero. We also obtain the unconditional asymptotic distribution for the estimator based on Poisson subsampling. Pilot estimators are required to calculate subsampling probabilities and to correct biases in un-weighted estimators; interestingly, even if pilot estimators are inconsistent, the proposed method still produce consistent and asymptotically normal estimators",

Despite their non-convexity, gradient-descent methods often successfully optimize these models. This has motivated a recent spur in research attempting to characterize properties of their loss surface that may explain such success. In this paper, we address this phenomenon by studying a key topological property of the loss: the presence or absence of spurious valleys, defined as connected components of sub-level sets that do not include a global minimum. Focusing on a class of one-hidden-layer neural networks defined by smooth (but generally non-linear) activation functions, we identify a notion of intrinsic dimension and show that it provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the absence of spurious valleys. More concretely, finite intrinsic dimension guarantees that for sufficiently overparametrised models no spurious valleys exist, independently of the data distribution. Conversely, infinite intrinsic dimension implies that spurious valleys do exist for certain data distributions, independently of model overparametrisation. Besides these positive and negative results, we show that, although spurious valleys may exist in general, they are confined to low risk levels and avoided with high probability on overparametrised models",

We consider a GP $f$ over functions on $\\mathcal{X} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ taking values in $\\mathbb{R}$, where the process $linop f$ is still Gaussian when $linop $ is a linear operator. Our goal is to model $f$ under the constraint that realizations of $linop f$ are confined to a convex set of functions. In particular, we require that $a \\leq linop f \\leq b$, given two functions $a$ and $b$ where $a < b$ pointwise. This formulation provides a consistent way of encoding multiple linear constraints, such as shape-constraints based on e.g. boundedness, monotonicity or convexity. We adopt the approach of using a sufficiently dense set of virtual observation locations where the constraint is required to hold, and derive the exact posterior for a conjugate likelihood.

We provide concrete mathematical evidence that using a local regularization of the noisy data to define the similarity improves the approximation of the hidden Euclidean distance between unperturbed points. Furthermore, graph-based objects constructed with the locally regularized similarity function satisfy better error bounds in their recovery of global geometric ones.

    "abstract": "The problem of multiclass boosting is considered. A new formulation is presented, combining multi-dimensional predictors, multi-dimensional real-valued codewords, and proper multiclass margin loss functions. This leads to a number of contributions, such as maximum capacity codeword sets, a family of proper and margin enforcing losses, denoted as $\\gamma-\\phi$ losses, and two new multiclass boosting algorithms. These are descent procedures on the functional space spanned by a set of weak learners. The first, CD-MCBoost, is a coordinate descent procedure that updates one predictor component at a time. The second, GD-MCBoost, a gradient descent procedure that updates all components jointly. Both MCBoost algorithms are defined with respect to a $\\gamma-\\phi$ loss and can reduce to classical boosting procedures (such as AdaBoost and LogitBoost) for binary problems. Beyond the algorithms themselves, the proposed formulation enables a unified treatment of many previous multiclass boosting algorithms. This is used to show that the latter implement different combinations of optimization strategy, codewords, weak learners, and loss function, highlighting some of their deficiencies. It is shown that no previous method matches the support of MCBoost for real codewords of maximum capacity, a proper margin-enforcing loss function, and any family of multidimensional predictors and weak learners. Experimental results confirm the superiority of MCBoost, showing that the two proposed MCBoost algorithms outperform comparable prior methods on a number of datasets.\\\\ \\\\ \\textbf{Keywords}: Boosting, Multiclass Boosting, Multiclass Classification, Margin Maximization, Loss Function",

In this paper, we consider the double-sparsity model introduced by Rubinstein et al. (2010b) where the dictionary itself is the product of a fixed, known basis and a data-adaptive sparse component. First, we introduce a simple algorithm for double-sparse coding that can be amenable to efficient implementation via neural architectures. Second, we theoretically analyze its performance and demonstrate asymptotic sample complexity and running time benefits over existing (provable) approaches for sparse coding. To our knowledge, our work introduces the first computationally efficient algorithm for double-sparse coding that enjoys rigorous statistical guarantees.

A closed form of the representation matrices is first given for the self-expressiveness, and the connection of diagonal blocks is addressed.

Existing conditions for verifying the convergence of Gaussian BP are all tailored for one particular pairwise factorization of the distribution in Gaussian Markov random field (MRF) and may not be valid for another pairwise factorization. On the other hand, convergence conditions of Gaussian BP in pairwise linear Gaussian model are developed independently from those in Gaussian MRF, making the convergence results highly scattered with diverse settings. In this paper, the convergence condition of Gaussian BP is investigated under a general pairwise factorization, which includes Gaussian MRF and pairwise linear Gaussian model as special cases. Upon this, existing convergence conditions in Gaussian MRF are extended to any pairwise factorization. Moreover, the newly established link between Gaussian MRF and pairwise linear Gaussian model reveals an easily verifiable sufficient convergence condition in pairwise linear Gaussian model, which provides a unified criterion for assessing the convergence of Gaussian BP in multiple applications.

    "abstract": "The problem is that of sequential probability forecasting for finite-valued time series. The data is generated by an unknown probability distribution over the space of all one-way infinite sequences. Two settings are considered: the realizable and the non-realizable one. Assume first that the probability measure generating the sequence belongs to a given set $C$ (realizable case), but the latter is completely arbitrary (uncountably infinite, without any structure given). It is shown that the minimax asymptotic average loss---which may be positive---is always attainable, and it is attained by a Bayesian predictor whose prior is discrete and concentrated on $C$. Moreover, the finite-time loss of the Bayesian predictor is also optimal up to an additive $\\log n$ term (where $n$ is the time step). This upper bound is complemented by a lower bound that goes to infinity but may do so arbitrarily slow. Passing to the non-realizable setting, let the probability measure generating the data be arbitrary, and consider the given set $C$ as a set of experts to compete with. The goal is to minimize the regret with respect to the experts. It is shown that in this setting it is possible that all Bayesian strategies are strictly suboptimal even asymptotically. In other words, a sublinear regret may be attainable but the regret of every Bayesian predictor is linear. A very general recommendation for choosing a model can be made based on these results: it is better to take a model large enough to make sure it includes the process that generates the data, even if it entails positive asymptotic average loss, for otherwise any combination of predictors in the model class may be useless",

    "title": "Learning Optimized Risk Scores",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Risk scores are simple classification models that let users make quick risk predictions by adding and subtracting a few small numbers. These models are widely used in medicine and criminal justice, but are difficult to learn from data because they need to be calibrated, sparse, use small integer coefficients, and obey application-specific constraints. In this paper, we introduce a machine learning method to learn risk scores. We formulate the risk score problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, and present a cutting plane algorithm to recover its optimal solution. We improve our algorithm with specialized techniques that generate feasible solutions, narrow the optimality gap, and reduce data-related computation. Our algorithm can train risk scores in a way that scales linearly in the number of samples in a dataset, and that allows practitioners to address application-specific constraints without parameter tuning or post-processing. We benchmark the performance of different methods to learn risk scores on publicly available datasets, comparing risk scores produced by our method to risk scores built using methods that are used in practice. We also discuss the practical benefits of our method through a real-world application where we build a customized risk score for ICU seizure prediction in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital",

    "abstract": "Topological data analysis refers to a broad set of techniques that are used to make inferences about the shape of data. A popular topological summary is the persistence diagram. Through the language of random sets, we describe a notion of global probability density function for persistence diagrams that fully characterizes their behavior and in part provides a noise likelihood model. Our approach encapsulates the number of topological features and considers the appearance or disappearance of those near the diagonal in a stable fashion. In particular, the structure of our kernel individually tracks long persistence features, while considering those near the diagonal as a collective unit. The choice to describe short persistence features as a group reduces computation time while simultaneously retaining accuracy. Indeed, we prove that the associated kernel density estimate converges to the true distribution as the number of persistence diagrams increases and the bandwidth shrinks accordingly. We also establish the convergence of the mean absolute deviation estimate, defined according to the bottleneck metric. Lastly, examples of kernel density estimation are presented for typical underlying datasets as well as for virtual electroencephalographic data related to cognition",

We investigate this problem under two communication schemes (centralized and decentralized) and four classical regularity assumptions: Lipschitz continuity, strong convexity, smoothness, and a combination of strong convexity and smoothness. Under the decentralized communication scheme, we provide matching upper and lower bounds of complexity along with algorithms achieving this rate up to logarithmic constants. For non-smooth objective functions, while the dominant term of the error is in $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$, the structure of the communication network only impacts a second-order term in $O(1/t)$, where $t$ is time. In other words, the error due to limits in communication resources decreases at a fast rate even in the case of non-strongly convex objective functions. Such a convergence rate is achieved by the novel multi-step primal-dual (MSPD) algorithm. Under the centralized communication scheme, we show that the naive distribution of standard optimization algorithms is optimal for smooth objective functions, and provide a simple yet efficient algorithm called distributed randomized smoothing (DRS) based on a local smoothing of the objective function for non-smooth functions. We then show that DRS is within a $d^{1/4}$ multiplicative factor of the optimal convergence rate, where $d$ is the underlying dimension",

LUND is suitable for data generated from mixtures of distributions with densities that are both multimodal and supported near nonlinear sets. A crucial aspect of this algorithm is the use of time of a data-adapted diffusion process, and associated diffusion distances, as a scale parameter that is different from the local spatial scale parameter used in many clustering algorithms. We prove estimates for the behavior of diffusion distances with respect to this time parameter under a flexible nonparametric data model, identifying a range of times in which the mesoscopic equilibria of the underlying process are revealed, corresponding to a gap between within-cluster and between-cluster diffusion distances. These structures may be missed by the top eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian, commonly used in spectral clustering. This analysis is leveraged to prove sufficient conditions guaranteeing the accuracy of LUND. We implement LUND and confirm its theoretical properties on illustrative data sets, demonstrating its theoretical and empirical advantages over both spectral and density-based clustering",

We study the asymptotic behavior of the algorithm under the framework of learning theory. The contribution of this paper is two-fold.

Second, for the case $0 < q < 1$, we show that the regularization parameter plays a role as a trade-off between sparsity and convergence rates. Under some mild conditions, the fraction of non-zero coefficients in a local minimizer of the algorithm will tend to $0$ at a polynomial decay rate when the sample size $m$ becomes large.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer feature reduction method (TLFre) for SGL via a decomposition of its dual feasible set. The two-layer reduction is able to quickly identify the inactive groups and the inactive features, respectively, which are guaranteed to be absent from the sparse representation and can be removed from the optimization. Existing feature reduction methods are only applicable to sparse models with one sparsity-inducing regularizer. To our best knowledge, TLFre is the first one that is capable of dealing with multiple sparsity-inducing regularizers. Moreover, TLFre has a very low computational cost and can be integrated with any existing solvers.

Gaussian message passing applied to pairwise MGs is often labeled Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) and can be used to approximate the marginal of each variable contained in the pairwise MG. We propose a multivariate extension of GaBP (we label this GaBP-m) that can be used to estimate higher-dimensional marginals. Beyond the ability to estimate higher-dimensional marginals, GaBP-m exhibits better convergence behavior than GaBP, and can also provide more accurate univariate marginals. The theoretical results of this paper are based on an extension of the computation tree analysis conducted on univariate nodes to the multivariate case. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a convergence condition for GaBP-m that moves beyond the walk-summability of the precision matrix. Based on this convergence condition, we derived an upper bound for the number of iterations required for convergence of the GaBP-m algorithm. An upper bound on the dissimilarity between the approximate and exact marginal covariance matrices was established. We argue that GaBP-m is robust towards a certain change in variables, a property not shared by iterative solvers of linear systems, such as the conjugate gradient (CG) and preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods.

In practice this takes a wide variety of different forms, and among them \"coresets\" are especially appealing. A coreset is a (small) weighted sample of the original data that comes with the following guarantee: a cost function can be evaluated on the smaller set instead of the larger one, with low relative error. For some classes of problems, and via a careful choice of sampling distribution (based on the so-called \"sensitivity\" metric), iid random sampling has turned to be one of the most successful methods for building coresets efficiently. However, independent samples are sometimes overly redundant, and one could hope that enforcing diversity would lead to better performance. The difficulty lies in proving coreset properties in non-iid samples. We show that the coreset property holds for samples formed with determinantal point processes (DPP). DPPs are interesting because they are a rare example of repulsive point processes with tractable theoretical properties, enabling us to prove general coreset theorems. We apply our results to both the $k$-means and the linear regression problems, and give extensive empirical evidence that the small additional computational cost of DPP sampling comes with superior performance over its iid counterpart. Of independent interest, we also provide analytical formulas for the sensitivity in the linear regression and $1$-means cases",

We present a computationally efficient, rate optimal cluster tree estimator based on simple extensions of the popular DBSCAN algorithm of Ester et al. (1996). Our procedure relies on kernel density estimators and returns a sequence of nested random geometric graphs whose connected components form a hierarchy of clusters. The resulting optimal rates for cluster tree estimation depend on the degree of smoothness of the underlying density and, interestingly, match the minimax rates for density estimation under the sup-norm loss. Our results complement and extend the analysis of the DBSCAN algorithm in Sriperumbudur and Steinwart (2012).

    "title": "Optimization with Non-Differentiable Constraints with Applications to Fairness, Recall, Churn, and Other Goals",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We show that many machine learning goals can be expressed as \"rate constraints\" on a model's predictions. We study the problem of training non-convex models subject to these rate constraints (or other non-convex or non-differentiable constraints). In the non-convex setting, the standard approach of Lagrange multipliers may fail. Furthermore, if the constraints are non-differentiable, then one cannot optimize the Lagrangian with gradient-based methods. To solve these issues, we introduce a new \"proxy-Lagrangian\" formulation. This leads to an algorithm that, assuming access to an optimization oracle, produces a stochastic classifier by playing a two-player non-zero-sum game solving for what we call a semi-coarse correlated equilibrium, which in turn corresponds to an approximately optimal and feasible solution to the constrained optimization problem. We then give a procedure that shrinks the randomized solution down to a mixture of at most $m+1$ deterministic solutions, given $m$ constraints. This culminates in a procedure that can solve non-convex constrained optimization problems with possibly non-differentiable and non-convex constraints, and enjoys theoretical guarantees. We provide extensive experimental results covering a broad range of policy goals, including various fairness metrics, accuracy, coverage, recall, and churn",

    "title": "Fast Automatic Smoothing for Generalized Additive Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Generalized additive models (GAMs) are regression models wherein parameters of probability distributions depend on input variables through a sum of smooth functions, whose degrees of smoothness are selected by $L_2$ regularization. Such models have become the de-facto standard nonlinear regression models when interpretability and flexibility are required, but reliable and fast methods for automatic smoothing in large data sets are still lacking. We develop a general methodology for automatically learning the optimal degree of $L_2$ regularization for GAMs using an empirical Bayes approach. The smooth functions are penalized by hyper-parameters that are learned simultaneously by maximization of a marginal likelihood using an approximate expectation-maximization algorithm. The latter involves a double Laplace approximation at the E-step, and leads to an efficient M-step. Empirical analysis shows that the resulting algorithm is numerically stable, faster than the best existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. For illustration, we apply it to an important and challenging problem in the analysis of extremal data",

    "title": "Learning Overcomplete, Low Coherence Dictionaries with Linear Inference",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Finding overcomplete latent representations of data has applications in data analysis, signal processing, machine learning, theoretical neuroscience and many other fields. In an overcomplete representation, the number of latent features exceeds the data dimensionality, which is useful when the data is undersampled by the measurements (compressed sensing or information bottlenecks in neural systems) or composed from multiple complete sets of linear features, each spanning the data space. Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is a linear technique for learning sparse latent representations, which typically has a lower computational cost than sparse coding, a linear generative model which requires an iterative, nonlinear inference step. While well suited for finding complete representations, we show that overcompleteness poses a challenge to existing ICA algorithms. Specifically, the coherence control used in existing ICA and other dictionary learning algorithms, necessary to prevent the formation of duplicate dictionary features, is ill-suited in the overcomplete case. We show that in the overcomplete case, several existing ICA algorithms have undesirable global minima that maximize coherence. We provide a theoretical explanation of these failures and, based on the theory, propose improved coherence control costs for overcomplete ICA algorithms. Further, by comparing ICA algorithms to the computationally more expensive sparse coding on synthetic data, we show that the limited applicability of overcomplete, linear inference can be extended with the proposed cost functions. Finally, when trained on natural images, we show that the coherence control biases the exploration of the data manifold, sometimes yielding suboptimal, coherent solutions. All told, this study contributes new insights into and methods for coherence control for linear ICA, some of which are applicable to many other nonlinear models",

    "abstract": "With the growing importance of machine learning (ML) algorithms for practical applications, reducing data quality problems in ML pipelines has become a major focus of research. In many cases missing values can break data pipelines which makes completeness one of the most impactful data quality challenges. Current missing value imputation methods are focusing on numerical or categorical data and can be difficult to scale to datasets with millions of rows. We release DataWig, a robust and scalable approach for missing value imputation that can be applied to tables with heterogeneous data types, including unstructured text. DataWig combines deep learning feature extractors with automatic hyperparameter tuning. This enables users without a machine learning background, such as data engineers, to impute missing values with minimal effort in tables with more heterogeneous data types than supported in existing libraries, while requiring less glue code for feature engineering and offering more flexible modelling options. We demonstrate that DataWig compares favourably to existing imputation packages. Source code, documentation, and unit tests for this package are available at: https://github.com/awslabs/datawig",

    "abstract": "The classical convergence analysis of SGD is carried out under the assumption that the norm of the stochastic gradient is uniformly bounded. While this might hold for some loss functions, it is violated for cases where the objective function is strongly convex. In Bottou et al. (2018), a new analysis of convergence of SGD is performed under the assumption that stochastic gradients are bounded with respect to the true gradient norm. We show that for stochastic problems arising in machine learning such bound always holds; and we also propose an alternative convergence analysis of SGD with diminishing learning rate regime. We then move on to the asynchronous parallel setting, and prove convergence of Hogwild! algorithm in the same regime in the case of diminished learning rate. It is well-known that SGD converges if a sequence of learning rates $\\{\\eta_t\\}$ satisfies $\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\eta_t \\rightarrow \\infty$ and $\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\eta^2_t < \\infty$.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Variable importance (VI) tools describe how much covariates contribute to a prediction model's accuracy. However, important variables for one well-performing model (for example, a linear model $f(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbf{x}^{T}\\beta$ with a fixed coefficient vector $\\beta$) may be unimportant for another model. In this paper, we propose model class reliance (MCR) as the range of VI values across all well-performing model in a prespecified class. Thus, MCR gives a more comprehensive description of importance by accounting for the fact that many prediction models, possibly of different parametric forms, may fit the data well. In the process of deriving MCR, we show several informative results for permutation-based VI estimates, based on the VI measures used in Random Forests. Specifically, we derive connections between permutation importance estimates for a single prediction model, U-statistics, conditional variable importance, conditional causal effects, and linear model coefficients. We then give probabilistic bounds for MCR, using a novel, generalizable technique. We apply MCR to a public data set of Broward County criminal records to study the reliance of recidivism prediction models on sex and race. In this application, MCR can be used to help inform VI for unknown, proprietary models",

We extend the popular MNIST dataset by adding a morphometric analysis enabling quantitative comparison of trained models, identification of the roles of latent variables, and characterisation of sample diversity.

    "title": "Differentiable reservoir computing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Numerous results in learning and approximation theory have evidenced the importance of differentiability at the time of countering the curse of dimensionality. In the context of reservoir computing, much effort has been devoted in the last two decades to characterize the situations in which systems of this type exhibit the so-called echo state (ESP) and fading memory (FMP) properties. These important features amount, in mathematical terms, to the existence and continuity of global reservoir system solutions. That research is complemented in this paper with the characterization of the differentiability of reservoir filters for very general classes of discrete-time deterministic inputs. This constitutes a novel strong contribution to the long line of research on the ESP and the FMP and, in particular, links to existing research on the input-dependence of the ESP. Differentiability has been shown in the literature to be a key feature in the learning of attractors of chaotic dynamical systems. A Volterra-type series representation for reservoir filters with semi-infinite discrete-time inputs is constructed in the analytic case using Taylor's theorem and corresponding approximation bounds are provided. Finally, it is shown as a corollary of these results that any fading memory filter can be uniformly approximated by a finite Volterra series with finite memory",

    "abstract": "We unify kernel density estimation and empirical Bayes and address a set of problems in unsupervised machine learning with a geometric interpretation of those methods, rooted in the concentration of measure phenomenon. Kernel density is viewed symbolically as $X\\rightharpoonup Y$ where the random variable $X$ is smoothed to $Y= X+N(0,\\sigma^2 I_d)$, and empirical Bayes is the machinery to denoise in a least-squares sense, which we express as $X \\leftharpoondown Y$. A learning objective is derived by combining these two, symbolically captured by $X \\rightleftharpoons Y$. Crucially, instead of using the original nonparametric estimators, we parametrize the energy function with a neural network denoted by $\\phi$; at optimality, $\\nabla \\phi \\approx -\\nabla \\log f$ where $f$ is the density of $Y$. The optimization problem is abstracted as interactions of high-dimensional spheres which emerge due to the concentration of isotropic Gaussians.

However, model selection---even choosing the number of nodes---remains an open question. Poor choices can severely affect the quality of the produced uncertainties. In this paper, we explore continuous shrinkage priors, the horseshoe, and the regularized horseshoe distributions, for model selection in Bayesian neural networks. When placed over node pre-activations and coupled with appropriate variational approximations, we find that the strong shrinkage provided by the horseshoe is effective at turning off nodes that do not help explain the data. We demonstrate that our approach finds compact network structures even when the number of nodes required is grossly over-estimated. Moreover, the model selection over the number of nodes does not come at the expense of predictive or computational performance; in fact, we learn smaller networks with comparable predictive performance to current approaches.

The method draws samples by simulating a Markov chain obtained from the discretization of an appropriate Langevin diffusion, combined with an accept-reject step. Relative to known guarantees for the unadjusted Langevin algorithm (ULA), our bounds show that the use of an accept-reject step in MALA leads to an exponentially improved dependence on the error-tolerance. Concretely, in order to obtain samples with TV error at most $\\delta$ for a density with condition number $\\kappa$, we show that MALA requires $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa d \\log(1/\\delta) )$ steps from a warm start, as compared to the $\\mathcal{O} (\\kappa^2 d/\\delta^2 )$ steps established in past work on ULA.

Recently, several authors have shown that this is not the case: small translations or rescalings of the input image can drastically change the network's prediction. In this paper, we quantify this phenomena and ask why neither the convolutional architecture nor data augmentation are sufficient to achieve the desired invariance. Specifically, we show that the convolutional architecture does not give invariance since architectures ignore the classical sampling theorem, and data augmentation does not give invariance because the CNNs learn to be invariant to transformations only for images that are very similar to typical images from the training set. We discuss two possible solutions to this problem: (1) antialiasing the intermediate representations and (2) increasing data augmentation and show that they provide only a partial solution at best. Taken together, our results indicate that the problem of insuring invariance to small image transformations in neural networks while preserving high accuracy remains unsolved",
