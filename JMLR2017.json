    "abstract": "This paper presents the Averaged CVB (ACVB) inference and offers convergence-guaranteed and practically useful fast Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB) inferences. CVB inferences yield more precise inferences of Bayesian probabilistic models than Variational Bayes (VB) inferences. However, their convergence aspect is fairly unknown and has not been scrutinized. To make CVB more useful, we study their convergence behaviors in a empirical and practical approach. We develop a convergence- guaranteed algorithm for any CVB-based inference called ACVB, which enables automatic convergence detection and frees non- expert practitioners from the difficult and costly manual monitoring of inference processes. In experiments, ACVB inferences are comparable to or better than those of existing inference methods and deterministic, fast, and provide easier convergence detection. These features are especially convenient for practitioners who want precise Bayesian inference with assured convergence",

    "title": "Scalable Influence Maximization for Multiple Products in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A typical viral marketing model identifies influential users in a social network to maximize a single product adoption assuming unlimited user attention, campaign budgets, and time. In reality, multiple products need campaigns, users have limited attention, convincing users incurs costs, and advertisers have limited budgets and expect the adoptions to be maximized soon. Facing these user, monetary, and timing constraints, we formulate the problem as a submodular maximization task in a continuous-time diffusion model under the intersection of one matroid and multiple knapsack constraints. We propose a randomized algorithm estimating the user influence (Partial results in the paper on influence estimation have been published in a conference paper: Nan Du, Le Song, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez, and Hongyuan Zha. Scalable influence estimation in continuous time diffusion networks. In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 26, 2013.) in a network ($|\\mathcal{V}|$ nodes, $|\\mathcal{E}|$ edges) to an accuracy of $\\epsilon$ with $n=\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ randomizations and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n|\\mathcal{E}|+n|\\mathcal{V}|)$ computations. By exploiting the influence estimation algorithm as a subroutine, we develop an adaptive threshold greedy algorithm achieving an approximation factor $k_a/(2+2 k)$ of the optimal when $k_a$ out of the $k$ knapsack constraints are active. Extensive experiments on networks of millions of nodes demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve the state-of- the-art in terms of effectiveness and scalability",

Local changes are desirable because in practice edits of other parts of the clustering are considered churn - changes that are perceived as quality-neutral or quality-negative.

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have drawn interest from machine learning researchers because of their effectiveness at preserving past inputs for time-varying data processing tasks. To understand the success and limitations of RNNs, it is critical that we advance our analysis of their fundamental memory properties. We focus on echo state networks (ESNs), which are RNNs with simple memoryless nodes and random connectivity. In most existing analyses, the short-term memory (STM) capacity results conclude that the ESN network size must scale linearly with the input size for unstructured inputs. The main contribution of this paper is to provide general results characterizing the STM capacity for linear ESNs with multidimensional input streams when the inputs have common low- dimensional structure: sparsity in a basis or significant statistical dependence between inputs. In both cases, we show that the number of nodes in the network must scale linearly with the information rate and poly-logarithmically with the input dimension. The analysis relies on advanced applications of random matrix theory and results in explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the recovery error. Taken together, this analysis provides a significant step forward in our understanding of the STM properties in RNNs",

One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite- dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs",

The answer is yes: under certain conditions on the prior, sampling from the posterior distribution can lead to a desired level of privacy and utility. For a uniform treatment, we define differential privacy over arbitrary data set metrics, outcome spaces and distribution families. This allows us to also deal with non-i.i.d or non-tabular data sets. We then prove bounds on the sensitivity of the posterior to the data, which delivers a measure of robustness. We also show how to use posterior sampling to provide differentially private responses to queries, within a decision-theoretic framework. Finally, we provide bounds on the utility of answers to queries and on the ability of an adversary to distinguish between data sets. The latter are complemented by a novel use of Le Cam's method to obtain lower bounds on distinguishability. Our results hold for arbitrary metrics, including those for the common definition of differential privacy. For specific choices of the metric, we give a number of examples satisfying our assumptions",

This paper presents the results of an extensive empirical evaluation of resampling procedures for SVM hyperparameter selection, designed to address this gap in the machine learning literature. We tested 15 different resampling procedures on 121 binary classification data sets in order to select the best SVM hyperparameters. We used three very different statistical procedures to analyse the results: the standard multi- classifier/multi-data set procedure proposed by Dem\\v{s}ar, the confidence intervals on the excess loss of each procedure in relation to 5-fold cross validation, and the Bayes factor analysis proposed by Barber. We conclude that a 2-fold procedure is appropriate to select the hyperparameters of an SVM for data sets for 1000 or more datapoints, while a 3-fold procedure is appropriate for smaller data sets",

To achieve a good prediction performance, it is important to find a suitable model for a given dataset. However, it is often time consuming and impractical for practitioners to try various classification models because each model employs a different formulation and algorithm. The difficulty can be mitigated if we have a unified formulation and an efficient universal algorithmic framework for various classification models to expedite the comparison of performance of different models for a given dataset. In this paper, we present a unified formulation of various classification models (including $C$-SVM, $\\ell_2$-SVM, $\\nu$-SVM, MM-FDA, MM-MPM, logistic regression, distance weighted discrimination) and develop a general optimization algorithm based on an accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method for the formulation. We design various techniques such as backtracking line search and adaptive restarting strategy in order to speed up the practical convergence of our method. We also give a theoretical convergence guarantee for the proposed fast APG algorithm. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is stable and highly competitive to specialized algorithms designed for specific models (e.g., sequential minimal optimization (SMO) for SVM)",

By letting the number of hidden units grow unbounded and using classical non-Euclidean regularization tools on the output weights, they lead to a convex optimization problem and we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of their generalization performance, with a study of both the approximation and the estimation errors. We show in particular that they are adaptive to unknown underlying linear structures, such as the dependence on the projection of the input variables onto a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, when using sparsity- inducing norms on the input weights, we show that high- dimensional non-linear variable selection may be achieved, without any strong assumption regarding the data and with a total number of variables potentially exponential in the number of observations. However, solving this convex optimization problem in infinite dimensions is only possible if the non- convex subproblem of addition of a new unit can be solved efficiently. We provide a simple geometric interpretation for our choice of activation functions and describe simple conditions for convex relaxations of the finite-dimensional non- convex subproblem to achieve the same generalization error bounds, even when constant-factor approximations cannot be found. We were not able to find strong enough convex relaxations to obtain provably polynomial-time algorithms and leave open the existence or non-existence of such tractable algorithms with non-exponential sample complexities",

    "abstract": "Scaling kernel machines to massive data sets is a major challenge due to storage and computation issues in handling large kernel matrices, that are usually dense. Recently, many papers have suggested tackling this problem by using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. In this paper, we first make the observation that the structure of shift-invariant kernels changes from low-rank to block-diagonal (without any low-rank structure) when varying the scale parameter. Based on this observation, we propose a new kernel approximation framework -- Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix. We show that the resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank kernel approximation methods in terms of speed, approximation error, and memory usage. As an example, on the covtype dataset with half a million samples, MEKA takes around 70 seconds and uses less than 80 MB memory on a single machine to achieve 10% relative approximation error, while standard Nystr√É¬∂m approximation is about 6 times slower and uses more than 400MB memory to achieve similar approximation. We also present extensive experiments on applying MEKA to speed up kernel ridge regression",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We show that kernel-based quadrature rules for computing integrals can be seen as a special case of random feature expansions for positive definite kernels, for a particular decomposition that always exists for such kernels. We provide a theoretical analysis of the number of required samples for a given approximation error, leading to both upper and lower bounds that are based solely on the eigenvalues of the associated integral operator and match up to logarithmic terms. In particular, we show that the upper bound may be obtained from independent and identically distributed samples from a specific non-uniform distribution, while the lower bound if valid for any set of points. Applying our results to kernel-based quadrature, while our results are fairly general, we recover known upper and lower bounds for the special cases of Sobolev spaces. Moreover, our results extend to the more general problem of full function approximations (beyond simply computing an integral), with results in $L_2$- and $L_\\infty$-norm that match known results for special cases. Applying our results to random features, we show an improvement of the number of random features needed to preserve the generalization guarantees for learning with Lipshitz-continuous losses",

Finding the CP decomposition of an overcomplete tensor is NP-hard in general. We consider the case where the tensor components are randomly drawn, and show that the simple power iteration recovers the components with bounded error under mild initialization conditions. We apply our analysis to unsupervised learning of latent variable models, such as multi-view mixture models and spherical Gaussian mixtures. Given the third order moment tensor, we learn the parameters using tensor power iterations. We prove it can correctly learn the model parameters when the number of hidden components $k$ is much larger than the data dimension $d$, up to $k = o(d^{1.5})$. We initialize the power iterations with data samples and prove its success under mild conditions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the samples. Our analysis significantly expands the class of latent variable models where spectral methods are applicable. Our analysis also deals with noise in the input tensor leading to sample complexity result in the application to learning latent variable models",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Factor Analysis (FA) is a technique of fundamental importance that is widely used in classical and modern multivariate statistics, psychometrics, and econometrics. In this paper, we revisit the classical rank-constrained FA problem which seeks to approximate an observed covariance matrix ($\\B\\Sigma$) by the sum of a Positive Semidefinite (PSD) low-rank component ($\\B\\Theta$) and a diagonal matrix ($\\B\\Phi$) (with nonnegative entries) subject to $\\B\\Sigma - \\B\\Phi$ being PSD. We propose a flexible family of rank-constrained, nonlinear Semidefinite Optimization based formulations for this task. We introduce a reformulation of the problem as a smooth optimization problem with convex, compact constraints and propose a unified algorithmic framework, utilizing state of the art techniques in nonlinear optimization to obtain high-quality feasible solutions for our proposed formulation. At the same time, by using a variety of techniques from discrete and global optimization, we show that these solutions are certifiably optimal in many cases, even for problems with thousands of variables. Our techniques are general and make no assumption on the underlying problem data. The estimator proposed herein aids statistical interpretability and provides computational scalability and significantly improved accuracy when compared to current, publicly available popular methods for rank-constrained FA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal on an array of synthetic and real-life datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates how a previously intractable rank-constrained optimization problem can be solved to provable optimality by coupling developments in convex analysis and in global and discrete optimization",

In the algorithmic aspect, we apply the well-known proximal gradient method to solve the $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization problems, either by analytically solving some specific $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization subproblems, or by using the Newton method to solve general $\\ell_{p,q}$ regularization subproblems. In particular, we establish a local linear convergence rate of the proximal gradient method for solving the $\\ell_{1,q}$ regularization problem under some mild conditions and by first proving a second-order growth condition. As a consequence, the local linear convergence rate of proximal gradient method for solving the usual $\\ell_{q}$ regularization problem ($0<q<1$) is obtained.

There is a gap between the underlying theory and the motivation of its usage in practice. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap and provide a rigorous framework for analyzing existing FIR-based active learning methods. In particular, we show that FIR can be asymptotically viewed as an upper bound of the expected variance of the log-likelihood ratio. Additionally, our analysis suggests a unifying framework that not only enables us to make theoretical comparisons among the existing querying methods based on FIR, but also allows us to give insight into the development of new active learning approaches based on this objective",

Our claim of near-optimality holds in both computational and statistical senses. When the sample has radius $R$ and margin $\\gamma$, we show that it can be compressed down to roughly $d=(R/\\gamma)^{\\text{dens}}$ points, and further that finding a significantly better compression is algorithmically intractable unless P=NP.

    "title": "Learning Local Dependence In Ordered Data",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In many applications, data come with a natural ordering. This ordering can often induce local dependence among nearby variables. However, in complex data, the width of this dependence may vary, making simple assumptions such as a constant neighborhood size unrealistic. We propose a framework for learning this local dependence based on estimating the inverse of the Cholesky factor of the covariance matrix. Penalized maximum likelihood estimation of this matrix yields a simple regression interpretation for local dependence in which variables are predicted by their neighbors. Our proposed method involves solving a convex, penalized Gaussian likelihood problem with a hierarchical group lasso penalty. The problem decomposes into independent subproblems which can be solved efficiently in parallel using first-order methods. Our method yields a sparse, symmetric, positive definite estimator of the precision matrix, encoding a Gaussian graphical model. We derive theoretical results not found in existing methods attaining this structure. In particular, our conditions for signed support recovery and estimation consistency rates in multiple norms are as mild as those in a regression problem. Empirical results show our method performing favorably compared to existing methods. We apply our method to genomic data to flexibly model linkage disequilibrium. Our method is also applied to improve the performance of discriminant analysis in sound recording classification",

    "title": "Bayesian Learning of Dynamic Multilayer Networks",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A plethora of networks is being collected in a growing number of fields, including disease transmission, international relations, social interactions, and others. As data streams continue to grow, the complexity associated with these highly multidimensional connectivity data presents novel challenges. In this paper, we focus on the time-varying interconnections among a set of actors in multiple contexts, called layers. Current literature lacks flexible statistical models for dynamic multilayer networks, which can enhance quality in inference and prediction by efficiently borrowing information within each network, across time, and between layers. Motivated by this gap, we develop a Bayesian nonparametric model leveraging latent space representations. Our formulation characterizes the edge probabilities as a function of shared and layer-specific actors positions in a latent space, with these positions changing in time via Gaussian processes. This representation facilitates dimensionality reduction and incorporates different sources of information in the observed data. In addition, we obtain tractable procedures for posterior computation, inference, and prediction. We provide theoretical results on the flexibility of our model. Our methods are tested on simulations and infection studies monitoring dynamic face-to-face contacts among individuals in multiple days, where we perform better than current methods in inference and prediction",

    "abstract": "For spiked population model, we investigate the large dimension $N$ and large sample size $M$ asymptotic behavior of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method in the limit of $N,M\\rightarrow\\infty$ at fixed $\\alpha=M/N$. We focus on the generalization performance by analytically evaluating the angle between the normal direction vectors of SVM separating hyperplane and corresponding Bayes optimal separating hyperplane. This is an analogous result to the one shown in Paul (2007) and Nadler (2008) for the angle between the sample eigenvector and the population eigenvector in random matrix theorem. We provide not just bound, but sharp prediction of the asymptotic behavior of SVM that can be determined by a set of nonlinear equations. Based on the analytical results, we propose a new method of selecting tuning parameter which significantly reduces the computational cost. A surprising finding is that SVM achieves its best performance at small value of the tuning parameter under spiked population model. These results are confirmed to be correct by comparing with those of numerical simulations on finite-size systems.

    "title": "Distributed Semi-supervised Learning with Kernel Ridge Regression",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper provides error analysis for distributed semi- supervised learning with kernel ridge regression (DSKRR) based on a divide-and-conquer strategy. DSKRR applies kernel ridge regression (KRR) to data subsets that are distributively stored on multiple servers to produce individual output functions, and then takes a weighted average of the individual output functions as a final estimator. Using a novel error decomposition which divides the generalization error of DSKRR into the approximation error, sample error and distributed error, we find that the sample error and distributed error reflect the power and limitation of DSKRR, compared with KRR processing the whole data. Thus a small distributed error provides a large range of the number of data subsets to guarantee a small generalization error. Our results show that unlabeled data play important roles in reducing the distributed error and enlarging the number of data subsets in DSKRR. Our analysis also applies to the case when the regression function is out of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Numerical experiments including toy simulations and a music-prediction task are employed to demonstrate our theoretical statements and show the power of unlabeled data in distributed learning",

    "title": "On Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for tall data",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number $n$ of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the Metropolis- Hastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach relying on a control variate method which samples under regularity conditions from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than $O(n)$ data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we emphasize that we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor",

    "title": "Explaining the Success of AdaBoost and Random Forests as Interpolating Classifiers",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "There is a large literature explaining why AdaBoost is a successful classifier. The literature on AdaBoost focuses on classifier margins and boosting's interpretation as the optimization of an exponential likelihood function. These existing explanations, however, have been pointed out to be incomplete. A random forest is another popular ensemble method for which there is substantially less explanation in the literature. We introduce a novel perspective on AdaBoost and random forests that proposes that the two algorithms work for similar reasons. While both classifiers achieve similar predictive accuracy, random forests cannot be conceived as a direct optimization procedure. Rather, random forests is a self- averaging, interpolating algorithm which creates what we denote as a spiked-smooth classifier, and we view AdaBoost in the same light. We conjecture that both AdaBoost and random forests succeed because of this mechanism. We provide a number of examples to support this explanation. In the process, we question the conventional wisdom that suggests that boosting algorithms for classification require regularization or early stopping and should be limited to low complexity classes of learners, such as decision stumps. We conclude that boosting should be used like random forests: with large decision trees, without regularization or early stopping",

    "title": "Uniform Hypergraph Partitioning: Provable Tensor Methods and Sampling Techniques",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In a series of recent works, we have generalised the consistency results in the stochastic block model literature to the case of uniform and non-uniform hypergraphs. The present paper continues the same line of study, where we focus on partitioning weighted uniform hypergraphs---a problem often encountered in computer vision. This work is motivated by two issues that arise when a hypergraph partitioning approach is used to tackle computer vision problems: (i) The uniform hypergraphs constructed for higher-order learning contain all edges, but most have negligible weights. Thus, the adjacency tensor is nearly sparse, and yet, not binary. (ii) A more serious concern is that standard partitioning algorithms need to compute all edge weights, which is computationally expensive for hypergraphs. This is usually resolved in practice by merging the clustering algorithm with a tensor sampling strategy---an approach that is yet to be analysed rigorously. We build on our earlier work on partitioning dense unweighted uniform hypergraphs (Ghoshdastidar and Dukkipati, ICML, 2015), and address the aforementioned issues by proposing provable and efficient partitioning algorithms. Our analysis justifies the empirical success of practical sampling techniques. We also complement our theoretical findings by elaborate empirical comparison of various hypergraph partitioning schemes",

    "title": "On the Consistency of Ordinal Regression Methods",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many of the ordinal regression models that have been proposed in the literature can be seen as methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the zero-one, absolute, or squared loss functions. A key property that allows to study the statistical implications of such approximations is that of Fisher consistency. Fisher consistency is a desirable property for surrogate loss functions and implies that in the population setting, i.e., if the probability distribution that generates the data were available, then optimization of the surrogate would yield the best possible model. In this paper we will characterize the Fisher consistency of a rich family of surrogate loss functions used in the context of ordinal regression, including support vector ordinal regression, ORBoosting and least absolute deviation. We will see that, for a family of surrogate loss functions that subsumes support vector ordinal regression and ORBoosting, consistency can be fully characterized by the derivative of a real-valued function at zero, as happens for convex margin-based surrogates in binary classification. We also derive excess risk bounds for a surrogate of the absolute error that generalize existing risk bounds for binary classification. Finally, our analysis suggests a novel surrogate of the squared error loss. We compare this novel surrogate with competing approaches on 9 different datasets. Our method shows to be highly competitive in practice, outperforming the least squares loss on 7 out of 9 datasets",

A naive calculation of the normalization constant of the probabilistic model on discrete space is often infeasible and statistical inference based on such probabilistic models has difficulty. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for probabilistic models on discrete space, which is derived from an empirically localized homogeneous divergence. The idea of the empirical localization makes it possible to ignore an unobserved domain on sample space, and the homogeneous divergence is a discrepancy measure between two positive measures and has a weak coincidence axiom. The proposed estimator can be constructed without calculating the normalization constant and is asymptotically consistent and Fisher efficient. We investigate statistical properties of the proposed estimator and reveal a relationship between the empirically localized homogeneous divergence and a mixture of the $\\alpha$-divergence. The $\\alpha$-divergence is a non- homogeneous discrepancy measure that is frequently discussed in the context of information geometry. Using the relationship, we also propose an asymptotically consistent estimator of the normalization constant.

Motivated by this approximation property, the paper addresses the question of estimating an unknown density $p_0$ through an element in $\\mathcal{P}$. Standard techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) or pseudo MLE (based on the method of sieves), which are based on minimizing the KL divergence between $p_0$ and $\\mathcal{P}$, do not yield practically useful estimators because of their inability to efficiently handle the log-partition function. We propose an estimator $\\hat{p}_n$ based on minimizing the Fisher divergence, $J(p_0\\Vert p)$ between $p_0$ and $p\\in \\mathcal{P}$, which involves solving a simple finite-dimensional linear system. When $p_0\\in\\mathcal{P}$, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent, and provide a convergence rate of $n^{-\\min\\left\\{\\frac{2}{3},\\frac{2\\beta+1}{2\\beta+2}\\right\\}}$ in Fisher divergence under the smoothness assumption that $\\log p_0\\in\\mathcal{R}(C^\\beta)$ for some $\\beta\\ge 0$, where $C$ is a certain Hilbert-Schmidt operator on $\\mathcal{H}$ and $\\mathcal{R}(C^\\beta)$ denotes the image of $C^\\beta$.

By ordinal distance information we refer to binary answers to distance comparisons such as $d(A,B)<d(C,D)$. For many problems in machine learning and statistics it is unclear how to solve them in such a scenario. Up to now, the main approach is to explicitly construct an ordinal embedding of the data points in the Euclidean space, an approach that has a number of drawbacks. In this paper, we propose algorithms for the problems of medoid estimation, outlier identification, classification, and clustering when given only ordinal data. They are based on estimating the lens depth function and the $k$-relative neighborhood graph on a data set. Our algorithms are simple, are much faster than an ordinal embedding approach and avoid some of its drawbacks, and can easily be parallelized",

    "abstract": "Our work in this paper is inspired by a statistical observation that is both elementary and broadly relevant to network analysis in practice---that the uncertainty in approximating some true graph $G=(V,E)$ by some estimated graph $\\hat{G}=(V,\\hat{E})$ manifests as errors in our knowledge of the presence/absence of edges between vertex pairs, which must necessarily propagate to any estimates of network summaries $\\eta(G)$ we seek. Motivated by the common practice of using plug-in estimates $\\eta(\\hat{G})$ as proxies for $\\eta(G)$, our focus is on the problem of characterizing the distribution of the discrepancy $D=\\eta(\\hat{G}) - \\eta(G)$, in the case where $\\eta(\\cdot)$ is a subgraph count. Specifically, we study the fundamental case where the statistic of interest is $|E|$, the number of edges in $G$. Our primary contribution in this paper is to show that in the empirically relevant setting of large graphs with low-rate measurement errors, the distribution of $D_E=|\\hat{E}| - |E|$ is well-characterized by a Skellam distribution, when the errors are independent or weakly dependent. Under an assumption of independent errors, we are able to further show conditions under which this characterization is strictly better than that of an appropriate normal distribution. These results derive from our formulation of a general result, quantifying the accuracy with which the difference of two sums of dependent Bernoulli random variables may be approximated by the difference of two independent Poisson random variables, i.e., by a Skellam distribution. This general result is developed through the use of Stein's method, and may be of some general interest. We finish with a discussion of possible extension of our work to subgraph counts $\\eta(G)$ of higher order",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We introduce a novel approach for estimating Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) parameters from collapsed Gibbs samples (CGS), by leveraging the full conditional distributions over the latent variable assignments to efficiently average over multiple samples, for little more computational cost than drawing a single additional collapsed Gibbs sample. Our approach can be understood as adapting the soft clustering methodology of Collapsed Variational Bayes (CVB0) to CGS parameter estimation, in order to get the best of both techniques. Our estimators can straightforwardly be applied to the output of any existing implementation of CGS, including modern accelerated variants. We perform extensive empirical comparisons of our estimators with those of standard collapsed inference algorithms on real-world data for both unsupervised LDA and Prior-LDA, a supervised variant of LDA for multi-label classification. Our results show a consistent advantage of our approach over traditional CGS under all experimental conditions, and over CVB0 inference in the majority of conditions. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of averaging over multiple samples in LDA parameter estimation, and the use of efficient computational techniques to do so",

    "title": "Fundamental Conditions for Low-CP-Rank Tensor Completion",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of low canonical polyadic (CP) rank tensor completion. A completion is a tensor whose entries agree with the observed entries and its rank matches the given CP rank. We analyze the manifold structure corresponding to the tensors with the given rank and define a set of polynomials based on the sampling pattern and CP decomposition. Then, we show that finite completability of the sampled tensor is equivalent to having a certain number of algebraically independent polynomials among the defined polynomials. Our proposed approach results in characterizing the maximum number of algebraically independent polynomials in terms of a simple geometric structure of the sampling pattern, and therefore we obtain the deterministic necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for finite completability of the sampled tensor. Moreover, assuming that the entries of the tensor are sampled independently with probability $p$ and using the mentioned deterministic analysis, we propose a combinatorial method to derive a lower bound on the sampling probability $p$, or equivalently, the number of sampled entries that guarantees finite completability with high probability. We also show that the existing result for the matrix completion problem can be used to obtain a loose lower bound on the sampling probability $p$. In addition, we obtain deterministic and probabilistic conditions for unique completability. It is seen that the number of samples required for finite or unique completability obtained by the proposed analysis on the CP manifold is orders-of- magnitude lower than that is obtained by the existing analysis on the Grassmannian manifold",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In machine learning, one often encounters data sets where a general pattern is violated by a relatively small number of exceptions (for example, a rule that says that all birds can fly is violated by examples such as penguins). This complicates the concept learning process and may lead to the rejection of some simple and expressive rules that cover many cases. In this paper we present an approach to this problem in description logic learning by computing partial descriptions (which are not necessarily entirely complete) of both positive and negative examples and combining them. Our Symmetric Parallel Class Expression Learning approach enables the generation of general rules with exception patterns included. We demonstrate that this algorithm provides significantly better results (in terms of metrics such as accuracy, search space covered, and learning time) than standard approaches on some typical data sets. Further, the approach has the added benefit that it can be parallelised relatively simply, leading to much faster exploration of the search tree on modern computers",

    "title": "Learning Partial Policies to Speedup MDP Tree Search via Reduction to I.I.D. Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A popular approach for online decision-making in large MDPs is time-bounded tree search. The effectiveness of tree search, however, is largely influenced by the action branching factor, which limits the search depth given a time bound. An obvious way to reduce action branching is to consider only a subset of potentially good actions at each state as specified by a provided partial policy. In this work, we consider offline learning of such partial policies with the goal of speeding up search without significantly reducing decision-making quality. Our first contribution consists of reducing the learning problem to set learning. We give a reduction-style analysis of three such algorithms, each making different assumptions, which relates the set learning objectives to the sub-optimality of search using the learned partial policies. Our second contribution is to describe concrete implementations of the algorithms within the popular framework of Monte-Carlo tree search. Finally, the third contribution is to evaluate the learning algorithms on two challenging MDPs with large action branching factors. The results show that the learned partial policies can significantly improve the anytime performance of Monte-Carlo tree search",

The proposed kernel is defined based on a hierarchical partitioning of the underlying data domain, where the Nystr√É¬∂m method (a globally low-rank approximation) is married with a locally lossless approximation in a hierarchical fashion. The kernel maintains (strict) positive-definiteness. The corresponding kernel matrix admits a recursively off- diagonal low-rank structure, which allows for fast linear algebra computations. Suppressing the factor of data dimension, the memory and arithmetic complexities for training a regression or a classifier are reduced from $O(n^2)$ and $O(n^3)$ to $O(nr)$ and $O(nr^2)$, respectively, where $n$ is the number of training examples and $r$ is the rank on each level of the hierarchy. Although other randomized approximate kernels entail a similar complexity, empirical results show that the proposed kernel achieves a matching performance with a smaller $r$. We demonstrate comprehensive experiments to show the effective use of the proposed kernel on data sizes up to the order of millions",

These penalized estimators have the square root of the residual sum of squared errors as loss function, and any weakly decomposable norm as penalty function. This fit measure is chosen because of its property that the estimator does not depend on the unknown standard deviation of the noise. On the other hand, a generalized weakly decomposable norm penalty is very useful in being able to deal with different underlying sparsity structures. We can choose a different sparsity inducing norm depending on how we want to interpret the unknown parameter vector $\\beta$. Structured sparsity norms, as defined in Micchelli et al. (2010), are special cases of weakly decomposable norms, therefore we also include the square root LASSO (Belloni et al., 2011), the group square root LASSO (Bunea et al., 2014) and a new method called the square root SLOPE (in a similar fashion to the SLOPE from Bogdan et al. 2015). For this collection of estimators our results provide sharp oracle inequalities with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. We discuss some examples of estimators.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we show that the popular C-SVM, soft-margin support vector classifier is equivalent to minimization of Buffered Probability of Exceedance (bPOE), a recently introduced characterization of uncertainty. To show this, we introduce a new SVM formulation, called the EC-SVM, which is derived from a simple bPOE minimization problem that is easy to interpret with a meaningful free parameter, optimal objective value, and probabilistic derivation. Over the range of its free parameter, the EC-SVM has both a convex and non-convex case which we connect to existing SVM formulations. We first show that the C-SVM, formulated with any regularization norm, is equivalent to the convex EC-SVM. Similarly, we show that the E$\\nu$-SVM is equivalent to the EC-SVM over its entire parameter range, which includes both the convex and non-convex case. These equivalences, coupled with the interpretability of the EC-SVM, allow us to gain surprising new insights into the C-SVM and fully connect soft margin support vector classification with superquantile and bPOE concepts. We also show that the EC-SVM can easily be cast as a robust optimization problem, where bPOE is minimized with data lying in a fixed uncertainty set. This reformulation allows us to clearly differentiate between the convex and non-convex case, with convexity associated with pessimistic views of uncertainty and non-convexity associated with optimistic views of uncertainty. Finally, we address some practical considerations. First, we show that these new insights can assist in making parameter selection more efficient. Second, we discuss optimization approaches for solving the EC-SVM. Third, we address the issue of generalization, providing generalization bounds for both bPOE and misclassification rate",

    "abstract": "Approximate inference in high-dimensional, discrete probabilistic models is a central problem in computational statistics and machine learning. This paper describes discrete particle variational inference (DPVI), a new approach that combines key strengths of Monte Carlo, variational and search- based techniques. DPVI is based on a novel family of particle- based variational approximations that can be fit using simple, fast, deterministic search techniques. Like Monte Carlo, DPVI can handle multiple modes, and yields exact results in a well- defined limit. Like unstructured mean-field, DPVI is based on optimizing a lower bound on the partition function; when this quantity is not of intrinsic interest, it facilitates convergence assessment and debugging. Like both Monte Carlo and combinatorial search, DPVI can take advantage of factorization, sequential structure, and custom search operators. This paper defines DPVI particle-based approximation family and partition function lower bounds, along with the sequential DPVI and local DPVI algorithm templates for optimizing them. DPVI is illustrated and evaluated via experiments on lattice Markov Random Fields, nonparametric Bayesian mixtures and block-models, and parametric as well as non-parametric hidden Markov models. Results include applications to real-world spike-sorting and relational modeling problems, and show that DPVI can offer appealing time/accuracy trade-offs as compared to multiple alternatives",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In many applications, not all the features used to represent data samples are important. Often only a few features are relevant for the prediction task. The choice of dependence measures often affect the final result of many feature selection methods. To select features that have complex nonlinear relationships with the response variable, the dependence measure should be equitable, a concept proposed by Reshef et al. (2011); that is, the dependence measure treats linear and nonlinear relationships equally. Recently, Kinney and Atwal (2014) gave a mathematical definition of self- equitability. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of robust-equitability and identify a robust- equitable copula dependence measure, the robust copula dependence (RCD) measure. RCD is based on the $L_1$-distance of the copula density from uniform and we show that it is equitable under both equitability definitions. We also prove theoretically that RCD is much easier to estimate than mutual information. Because of these theoretical properties, the RCD measure has the following advantages compared to existing dependence measures: it is robust to different relationship forms and robust to unequal sample sizes of different features. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets confirm the theoretical analysis, and illustrate the advantage of using the dependence measure RCD for feature selection",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a multiscale approach to efficiently compute approximate optimal transport plans between point sets. It is particularly well-suited for point sets that are in high- dimensions, but are close to being intrinsically low- dimensional. The approach is based on an adaptive multiscale decomposition of the point sets. The multiscale decomposition yields a sequence of optimal transport problems, that are solved in a top-to-bottom fashion from the coarsest to the finest scale. We provide numerical evidence that this multiscale approach scales approximately linearly, in time and memory, in the number of nodes, instead of quadratically or worse for a direct solution. Empirically, the multiscale approach results in less than one percent relative error in the objective function. Furthermore, the multiscale plans constructed are of interest by themselves as they may be used to introduce novel features and notions of distances between point sets. An analysis of sets of brain MRI based on optimal transport distances illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on a real world data set. The application demonstrates that multiscale optimal transport distances have the potential to improve on state-of-the-art metrics currently used in computational anatomy",

Non-parametric methods that approximate values functions or transition models can address this problem, by adapting to the complexity of the data set. Yet, many current non-parametric approaches rely on unstable greedy maximization of approximate value functions, which might lead to poor convergence or oscillations in the policy update. A more robust policy update can be obtained by limiting the information loss between successive state-action distributions. In this paper, we develop a policy search algorithm with policy updates that are both robust and non-parametric. Our method can learn non- parametric control policies for infinite horizon continuous Markov decision processes with non-linear and redundant sensory representations. We investigate how we can use approximations of the kernel function to reduce the time requirements of the demanding non-parametric computations. In our experiments, we show the strong performance of the proposed method, and how it can be approximated efficiently.

The closely related problem of testing serial independence of a multivariate stationary sequence is also considered. The M√É¬∂bius transformation of characteristic functions is used to characterize independence. A generalization to $p$ vectors of distance covariance and Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion ($HSIC$) tests with the translation invariant kernel of a stable probability distribution is proposed. Both test statistics can be expressed in a simple form as a sum over all elements of a componentwise product of $p$ doubly-centered matrices. It is shown that an $HSIC$ statistic with sufficiently small scale parameters is equivalent to a distance covariance statistic. Consistency and weak convergence of both types of statistics are established. Approximation of $p$-values is made by randomization tests without recomputing interpoint distances for each randomized sample. The dependogram is adapted to the proposed tests for the graphical identification of sources of dependencies.

The measure quantifies the heterogeneity of the correlations and is defined as the distance between a correlation matrix and the nearest correlation matrix with constant off-diagonal entries. This non-parametric notion generalizes existing test statistics for equality of correlation coefficients by allowing for alternative distance metrics, such as the Bures and other distances from quantum information theory. For several distance and dissimilarity metrics, we derive closed-form expressions of informativeness, which can be applied as objective functions for machine learning applications. Empirically, we demonstrate that informativeness is a useful criterion for selecting kernel parameters, choosing the dimension for kernel-based nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and identifying structured graphs. We also consider the problem of finding a maximally informative correlation matrix around a target matrix, and explore parameterizing the optimization in terms of the coordinates of the sample or through a lower-dimensional embedding. In the latter case, we find that maximizing the Bures-based informativeness measure, which is maximal for centered rank-1 correlation matrices, is equivalent to minimizing a specific matrix norm, and present an algorithm to solve the minimization problem using the norm's proximal operator. The proposed correlation denoising algorithm consistently improves spectral clustering. Overall, we find informativeness to be a novel and useful criterion for identifying non-trivial correlation structure",

    "title": "Relational Reinforcement Learning for Planning with Exogenous Effects",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Probabilistic planners have improved recently to the point that they can solve difficult tasks with complex and expressive models. In contrast, learners cannot tackle yet the expressive models that planners do, which forces complex models to be mostly handcrafted. We propose a new learning approach that can learn relational probabilistic models with both action effects and exogenous effects. The proposed learning approach combines a multi-valued variant of inductive logic programming for the generation of candidate models, with an optimization method to select the best set of planning operators to model a problem. We also show how to combine this learner with reinforcement learning algorithms to solve complete problems. Finally, experimental validation is provided that shows improvements over previous work in both simulation and a robotic task. The robotic task involves a dynamic scenario with several agents where a manipulator robot has to clear the tableware on a table. We show that the exogenous effects learned by our approach allowed the robot to clear the table in a more efficient way",

    "abstract": "Clustering high-dimensional data often requires some form of dimensionality reduction, where clustered variables are separated from noise-looking variables. We cast this problem as finding a low-dimensional projection of the data which is well-clustered. This yields a one-dimensional projection in the simplest situation with two clusters, and extends naturally to a multi-label scenario for more than two clusters. In this paper, (a) we first show that this joint clustering and dimension reduction formulation is equivalent to previously proposed discriminative clustering frameworks, thus leading to convex relaxations of the problem; (b) we propose a novel sparse extension, which is still cast as a convex relaxation and allows estimation in higher dimensions; (c) we propose a natural extension for the multi-label scenario; (d) we provide a new theoretical analysis of the performance of these formulations with a simple probabilistic model, leading to scalings over the form $d=O(\\sqrt{n})$ for the affine invariant case and $d=O(n)$ for the sparse case, where $n$ is the number of examples and $d$ the ambient dimension; and finally, (e) we propose an efficient iterative algorithm with running-time complexity proportional to $O(nd^2)$, improving on earlier algorithms for discriminative clustering with the square loss, which had quadratic complexity in the number of examples",

    "title": "Making Decision Trees Feasible in Ultrahigh Feature and Label Dimensions",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Due to the non-linear but highly interpretable representations, decision tree (DT) models have significantly attracted a lot of attention of researchers. However, it is difficult to understand and interpret DT models in ultrahigh dimensions and DT models usually suffer from the curse of dimensionality and achieve degenerated performance when there are many noisy features. To address these issues, this paper first presents a novel data- dependent generalization error bound for the perceptron decision tree (PDT), which provides the theoretical justification to learn a sparse linear hyperplane in each decision node and to prune the tree. Following our analysis, we introduce the notion of budget-aware classifier (BAC) with a budget constraint on the weight coefficients, and propose a supervised budgeted tree (SBT) algorithm to achieve non-linear prediction performance. To avoid generating an unstable and complicated decision tree and improve the generalization of the SBT, we present a pruning strategy by learning classifiers to minimize cross-validation errors on each BAC. To deal with ultrahigh label dimensions, based on three important phenomena of real-world data sets from a variety of application domains, we develop a sparse coding tree framework for multi-label annotation problems and provide the theoretical analysis. Extensive empirical studies verify that 1) SBT is easy to understand and interpret in ultrahigh dimensions and is more resilient to noisy features. 2) Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our proposed sparse coding tree framework is more efficient, yet accurate in ultrahigh label and feature dimensions",

The resulting model, GP-LSTM, fully encapsulates the inductive biases of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent networks, while retaining the non-parametric probabilistic advantages of Gaussian processes. We learn the properties of the proposed kernels by optimizing the Gaussian process marginal likelihood using a new provably convergent semi-stochastic gradient procedure, and exploit the structure of these kernels for scalable training and prediction. This approach provides a practical representation for Bayesian LSTMs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, and thoroughly investigate a consequential autonomous driving application, where the predictive uncertainties provided by GP- LSTM are uniquely valuable",

However, a clear and profound theoretical understanding of the forward pass, the core algorithm of CNN, is still lacking. In parallel, within the wide field of sparse approximation, Convolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) has gained increasing attention in recent years. A theoretical study of this model was recently conducted, establishing it as a reliable and stable alternative to the commonly practiced patch-based processing. Herein, we propose a novel multi-layer model, ML-CSC, in which signals are assumed to emerge from a cascade of CSC layers. This is shown to be tightly connected to CNN, so much so that the forward pass of the CNN is in fact the thresholding pursuit serving the ML-CSC model. This connection brings a fresh view to CNN, as we are able to attribute to this architecture theoretical claims such as uniqueness of the representations throughout the network, and their stable estimation, all guaranteed under simple local sparsity conditions. Lastly, identifying the weaknesses in the above pursuit scheme, we propose an alternative to the forward pass, which is connected to deconvolutional and recurrent networks, and also has better theoretical guarantees",

    "title": "The Impact of Random Models on Clustering Similarity",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Clustering is a central approach for unsupervised learning. After clustering is applied, the most fundamental analysis is to quantitatively compare clusterings. Such comparisons are crucial for the evaluation of clustering methods as well as other tasks such as consensus clustering. It is often argued that, in order to establish a baseline, clustering similarity should be assessed in the context of a random ensemble of clusterings. The prevailing assumption for the random clustering ensemble is the permutation model in which the number and sizes of clusters are fixed. However, this assumption does not necessarily hold in practice; for example, multiple runs of K-means clustering reurns clusterings with a fixed number of clusters, while the cluster size distribution varies greatly. Here, we derive corrected variants of two clustering similarity measures (the Rand index and Mutual Information) in the context of two random clustering ensembles in which the number and sizes of clusters vary. In addition, we study the impact of one-sided comparisons in the scenario with a reference clustering. The consequences of different random models are illustrated using synthetic examples, handwriting recognition, and gene expression data. We demonstrate that the choice of random model can have a drastic impact on the ranking of similar clustering pairs, and the evaluation of a clustering method with respect to a random baseline; thus, the choice of random clustering model should be carefully justified",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We study the cost function for hierarchical clusterings introduced by (Dasgupta, 2016) where hierarchies are treated as first-class objects rather than deriving their cost from projections into flat clusters. It was also shown in (Dasgupta, 2016) that a top-down algorithm based on the uniform Sparsest Cut problem returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most $O\\left(\\alpha_n \\log n\\right)$ times the cost of the optimal hierarchical clustering, where $\\alpha_n$ is the approximation ratio of the Sparsest Cut subroutine used. Thus using the best known approximation algorithm for Sparsest Cut due to Arora-Rao- Vazirani, the top-down algorithm returns a hierarchical clustering of cost at most $O\\left(\\log^{3/2} n\\right)$ times the cost of the optimal solution. We improve this by giving an $O(\\log{n})$-approximation algorithm for this problem. Our main technical ingredients are a combinatorial characterization of ultrametrics induced by this cost function, deriving an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for this family of ultrametrics, and showing how to iteratively round an LP relaxation of this formulation by using the idea of sphere growing which has been extensively used in the context of graph partitioning. We also prove that our algorithm returns an $O(\\log{n})$- approximate hierarchical clustering for a generalization of this cost function also studied in (Dasgupta, 2016). Experiments show that the hierarchies found by using the ILP formulation as well as our rounding algorithm often have better projections into flat clusters than the standard linkage based algorithms. We conclude with constant factor inapproximability results for this problem: 1) no polynomial size LP or SDP can achieve a constant factor approximation for this problem and 2) no polynomial time algorithm can achieve a constant factor approximation under the Small Set Expansion hypothesis",

We present results from a large number of prior works in a unified manner, using a modular and tight analysis that isolates the key arguments in easily re-usable lemmas. This approach strengthens previously known FTRL analysis techniques to produce bounds as tight as those achieved by potential functions or primal-dual analysis. Further, we prove a general and exact equivalence between adaptive Mirror Descent algorithms and a corresponding FTRL update, which allows us to analyze Mirror Descent algorithms in the same framework. The key to bridging the gap between Dural Averaging and Mirror Descent algorithms lies in an analysis of the FTRL-Proximal algorithm family.

    "abstract": "Distributed training of $l_1$ regularized classifiers has received great attention recently. Most existing methods approach this problem by taking steps obtained from approximating the objective by a quadratic approximation that is decoupled at the individual variable level. These methods are designed for multicore systems where communication costs are low. They are inefficient on systems such as Hadoop running on a cluster of commodity machines where communication costs are substantial. In this paper we design a distributed algorithm for $l_1$ regularization that is much better suited for such systems than existing algorithms. A careful cost analysis is used to support these points and motivate our method. The main idea of our algorithm is to do block optimization of many variables on the actual objective function within each computing node; this increases the computational cost per step that is matched with the communication cost, and decreases the number of outer iterations, thus yielding a faster overall method. Distributed Gauss-Seidel and Gauss-Southwell greedy schemes are used for choosing variables to update in each step. We establish global convergence theory for our algorithm, including Q-linear rate of convergence. Experiments on two benchmark problems show our method to be much faster than existing methods",

Most existing studies assume that worker responses follow specific probabilistic models; however, recent evidence shows the presence of workers adopting non-random or even malicious strategies. To account for such workers, we suppose that workers comprise a mixture of honest and adversarial workers. Honest workers may be reliable or unreliable, and they provide labels according to an unknown but explicit probabilistic model. Adversaries adopt labeling strategies different from those of honest workers, whether probabilistic or not. We propose two reputation algorithms to identify unreliable honest workers and adversarial workers from only their responses. Our algorithms assume that honest workers are in the majority, and they classify workers with outlier label patterns as adversaries. Theoretically, we show that our algorithms successfully identify unreliable honest workers, workers adopting deterministic strategies, and worst- case sophisticated adversaries who can adopt arbitrary labeling strategies to degrade the accuracy of the inferred task labels. Empirically, we show that filtering out outliers using our algorithms can significantly improve the accuracy of several state-of-the-art label aggregation algorithms in real-world crowdsourcing datasets",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Many applications, such as human action recognition and object detection, can be formulated as a multiclass classification problem. One-vs-rest (OVR) is one of the most widely used approaches for multiclass classification due to its simplicity and excellent performance. However, many confusing classes in such applications will degrade its results. For example, hand clap and boxing are two confusing actions. Hand clap is easily misclassified as boxing, and vice versa. Therefore, precisely classifying confusing classes remains a challenging task. To obtain better performance for multiclass classifications that have confusing classes, we first develop a classifier chain model for multiclass classification (CCMC) to transfer class information between classifiers. Then, based on an analysis of our proposed model, we propose an easy- to-hard learning paradigm for multiclass classification to automatically identify easy and hard classes and then use the predictions from simpler classes to help solve harder classes. Similar to CCMC, the classifier chain (CC) model is also proposed by Read et al. (2009) to capture the label dependency for multi-label classification. However, CC does not consider the order of difficulty of the labels and achieves degenerated performance when there are many confusing labels. Therefore, it is non- trivial to learn the appropriate label order for CC. Motivated by our analysis for CCMC, we also propose the easy-to-hard learning paradigm for multi-label classification to automatically identify easy and hard labels, and then use the predictions from simpler labels to help solve harder labels. We also demonstrate that our proposed strategy can be successfully applied to a wide range of applications, such as ordinal classification and relationship prediction.

    "abstract": "We introduce openXBOW, an open-source toolkit for the generation of bag-of-words (BoW) representations from multimodal input. In the BoW principle, word histograms were first used as features in document classification, but the idea was and can easily be adapted to, e.g., acoustic or visual descriptors, introducing a prior step of vector quantisation. The openXBOW toolkit supports arbitrary numeric input features and text input and concatenates computed sub-bags to a final bag. It provides a variety of extensions and options. To our knowledge, openXBOW is the first publicly available toolkit for the generation of crossmodal bags-of-words. The capabilities of the tool have been exemplified in different scenarios: sentiment analysis in tweets, classification of snore sounds, and time-dependent emotion recognition based on acoustic, linguistic, and visual information, where improved results over other feature representations were observed",

Moreover, we show that larger step-sizes are allowed when considering mini-batches.

    "abstract": "Recently, fundamental conditions on the sampling patterns have been obtained for finite completability of low-rank matrices or tensors given the corresponding ranks. In this paper, we consider the scenario where the rank is not given and we aim to approximate the unknown rank based on the location of sampled entries and some given completion. We consider a number of data models, including single-view matrix, multi-view matrix, CP tensor, tensor-train tensor and Tucker tensor. For each of these data models, we provide an upper bound on the rank when an arbitrary low-rank completion is given. We characterize these bounds both deterministically, i.e., with probability one given that the sampling pattern satisfies certain combinatorial properties, and probabilistically, i.e., with high probability given that the sampling probability is above some threshold. Moreover, for both single-view matrix and CP tensor, we are able to show that the obtained upper bound is exactly equal to the unknown rank if the lowest-rank completion is given. Furthermore, we provide numerical experiments for the case of single-view matrix, where we use nuclear norm minimization to find a low-rank completion of the sampled data and we observe that in most of the cases the proposed upper bound on the rank is equal to the true rank",

    "abstract": "Multiclass classification problems such as image annotation can involve a large number of classes. In this context, confusion between classes can occur, and single label classification may be misleading. We provide in the present paper a general device that, given an unlabeled dataset and a score function defined as the minimizer of some empirical and convex risk, outputs a set of class labels, instead of a single one. Interestingly, this procedure does not require that the unlabeled dataset explores the whole classes. Even more, the method is calibrated to control the expected size of the output set while minimizing the classification risk. We show the statistical optimality of the procedure and establish rates of convergence under the Tsybakov margin condition. It turns out that these rates are linear on the number of labels. We apply our methodology to convex aggregation of confidence sets based on the $V$-fold cross validation principle also known as the superlearning principle (van der Laan et al., 2007). We illustrate the numerical performance of the procedure on real data and demonstrate in particular that with moderate expected size, w.r.t. the number of labels, the procedure provides significant improvement of the classification risk",

The problem is cast as an online game between a learner and sequence of users, over $T$ rounds. In both settings, the learners objective is to present ranked list of items to the users. The learner's performance is judged on the entire ranked list and true relevances of the items. However, the learner receives highly restricted feedback at end of each round, in form of relevances of only the top $k$ ranked items, where $k \\ll m$. The first setting is non-contextual, where the list of items to be ranked is fixed. The second setting is contextual, where lists of items vary, in form of traditional query-document lists. No stochastic assumption is made on the generation process of relevances of items and contexts. We provide efficient ranking strategies for both the settings. The strategies achieve $O(T^{2/3})$ regret, where regret is based on popular ranking measures in first setting and ranking surrogates in second setting. We also provide impossibility results for certain ranking measures and a certain class of surrogates, when feedback is restricted to the top ranked item, i.e. $k=1$.

    "title": "A Unifying Framework for Gaussian Process Pseudo-Point Approximations using Power Expectation Propagation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions over functions that enable high-level assumptions about unknown functions to be encoded in a parsimonious, flexible and general way. Although elegant, the application of GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models. Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper we develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point approximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference (variational free- energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way all of the approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling time', resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on regression and classification tasks",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper makes two contributions to Bayesian machine learning algorithms. Firstly, we propose stochastic natural gradient expectation propagation (SNEP), a novel alternative to expectation propagation (EP), a popular variational inference algorithm. SNEP is a black box variational algorithm, in that it does not require any simplifying assumptions on the distribution of interest, beyond the existence of some Monte Carlo sampler for estimating the moments of the EP tilted distributions. Further, as opposed to EP which has no guarantee of convergence, SNEP can be shown to be convergent, even when using Monte Carlo moment estimates. Secondly, we propose a novel architecture for distributed Bayesian learning which we call the posterior server. The posterior server allows scalable and robust Bayesian learning in cases where a data set is stored in a distributed manner across a cluster, with each compute node containing a disjoint subset of data. An independent Monte Carlo sampler is run on each compute node, with direct access only to the local data subset, but which targets an approximation to the global posterior distribution given all data across the whole cluster. This is achieved by using a distributed asynchronous implementation of SNEP to pass messages across the cluster. We demonstrate SNEP and the posterior server on distributed Bayesian learning of logistic regression and neural networks",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore statistical versus computational trade-off to address a basic question in the application of a distributed algorithm: what is the minimal computational cost in obtaining statistical optimality? In smoothing spline setup, we observe a phase transition phenomenon for the number of deployed machines that ends up being a simple proxy for computing cost. Specifically, a sharp upper bound for the number of machines is established: when the number is below this bound, statistical optimality (in terms of nonparametric estimation or testing) is achievable; otherwise, statistical optimality becomes impossible. These sharp bounds partly capture intrinsic computational limits of the distributed algorithm considered in this paper, and turn out to be fully determined by the smoothness of the regression function. We name the asymptotic analysis on such split-and-aggregation estimation/inference as splitotic theory. As a side remark, we argue that sample splitting may be viewed as an alternative form of regularization, playing a similar role as smoothing parameter",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in developing high-impact machine learning technologies is balancing the need to model rich, structured domains with the ability to scale to big data. Many important problem areas are both richly structured and large scale, from social and biological networks, to knowledge graphs and the Web, to images, video, and natural language. In this paper, we introduce two new formalisms for modeling structured data, and show that they can both capture rich structure and scale to big data. The first, hinge-loss Markov random fields (HL-MRFs), is a new kind of probabilistic graphical model that generalizes different approaches to convex inference. We unite three approaches from the randomized algorithms, probabilistic graphical models, and fuzzy logic communities, showing that all three lead to the same inference objective. We then define HL- MRFs by generalizing this unified objective. The second new formalism, probabilistic soft logic (PSL), is a probabilistic programming language that makes HL-MRFs easy to define using a syntax based on first-order logic. We introduce an algorithm for inferring most-probable variable assignments (MAP inference) that is much more scalable than general-purpose convex optimization methods, because it uses message passing to take advantage of sparse dependency structures. We then show how to learn the parameters of HL-MRFs. The learned HL-MRFs are as accurate as analogous discrete models, but much more scalable. Together, these algorithms enable HL-MRFs and PSL to model rich, structured data at scales not previously possible",

HMM-VB leverages prior information about chain-like dependence among groups of variables to achieve the effect of dimension reduction. In case such a dependence structure is unknown or assumed merely for the sake of parsimonious modeling, we develop a recursive search algorithm based on BIC to optimize the formation of ordered variable blocks. The MBW algorithm ensures the feasibility of clustering via mode association, achieving linear complexity in terms of the number of variable blocks despite the exponentially growing number of possible state sequences in HMM-VB. In addition, we provide theoretical investigations about the identifiability of HMM-VB as well as the consistency of our approach to search for the block partition of variables in a special case.

    "title": "Approximation Vector Machines for Large-scale Online Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "One of the most challenging problems in kernel online learning is to bound the model size and to promote model sparsity. Sparse models not only improve computation and memory usage, but also enhance the generalization capacity -- a principle that concurs with the law of parsimony. However, inappropriate sparsity modeling may also significantly degrade the performance. In this paper, we propose Approximation Vector Machine (AVM), a model that can simultaneously encourage sparsity and safeguard its risk in compromising the performance. In an online setting context, when an incoming instance arrives, we approximate this instance by one of its neighbors whose distance to it is less than a predefined threshold. Our key intuition is that since the newly seen instance is expressed by its nearby neighbor the optimal performance can be analytically formulated and maintained. We develop theoretical foundations to support this intuition and further establish an analysis for the common loss functions including Hinge, smooth Hinge, and Logistic (i.e., for the classification task) and $\\ell_{1}$, $\\ell_{2}$, and $\\varepsilon$-insensitive (i.e., for the regression task) to characterize the gap between the approximation and optimal solutions. This gap crucially depends on two key factors including the frequency of approximation (i.e., how frequent the approximation operation takes place) and the predefined threshold. We conducted extensive experiments for classification and regression tasks in batch and online modes using several benchmark datasets. The quantitative results show that our proposed AVM obtained comparable predictive performances with current state-of-the-art methods while simultaneously achieving significant computational speed-up due to the ability of the proposed AVM in maintaining the model size",

We then illustrate the technique on several examples. Within the context of exponential families, the proposed method produces samples from a posterior distribution which is updated as data arrive in a streaming fashion. The sampling technique can be used to track time-varying truncated distributions, as well as to obtain samples from a changing mixture model, fitted in a streaming fashion to data. In the setting of linear optimization, the proposed method has oracle complexity with best known dependence on the dimension for certain geometries. In the context of online learning and repeated games, the algorithm is an efficient method for implementing no-regret mixture forecasting strategies.

    "abstract": "In modern large-scale machine learning applications, the training data are often partitioned and stored on multiple machines. It is customary to employ the data parallelism approach, where the aggregated training loss is minimized without moving data across machines. In this paper, we introduce a novel distributed dual formulation for regularized loss minimization problems that can directly handle data parallelism in the distributed setting. This formulation allows us to systematically derive dual coordinate optimization procedures, which we refer to as Distributed Alternating Dual Maximization (DADM). The framework extends earlier studies described in (Boyd et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2017; Jaggi et al., 2014; Yang, 2013) and has rigorous theoretical analyses. Moreover, with the help of the new formulation, we develop the accelerated version of DADM (Acc-DADM) by generalizing the acceleration technique from (Shalev-Shwartz and Zhang, 2014) to the distributed setting. We also provide theoretical results for the proposed accelerated version, and the new result improves previous ones (Yang, 2013; Ma et al., 2017) whose iteration complexities grow linearly on the condition number. Our empirical studies validate our theory and show that our accelerated approach significantly improves the previous state- of-the-art distributed dual coordinate optimization algorithms",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dynamical systems comprising of multiple components that can be partitioned into distinct blocks originate in many scientific areas. A pertinent example is the interactions between financial assets and selected macroeconomic indicators, which has been studied at aggregate level---e.g. a stock index and an employment index---extensively in the macroeconomics literature. A key shortcoming of this approach is that it ignores potential influences from other related components (e.g. Gross Domestic Product) that may impact the system's dynamics and structure and thus produces incorrect results. To mitigate this issue, we consider a multi-block linear dynamical system with Granger-causal ordering between blocks, wherein the blocks' temporal dynamics are described by vector autoregressive processes and are influenced by blocks higher in the system hierarchy. We derive the maximum likelihood estimator for the posited model for Gaussian data in the high- dimensional setting based on appropriate regularization schemes for the parameters of the block components. To optimize the underlying non-convex likelihood function, we develop an iterative algorithm with convergence guarantees. We establish theoretical properties of the maximum likelihood estimates, leveraging the decomposability of the regularizers and a careful analysis of the iterates. Finally, we develop testing procedures for the null hypothesis of whether a block Granger-causes another block of variables. The performance of the model and the testing procedures are evaluated on synthetic data, and illustrated on a data set involving log-returns of the US S&P100 component stocks and key macroeconomic variables for the 2001--16 period",

    "abstract": "Distributed learning is an effective way to analyze big data. In distributed regression, a typical approach is to divide the big data into multiple blocks, apply a base regression algorithm on each of them, and then simply average the output functions learnt from these blocks. Since the average process will decrease the variance, not the bias, bias correction is expected to improve the learning performance if the base regression algorithm is a biased one. Regularization kernel network is an effective and widely used method for nonlinear regression analysis. In this paper we will investigate a bias corrected version of regularization kernel network. We derive the error bounds when it is applied to a single data set and when it is applied as a base algorithm in distributed regression.

One possible method is to use instrumental variables, which are typically justified by background knowledge.

We present instrumental variable discovery methods that systematically characterize which set of causal effects can and cannot be discovered under local graphical criteria that define instrumental variables, without reconstructing full causal graphs.

    "title": "Classification of Time Sequences using Graphs of Temporal Constraints",

    "abstract": "We introduce two algorithms that learn to classify Symbolic and Scalar Time Sequences (SSTS); an extension of multivariate time series. An SSTS is a set of \\emph{events} and a set of scalars. An event is defined by a symbol and a time-stamp. A scalar is defined by a symbol and a function mapping a number for each possible time stamp of the data. The proposed algorithms rely on temporal patterns called Graph of Temporal Constraints (GTC). A GTC is a directed graph in which vertices express occurrences of specific events, and edges express temporal constraints between occurrences of pairs of events. Additionally, each vertex of a GTC can be augmented with numeric constraints on scalar values. We allow GTCs to be cyclic and/or disconnected. The first of the introduced algorithms extracts sets of co-dependent GTCs to be used in a voting mechanism. The second algorithm builds decision forest like representations where each node is a GTC. In both algorithms, extraction of GTCs and model building are interleaved. Both algorithms are closely related to each other and they exhibit complementary properties including complexity, performance, and interpretability. The main novelties of this work reside in direct building of the model and efficient learning of GTC structures. We explain the proposed algorithms and evaluate their performance against a diverse collection of 59 benchmark data sets. In these experiments, our algorithms come across as highly competitive and in most cases closely match or outperform state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of the computational speed while dominating in terms of the accuracy of classification of time sequences",

Estimating an HMM from its observation process is often addressed via the Baum-Welch algorithm, which is known to be susceptible to local optima. In this paper, we first give a general characterization of the basin of attraction associated with any global optimum of the population likelihood. By exploiting this characterization, we provide non-asymptotic finite sample guarantees on the Baum-Welch updates and show geometric convergence to a small ball of radius on the order of the minimax rate around a global optimum. As a concrete example, we prove a linear rate of convergence for a hidden Markov mixture of two isotropic Gaussians given a suitable mean separation and an initialization within a ball of large radius around (one of) the true parameters. To our knowledge, these are the first rigorous local convergence guarantees to global optima for the Baum-Welch algorithm in a setting where the likelihood function is nonconvex.

A recently introduced technique called screening rules propose to ignore some variables in the optimization leveraging the expected sparsity of the solutions and consequently leading to faster solvers. When the procedure is guaranteed not to discard variables wrongly the rules are said to be safe. In this work, we propose a unifying framework for generalized linear models regularized with standard sparsity enforcing penalties such as $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norms. Our technique allows to discard safely more variables than previously considered safe rules, particularly for low regularization parameters. Our proposed Gap Safe rules (so called because they rely on duality gap computation) can cope with any iterative solver but are particularly well suited to (block) coordinate descent methods. Applied to many standard learning tasks, Lasso, Sparse Group Lasso, multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, etc., we report significant speed-ups compared to previously proposed safe rules on all tested data sets",

    "abstract": "Preserving privacy of continuous and/or high-dimensional data such as images, videos and audios, can be challenging with syntactic anonymization methods which are designed for discrete attributes. Differentially privacy, which uses a more rigorous definition of privacy loss, has shown more success in sanitizing continuous data. However, both syntactic and differential privacy are susceptible to inference attacks, i.e., an adversary can accurately infer sensitive attributes from sanitized data. The paper proposes a novel filter-based mechanism which preserves privacy of continuous and high-dimensional attributes against inference attacks. Finding the optimal utility-privacy tradeoff is formulated as a min-diff-max optimization problem. The paper provides an ERM-like analysis of the generalization error and also a practical algorithm to perform minimax optimization. In addition, the paper proposes a noisy minimax filter which combines minimax filter and differentially-private mechanism. Advantages of the method over purely noisy mechanisms is explained and demonstrated with examples. Experiments with several real-world tasks including facial expression classification, speech emotion classification, and activity classification from motion, show that the minimax filter can simultaneously achieve similar or higher target task accuracy and lower inference accuracy, often significantly lower than previous methods",

This results opens the door to a lot of other applications of square matrices factorization. Our approach based on complex embeddings is arguably simple, as it only involves a Hermitian dot product, the complex counterpart of the standard dot product between real vectors, whereas other methods resort to more and more complicated composition functions to increase their expressiveness.

To mitigate this issue, we introduce a stabilized truncated stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We employ a soft- thresholding scheme on the weight vector where the imposed shrinkage is adaptive to the amount of information available in each feature. The variability in the resulted sparse weight vector is further controlled by stability selection integrated with the informative truncation. To facilitate better convergence, we adopt an annealing strategy on the truncation rate, which leads to a balanced trade-off between exploration and exploitation in learning a sparse weight vector. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm compares favorably with the original truncated gradient SGD in terms of prediction accuracy, achieving both better sparsity and stability",

These optimization problems are intimately related; for example, min-cut problems and total variation denoising problems, where the cut function is submodular and its Lovasz extension is given by the associated total variation. When a quadratic loss is regularized by the total variation of a cut function, it thus becomes a total variation denoising problem and we use the same terminology in this paper for general submodular functions. We propose a new active-set algorithm for total variation denoising with the assumption of an oracle that solves the corresponding SFM problem. This can be seen as local descent algorithm over ordered partitions with explicit convergence guarantees. It is more flexible than the existing algorithms with the ability for warm-restarts using the solution of a closely related problem. Further, we also consider the case when a submodular function can be decomposed into the sum of two submodular functions $F_1$ and $F_2$ and assume SFM oracles for these two functions. We propose a new active-set algorithm for total variation denoising (and hence SFM by thresholding the solution at zero). This algorithm also performs local descent over ordered partitions and its ability to warm start considerably improves the performance of the algorithm. In the experiments, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithms with state-of-the-art algorithms, showing that it reduces the calls to SFM oracles",

    "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent with a constant learning rate (constant SGD) simulates a Markov chain with a stationary distribution. With this perspective, we derive several new results. (1) We show that constant SGD can be used as an approximate Bayesian posterior inference algorithm. Specifically, we show how to adjust the tuning parameters of constant SGD to best match the stationary distribution to a posterior, minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between these two distributions. (2) We demonstrate that constant SGD gives rise to a new variational EM algorithm that optimizes hyperparameters in complex probabilistic models. (3) We also show how to tune SGD with momentum for approximate sampling. (4) We analyze stochastic-gradient MCMC algorithms. For Stochastic- Gradient Langevin Dynamics and Stochastic-Gradient Fisher Scoring, we quantify the approximation errors due to finite learning rates. Finally (5), we use the stochastic process perspective to give a short proof of why Polyak averaging is optimal. Based on this idea, we propose a scalable approximate MCMC algorithm, the Averaged Stochastic Gradient Sampler",

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in neuroimaging analysis, we propose a new regression model, Sparse TensOr REsponse regression (STORE), with a tensor response and a vector predictor. STORE embeds two key sparse structures: element-wise sparsity and low-rankness. It can handle both a non-symmetric and a symmetric tensor response, and thus is applicable to both structural and functional neuroimaging data. We formulate the parameter estimation as a non-convex optimization problem, and develop an efficient alternating updating algorithm. We establish a non- asymptotic estimation error bound for the actual estimator obtained from the proposed algorithm. This error bound reveals an interesting interaction between the computational efficiency and the statistical rate of convergence. When the distribution of the error tensor is Gaussian, we further obtain a fast estimation error rate which allows the tensor dimension to grow exponentially with the sample size. We illustrate the efficacy of our model through intensive simulations and an analysis of the Autism spectrum disorder neuroimaging data",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques optimize the accumulated long-term reward of a suitably chosen reward function. However, designing such a reward function often requires a lot of task- specific prior knowledge. The designer needs to consider different objectives that do not only influence the learned behavior but also the learning progress. To alleviate these issues, preference-based reinforcement learning algorithms (PbRL) have been proposed that can directly learn from an expert's preferences instead of a hand-designed numeric reward. PbRL has gained traction in recent years due to its ability to resolve the reward shaping problem, its ability to learn from non numeric rewards and the possibility to reduce the dependence on expert knowledge. We provide a unified framework for PbRL that describes the task formally and points out the different design principles that affect the evaluation task for the human as well as the computational complexity. The design principles include the type of feedback that is assumed, the representation that is learned to capture the preferences, the optimization problem that has to be solved as well as how the exploration/exploitation problem is tackled. Furthermore, we point out shortcomings of current algorithms, propose open research questions and briefly survey practical tasks that have been solved using PbRL",

This leads to new data-driven spectral estimators, whose optimality is discussed using tools from random matrix theory and through numerical experiments. Under the spiked population model and in the asymptotic setting where the dimensions of the data matrix are let going to infinity, some theoretical properties of our approach are compared to recent results on asymptotically optimal shrinking rules for Gaussian noise.

An expectation propagation (EP) algorithm for posterior inference under the proposed model is derived. For large scale problems, the standard EP algorithm can be prohibitively slow.

We adapt recent randomized low-rank approximation algorithms to provide an efficient solution to principal component analysis (PCA), and we use this efficient solver to improve estimation in large- scale linear mixed models (LMM) for association mapping in statistical genomics. A key observation in this paper is that randomization serves a dual role, improving both computational and statistical performance by implicitly regularizing the covariance matrix estimate of the random effect in an LMM.

We develop a gradient descent algorithm (referred to as RWF for reshaped Wirtinger flow) by minimizing the quadratic loss of the magnitude measurements. Comparing with Wirtinger flow (WF) (Candes et al., 2015), the loss function of RWF is nonconvex and nonsmooth, but better resembles the least-squares loss when the phase information is also available. We show that for random Gaussian measurements, RWF enjoys linear convergence to the true signal as long as the number of measurements is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. This improves the sample complexity of WF ($\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$), and achieves the same sample complexity as truncated Wirtinger flow (TWF) (Chen and Candes, 2015), but without any sophisticated truncation in the gradient loop. Furthermore, RWF costs less computationally than WF, and runs faster numerically than both WF and TWF. We further develop an incremental (stochastic) version of RWF (IRWF) and connect it with the randomized Kaczmarz method for phase retrieval. We demonstrate that IRWF outperforms existing incremental as well as batch algorithms with experiments",

After studying the convergence properties of GCG for general convex composite problems, we develop efficient methods for evaluating polar operators, a subroutine that is required in each GCG iteration. In particular, we show how the polar operator can be efficiently evaluated in learning low-rank matrices, instantiated with detailed examples on matrix completion and dictionary learning. A further improvement is achieved by interleaving GCG with fixed-rank local subspace optimization.

    "abstract": "Follow the leader (FTL) is a simple online learning algorithm that is known to perform well when the loss functions are convex and positively curved. In this paper we ask whether there are other settings when FTL achieves low regret. In particular, we study the fundamental problem of linear prediction over a convex, compact domain with non-empty interior. Amongst other results, we prove that the curvature of the boundary of the domain can act as if the losses were curved: In this case, we prove that as long as the mean of the loss vectors have positive lengths bounded away from zero, FTL enjoys logarithmic regret, while for polytope domains and stochastic data it enjoys finite expected regret. The former result is also extended to strongly convex domains by establishing an equivalence between the strong convexity of sets and the minimum curvature of their boundary, which may be of independent interest. Building on a previously known meta-algorithm, we also get an algorithm that simultaneously enjoys the worst-case guarantees and the smaller regret of FTL when the data is `easy'. Finally, we show that such guarantees are achievable directly (e.g., by the follow the regularized leader algorithm or by a shrinkage-based variant of FTL) when the constraint set is an ellipsoid",

While community detection has proven to be a useful exploratory technique for the analysis of single-layer networks, the development of community detection methods for multilayer networks is still in its infancy. We propose and investigate a procedure, called Multilayer Extraction, that identifies densely connected vertex-layer sets in multilayer networks. Multilayer Extraction makes use of a significance based score that quantifies the connectivity of an observed vertex-layer set through comparison with a fixed degree random graph model. Multilayer Extraction directly handles networks with heterogeneous layers where community structure may be different from layer to layer. The procedure can capture overlapping communities, as well as background vertex-layer pairs that do not belong to any community. We establish consistency of the vertex-layer set optimizer of our proposed multilayer score under the multilayer stochastic block model. We investigate the performance of Multilayer Extraction on three applications and a test bed of simulations.
