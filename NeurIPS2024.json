    "title": "MicroAdam: Accurate Adaptive Optimization with Low Space Overhead and Provable Convergence",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a new variant of the Adam optimizer called MicroAdam that specifically minimizes memory overheads, while maintaining theoretical convergence guarantees. We achieve this by compressing the gradient information before it is fed into the optimizer state, thereby reducing its memory footprint significantly. We control the resulting compression error via a novel instance of the classical error feedback mechanism from distributed optimization in which the error correction information is itself compressed to allow for practical memory gains. We prove that the resulting approach maintains theoretical convergence guarantees competitive to those of AMSGrad, while providing good practical performance. Specifically, we show that MicroAdam can be implemented efficiently on GPUs: on both million-scale (BERT) and billion-scale (LLaMA) models, MicroAdam provides practical convergence competitive to that of the uncompressed Adam baseline, with lower memory usage and similar running time.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for various tasks with graph structures. Though LLMs can process graph information in a textual format, they overlook the rich vision modality, which is an intuitive way for humans to comprehend structural information and conduct general graph reasoning. The potential benefits and capabilities of representing graph structures as visual images (i.e., $\\textit{visual graph}$) are still unexplored. To fill the gap, we innovatively propose an end-to-end framework, called $\\textbf{G}$raph to v$\\textbf{I}$sual and $\\textbf{T}$extual Integr$\\textbf{A}$tion (GITA), which firstly incorporates visual graphs into general graph reasoning.

    "title": "How does PDE order affect the convergence of PINNs?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper analyzes the inverse relationship between the order of partial differential equations (PDEs) and the convergence of gradient descent in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with the power of ReLU activation. The integration of the PDE into a loss function endows PINNs with a distinctive feature to require computing derivatives of model up to the PDE order. Although it has been empirically observed that PINNs encounter difficulties in convergence when dealing with high-order or high-dimensional PDEs, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of this issue remains elusive. This paper offers theoretical support for this pathological behavior by demonstrating that the gradient flow converges in a lower probability when the PDE order is higher. In addition, we show that PINNs struggle to address high-dimensional problems because the influence of dimensionality on convergence is exacerbated with increasing PDE order. To address the pathology, we use the insights garnered to consider variable splitting that decomposes the high-order PDE into a system of lower-order PDEs. We prove that by reducing the differential order, the gradient flow of variable splitting is more likely to converge to the global optimum. Furthermore, we present numerical experiments in support of our theoretical claims",

    "title": "Fair Wasserstein Coresets",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Data distillation and coresets have emerged as popular approaches to generate a smaller representative set of samples for downstream learning tasks to handle large-scale datasets. At the same time, machine learning is being increasingly applied to decision-making processes at a societal level, making it imperative for modelers to address inherent biases towards subgroups present in the data. While current approaches focus on creating fair synthetic representative samples by optimizing local properties relative to the original samples, their impact on downstream learning processes has yet to be explored. In this work, we present fair Wasserstein coresets ($\\texttt{FWC}$), a novel coreset approach which generates fair synthetic representative samples along with sample-level weights to be used in downstream learning tasks. $\\texttt{FWC}$ uses an efficient majority minimization algorithm to minimize the Wasserstein distance between the original dataset and the weighted synthetic samples while enforcing demographic parity. We show that an unconstrained version of $\\texttt{FWC}$ is equivalent to Lloyd's algorithm for k-medians and k-means clustering. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real datasets show that $\\texttt{FWC}$: (i) achieves a competitive fairness-performance tradeoff in downstream models compared to existing approaches, (ii) improves downstream fairness when added to the existing training data and (iii) can be used to reduce biases in predictions from large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)",

    "title": "Improved Regret for Bandit Convex Optimization with Delayed Feedback",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We investigate bandit convex optimization (BCO) with delayed feedback, where only the loss value of the action is revealed under an arbitrary delay. Let $n,T,\\bar{d}$ denote the dimensionality, time horizon, and average delay, respectively. Previous studies have achieved an $O(\\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+(n\\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret bound for this problem, whose delay-independent part matches the regret of the classical non-delayed bandit gradient descent algorithm. However, there is a large gap between its delay-dependent part, i.e., $O((n\\bar{d})^{1/3}T^{2/3})$, and an existing $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\bar{d}T})$ lower bound. In this paper, we illustrate that this gap can be filled in the worst case, where $\\bar{d}$ is very close to the maximum delay $d$. Specifically, we first develop a novel algorithm, and prove that it enjoys a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{n}T^{3/4}+\\sqrt{dT})$ in general. Compared with the previous result, our regret bound is better for $d=O((n\\bar{d})^{2/3}T^{1/3})$, and the delay-dependent part is tight in the worst case. The primary idea is to decouple the joint effect of the delays and the bandit feedback on the regret by carefully incorporating the delayed bandit feedback with a blocking update mechanism. Furthermore, we show that the proposed algorithm can improve the regret bound to $O((nT)^{2/3}\\log^{1/3}T+d\\log T)$ for strongly convex functions. Finally, if the action sets are unconstrained, we demonstrate that it can be simply extended to achieve an $O(n\\sqrt{T\\log T}+d\\log T)$ regret bound for strongly convex and smooth functions",

    "abstract": "Mastering games is a hard task, as games can be extremely complex, and still fundamentally different in structure from one another. While the AlphaZero algorithm has demonstrated an impressive ability to learn the rules and strategy of a large variety of games, ranging from Go and Chess, to Atari games, its reliance on extensive computational resources and rigid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture limits its adaptability and scalability. A model trained to play on a $19\\times 19$ Go board cannot be used to play on a smaller $13\\times 13$ board, despite the similarity between the two Go variants.In this paper, we focus on Chess, and explore using a more generic Graph-based Representation of a game state, rather than a grid-based one, to introduce a more general architecture based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We also expand the classical Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer to incorporate edge-features, to naturally provide a generic policy output format.Our experiments, performed on smaller networks than the initial AlphaZero paper, show that this new architecture outperforms previous architectures with a similar number of parameters, being able to increase playing strength an order of magnitude faster. We also show that the model, when trained on a smaller $5\\times 5$ variant of chess, is able to be quickly fine-tuned to play on regular $8\\times 8$ chess, suggesting that this approach yields promising generalization abilities.Our code is available at https://github.com/akulen/AlphaGateau",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Hippocampal place cells are known for their spatially selective firing patterns, which has led to the suggestion that they encode an animal's location. However, place cells also respond to contextual cues, such as smell. Furthermore, they have the ability to remap, wherein the firing fields and rates of cells change in response to changes in the environment. How place cell responses emerge, and how these representations remap is not fully understood. In this work, we propose a similarity-based objective function that translates proximity in space, to proximity in representation. We show that a neural network trained to minimize the proposed objective learns place-like representations. We also show that the proposed objective is easily extended to include other sources of information, such as context information, in the same way. When trained to encode multiple contexts, networks learn distinct representations, exhibiting remapping behaviors between contexts. The proposed objective is invariant to orthogonal transformations. Such transformations of the original trained representation (e.g. rotations), therefore yield new representations distinct from the original, without explicit relearning, akin to remapping. Our findings shed new light on the formation and encoding properties of place cells, and also demonstrate an interesting case of representational reuse",

    "title": "Robust Sparse Regression with Non-Isotropic Designs",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We develop a technique to design efficiently computable estimators for sparse linear regression in the simultaneous presence of two adversaries: oblivious and adaptive.Consider the model $y^*=X^*\\beta^*+ \\eta$ where $X^*$ is an $n\\times d$ random design matrix, $\\beta^*\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is a $k$-sparse vector, and the noise $\\eta$ is independent of $X^*$ and chosen by the \\emph{oblivious adversary}. Apart from the independence of $X^*$, we only require a small fraction entries of $\\eta$ to have magnitude at most $1$. The \\emph{adaptive adversary} is allowed to arbitrarily corrupt an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of the samples $(X_1^*, y_1^*),\\ldots, (X_n^*, y_n^*)$.Given the $\\varepsilon$-corrupted samples $(X_1, y_1),\\ldots, (X_n, y_n)$, the goal is to estimate $\\beta^*$. We assume that the rows of $X^*$ are iid samples from some $d$-dimensional distribution $\\mathcal{D}$ with zero mean and (unknown) covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ with bounded condition number.We design several robust algorithms that outperform the state of the art even in the special case of Gaussian noise $\\eta \\sim N(0,1)^n$. In particular, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability recovers $\\beta^*$ up to error $O(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \\ge \\tilde{O}(k^2/\\varepsilon)$, only assuming some bounds on the third and the fourth moments of $\\mathcal{D}$. In addition, prior to this work, even in the special case of Gaussian design $\\mathcal{D} = N(0,\\Sigma)$ and noise $\\eta \\sim N(0,1)$, no polynomial time algorithm was known to achieve error $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ in the sparse setting $n < d^2$. We show that under some assumptions on the fourth and the eighth moments of $\\mathcal{D}$, there is a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves error $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ as long as $n \\ge \\tilde{O}(k^4 / \\varepsilon^3)$. For Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{D} = N(0,\\Sigma)$, this algorithm achieves error $O(\\varepsilon^{3/4})$. Moreover, our algorithm achieves error $o(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ for all log-concave distributions if $\\varepsilon \\le 1/\\text{polylog(d)}$. Our algorithms are based on the filtering of the covariates that uses sum-of-squares relaxations, and weighted Huber loss minimization with $\\ell_1$ regularizer. We provide a novel analysis of weighted penalized Huber loss that is suitable for heavy-tailed designs in the presence of two adversaries. Furthermore, we complement our algorithmic results with Statistical Query lower bounds, providing evidence that our estimators are likely to have nearly optimal sample complexity",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently achieved great success in the synthesis of high-quality images and videos. However, the existing denoising techniques in diffusion models are commonly based on step-by-step noise predictions, which suffers from high computation cost, resulting in a prohibitive latency for interactive applications. In this paper, we propose AdaptiveDiffusion to relieve this bottleneck by adaptively reducing the noise prediction steps during the denoising process. Our method considers the potential of skipping as many noise prediction steps as possible while keeping the final denoised results identical to the original full-step ones. Specifically, the skipping strategy is guided by the third-order latent difference that indicates the stability between timesteps during the denoising process, which benefits the reusing of previous noise prediction results. Extensive experiments on image and video diffusion models demonstrate that our method can significantly speed up the denoising process while generating identical results to the original process, achieving up to an average 2-5x speedup without quality degradation.

    "abstract": "The recent development of chain-of-thought (CoT) decoding has enabled large language models (LLMs) to generate explicit logical reasoning paths for complex problem-solving. However, research indicates that these paths are not always deliberate and optimal. The tree-of-thought (ToT) method employs tree-searching to extensively explore the reasoning space and find better reasoning paths that CoT decoding might overlook. This deliberation, however, comes at the cost of significantly increased inference complexity. In this work, we demonstrate that fine-tuning LLMs leveraging the search tree constructed by ToT allows CoT to achieve similar or better performance, thereby avoiding the substantial inference burden. This is achieved through \\emph{Chain of Preference Optimization} (CPO), where LLMs are fine-tuned to align each step of the CoT reasoning paths with those of ToT using the inherent preference information in the tree-search process. Extensive experimental results show that CPO significantly improves LLM performance in solving a variety of complex problems, including question answering, fact verification, and arithmetic reasoning, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Unlike approaches that extend or search for rationales, DeAR is featured by 1) adopting a tree-based question decomposition manner to plan the organization of rationales, which mimics the logical planning inherentin human cognition; 2) globally updating the rationales at each reasoning step through natural language feedback. Specifically, the Decompose stage decomposes the question into simpler sub-questions, storing them as new nodes; the Analyze stage generates and self-checks rationales for sub-questions at each node evel; and the Rethink stage updates parent-node rationales based on feedback from their child nodes. By generating and updating the reasoning process from a more global perspective, DeAR constructs more adaptive and accurate logical structures for complex problems, facilitating timely error correction compared to rationale-extension and search-based approaches such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) and Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). We conduct extensive experiments on three reasoning benchmarks, including ScienceQA, StrategyQA, and GSM8K, which cover a variety of reasoning tasks, demonstrating that our approach significantly reduces logical errors and enhances performance across various LLMs. Furthermore, we validate that DeAR is an efficient method that achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and reasoning time compared to ToT and GoT",

    "title": "TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability.

Nevertheless, the availability of these models is still limited when we expect to generate images that fall into a specific domain either hard to describe or just unseen to the models. In this work, we propose DomainGallery, a few-shot domain-driven image generation method which aims at finetuning pretrained Stable Diffusion on few-shot target datasets in an attribute-centric manner. Specifically, DomainGallery features prior attribute erasure, attribute disentanglement, regularization and enhancement.

    "title": "Collaborative Cognitive Diagnosis with Disentangled Representation Learning for Learner Modeling",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learners sharing similar implicit cognitive states often display comparable observable problem-solving performances. Leveraging collaborative connections among such similar learners proves valuable in comprehending human learning. Motivated by the success of collaborative modeling in various domains, such as recommender systems, we aim to investigate how collaborative signals among learners contribute to the diagnosis of human cognitive states (i.e., knowledge proficiency) in the context of intelligent education.The primary challenges lie in identifying implicit collaborative connections and disentangling the entangled cognitive factors of learners for improved explainability and controllability in learner Cognitive Diagnosis (CD). However, there has been no work on CD capable of simultaneously modeling collaborative and disentangled cognitive states. To address this gap, we present Coral, a $\\underline{Co}$llabo$\\underline{ra}$tive cognitive diagnosis model with disentang$\\underline{l}$ed representation learning. Specifically, Coral first introduces a disentangled state encoder to achieve the initial disentanglement of learners' states.Subsequently, a meticulously designed collaborative representation learning procedure captures collaborative signals. It dynamically constructs a collaborative graph of learners by iteratively searching for optimal neighbors in a context-aware manner. Using the constructed graph, collaborative information is extracted through node representation learning. Finally, a decoding process aligns the initial cognitive states and collaborative states, achieving co-disentanglement with practice performance reconstructions.Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of Coral, showcasing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several real-world datasets.Our code is available at https://github.com/bigdata-ustc/Coral",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) based agents have shown promise in autonomously completing tasks across various domains, e.g., robotics, games, and web navigation. However, these agents typically require elaborate design and expert prompts to solve tasks in specific domains, which limits their adaptability. We introduce AutoManual, a framework enabling LLM agents to autonomously build their understanding through interaction and adapt to new environments. AutoManual categorizes environmental knowledge into diverse rules and optimizes them in an online fashion by two agents: 1) The Planner codes actionable plans based on current rules for interacting with the environment. 2) The Builder updates the rules through a well-structured rule system that facilitates online rule management and essential detail retention. To mitigate hallucinations in managing rules, we introduce a case-conditioned prompting strategy for the Builder. Finally, the Formulator agent compiles these rules into a comprehensive manual. The self-generated manual can not only improve the adaptability but also guide the planning of smaller LLMs while being human-readable. Given only one simple demonstration, AutoManual significantly improves task success rates, achieving 97.4\\% with GPT-4-turbo and 86.2\\% with GPT-3.5-turbo on ALFWorld benchmark tasks.

    "abstract": "Video-Language Models (VLMs), powered by the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), are charting new frontiers in video understanding. A pivotal challenge is the development of an effective method to encapsulate video content into a set of representative tokens to align with LLMs. In this work, we introduce Slot-VLM, a new framework designed to generate semantically decomposed video tokens, in terms of object-wise and event-wise visual representations, to facilitate LLM inference. Particularly, we design an Object-Event Slots module, i.e., OE-Slots, that adaptively aggregates the dense video tokens from the vision encoder to a set of representative slots. In order to take into account both the spatial object details and the varied temporal dynamics, we build OE-Slots with two branches: the Object-Slots branch and the Event-Slots branch. The Object-Slots branch focuses on extracting object-centric slots from features of high spatial resolution but low frame sample rate, emphasizing detailed object information. The Event-Slots branch is engineered to learn event-centric slots from high temporal sample rate but low spatial resolution features. These complementary slots are combined to form the vision context, serving as the input to the LLM for effective video reasoning. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our Slot-VLM, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on video question-answering",

    "abstract": "Learning complex physical dynamics purely from data is challenging due to the intrinsic properties of systems to be satisfied. Incorporating physics-informed priors, such as in Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs), achieves high-precision modeling for energy-conservative systems. However, real-world systems often deviate from strict energy conservation and follow different physical priors. To address this, we present a framework that achieves high-precision modeling for a wide range of dynamical systems from the numerical aspect, by enforcing Time-Reversal Symmetry (TRS) via a novel regularization term. It helps preserve energies for conservative systems while serving as a strong inductive bias for non-conservative, reversible systems. While TRS is a domain-specific physical prior, we present the first theoretical proof that TRS loss can universally improve modeling accuracy by minimizing higher-order Taylor terms in ODE integration, which is numerically beneficial to various systems regardless of their properties, even for irreversible systems. By integrating the TRS loss within neural ordinary differential equation models, the proposed model TREAT demonstrates superior performance on diverse physical systems. It achieves a significant 11.5% MSE improvement in a challenging chaotic triple-pendulum scenario, underscoring TREAT's broad applicability and effectiveness",

We introduce the Gated Sparse Autoencoder (Gated SAE), which achieves a Pareto improvement over training with prevailing methods. In SAEs, the L1 penalty used to encourage sparsity introduces many undesirable biases, such as shrinkage -- systematic underestimation of feature activations. The key insight of Gated SAEs is to separate the functionality of (a) determining which directions to use and (b) estimating the magnitudes of those directions: this enables us to apply the L1 penalty only to the former, limiting the scope of undesirable side effects. Through training SAEs on LMs of up to 7B parameters we find that, in typical hyper-parameter ranges, Gated SAEs solve shrinkage, are similarly interpretable, and require half as many firing features to achieve comparable reconstruction fidelity",

We propose a novel incremental deep policy gradient method --- Action Value Gradient (AVG) and a set of normalization and scaling techniques to address the challenges of instability in incremental learning. On robotic simulation benchmarks, we show that AVG is the only incremental method that learns effectively, often achieving final performance comparable to batch policy gradient methods.

In this paper, we attempt to explore the ICL process in Transformers through a lens of representation learning. Initially, leveraging kernel methods, we figure out a dual model for one softmax attention layer. The ICL inference process of the attention layer aligns with the training procedure of its dual model, generating token representation predictions that are equivalent to the dual model's test outputs. We delve into the training process of this dual model from a representation learning standpoint and further derive a generalization error bound related to the quantity of demonstration tokens. Subsequently, we extend our theoretical conclusions to more complicated scenarios, including one Transformer layer and multiple attention layers. Furthermore, drawing inspiration from existing representation learning methods especially contrastive learning, we propose potential modifications for the attention layer.

    "abstract": "Generalization remains a central challenge in machine learning. In this work, we propose Learning from Teaching (LoT), a novel regularization technique for deep neural networks to enhance generalization. Inspired by the human ability to capture concise and abstract patterns, we hypothesize that generalizable correlations are expected to be easier to imitate. LoT operationalizes this concept to improve the generalization of the main model with auxiliary student learners. The student learners are trained by the main model and, in turn, provide feedback to help the main model capture more generalizable and imitable correlations. Our experimental results across several domains, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and methodologies like Reinforcement Learning, demonstrate that the introduction of LoT brings significant benefits compared to training models on the original dataset. The results suggest the effectiveness and efficiency of LoT in identifying generalizable information at the right scales while discarding spurious data correlations, thus making LoT a valuable addition to current machine learning.

Instead, we propose a Prospective Representation Learning (PRL) approach to prepare the model for handling conflicts in advance. In the base phase, we squeeze the embedding distribution of the current classes to reserve space for forward compatibility with future classes. In the incremental phase, we make the new class features away from the saved prototypes of old classes in a latent space while aligning the current embedding space with the latent space when updating the model. Thereby, the new class features are clustered in the reserved space to minimize the shock of the new classes on the former classes.

    "abstract": "Visual-Language Alignment (VLA) has gained a lot of attention since CLIP's groundbreaking work. Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent feature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On the other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the similarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural sparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual words.However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no ground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex design to train effectively.In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more interpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for both modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for its local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to leverage its in-context lexical prediction ability.To avoid the false discovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation from falsely frequently activating meaningless words.We demonstrate that these two pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the modest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, including CC-12M).We conduct extensive experiments to analyze LexVLA.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated an excellent understanding of images and 3D data. However, both modalities have shortcomings in holistically capturing the appearance and geometry of objects. Meanwhile, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), which encode information within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), have emerged as an increasingly widespread modality that simultaneously encodes the geometry and photorealistic appearance of objects. This paper investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRF into MLLM. We create LLaNA, the first general-purpose NeRF-languageassistant capable of performing new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q&A. Notably, our method directly processes the weights of the NeRF's MLP to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. Moreover, we build a dataset of NeRFs with text annotations for various NeRF-language tasks with no human intervention.Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that processing NeRF weights performs favourably against extracting 2D or 3D representations from NeRFs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While open Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress, they still fall short of matching the performance of their closed, proprietary counterparts, making the latter attractive even for the use on highly private data. Recently, various new methods have been proposed to adapt closed LLMs to private data without leaking private information to third parties and/or the LLM provider. In this work, we analyze the privacy protection and performance of the four most recent methods for private adaptation of closed LLMs. By examining their threat models and thoroughly comparing their performance under different privacy levels according to differential privacy (DP), various LLM architectures, and multiple datasets for classification and generation tasks, we find that: (1) all the methods leak query data, i.e., the (potentially sensitive) user data that is queried at inference time, to the LLM provider, (2) three out of four methods also leak large fractions of private training data to the LLM provider while the method that protects private data requires a local open LLM, (3) all the methods exhibit lower performance compared to three private gradient-based adaptation methods for local open LLMs, and (4) the private adaptation methods for closed LLMs incur higher monetary training and query costs than running the alternative methods on local open LLMs.This yields the conclusion that, to achieve truly privacy-preserving LLM adaptations that yield high performance and more privacy at lower costs, taking into account current methods and models, one should use open LLMs",

    "abstract": "Within the realm of Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Boundary-Representation (B-Rep) is the standard option for modeling shapes. We present SpelsNet, a neural architecture for the segmentation of 3D point clouds into surface primitive elements under topological supervision of its B-Rep graph structure. We also propose a point-to-BRep adjacency representation that allows for adapting conventional Linear Algebraic Representation of B-Rep graph structure to the point cloud domain. Thanks to this representation, SpelsNet learns from both spatial and topological domains to enable accurate and topologically consistent surface primitive element segmentation. In particular, SpelsNet is composed of two main components; (1) a supervised 3D spatial segmentation head that outputs B-Rep element types and memberships; (2) a graph-based head that leverages the proposed topological supervision. To enable the learning of SpelsNet with the proposed point-to-BRep adjacency supervision, we extend two existing CAD datasets with the required annotations, and conduct a thorough experimental validation on them.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "LLMs are seeing growing use for applications which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in sub-4-bit precision. Our work, KVQuant, facilitates low precision KV cache quantization by incorporating several novel methods: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve < 0.1 perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving LLaMA-7B with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system.

To address these issues, we first establish a large-scale panoramic video-text dataset containing millions of consecutive panoramic keyframes with corresponding panoramic depths, camera poses, and text descriptions. Then, we propose a novel text-driven panoramic generation framework, termed DiffPano, to achieve scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic scene generation. Specifically, benefiting from the powerful generative capabilities of stable diffusion, we fine-tune a single-view text-to-panorama diffusion model with LoRA on the established panoramic video-text dataset. We further design a spherical epipolar-aware multi-view diffusion model to ensure the multi-view consistency of the generated panoramic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffPano can generate scalable, consistent, and diverse panoramic images with given unseen text descriptions and camera poses",

Emphasizing efficiency, we avoid the need for computationally expensive transformers. Leveraging CPC, our method captures long-term dependencies within time-varying confounders. Notably, recent models have disregarded the importance of invertible representation, compromising identification assumptions. To remedy this, we employ the InfoMax principle, maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between sequence data and its representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art counterfactual estimation results using both synthetic and real-world data, marking the pioneering incorporation of Contrastive Predictive Encoding in causal inference",

    "title": "Certified Robustness for Deep Equilibrium Models via Serialized Random Smoothing",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Implicit models such as Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) have emerged as promising alternative approaches for building deep neural networks. Their certified robustness has gained increasing research attention due to security concerns. Existing certified defenses for DEQs employing interval bound propagation and Lipschitz-bounds not only offer conservative certification bounds but also are restricted to specific forms of DEQs. In this paper, we provide the first randomized smoothing certified defense for DEQs to solve these limitations. Our study reveals that simply applying randomized smoothing to certify DEQs provides certified robustness generalized to large-scale datasets but incurs extremely expensive computation costs. To reduce computational redundancy, we propose a novel Serialized Randomized Smoothing (SRS) approach that leverages historical information. Additionally, we derive a new certified radius estimation for SRS to theoretically ensure the correctness of our algorithm. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on image recognition demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly accelerate the certification of DEQs by up to 7x almost without sacrificing the certified accuracy. The implementation will be publicly available upon the acceptance of this work. Our code is available at https://github.com/WeizhiGao/Serialized-Randomized-Smoothing",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can bypass their safety guardrails. In many domains, adversarial training has proven to be one of the most promising methods to reliably improve robustness against such attacks. Yet, in the context of LLMs, current methods for adversarial training are hindered by the high computational costs required to perform discrete adversarial attacks at each training iteration. We address this problem by instead calculating adversarial attacks in the continuous embedding space of the LLM, which is orders of magnitudes more efficient. We propose a fast adversarial training algorithm (C-AdvUL) composed of two losses: the first makes the model robust on continuous embedding attacks computed on an adversarial behaviour dataset; the second ensures the usefulness of the final model by fine-tuning on utility data. Moreover, we introduce C-AdvIPO, an adversarial variant of IPO that does not require utility data for adversarially robust alignment. Our empirical evaluation on five models from different families (Gemma, Phi3, Mistral, Zephyr, Llama2) and at different scales (2B, 3.8B, 7B) shows that both algorithms substantially enhance LLM robustness against discrete attacks (GCG, AutoDAN, PAIR), while maintaining utility. Our results demonstrate that robustness to continuous perturbations can extrapolate to discrete threat models. Thereby, we present a path toward scalable adversarial training algorithms for robustly aligning LLMs",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Vision-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained much attention due to its widespread applications in various 3D perception tasks. Existing sparse-to-dense approaches typically employ shared context-independent queries across various input images, which fails to capture distinctions among them as the focal regions of different inputs vary and may result in undirected feature aggregation of cross-attention. Additionally, the absence of depth information may lead to points projected onto the image plane sharing the same 2D position or similar sampling points in the feature map, resulting in depth ambiguity. In this paper, we present a novel context and geometry aware voxel transformer. It utilizes a context aware query generator to initialize context-dependent queries tailored to individual input images, effectively capturing their unique characteristics and aggregating information within the region of interest. Furthermore, it extend deformable cross-attention from 2D to 3D pixel space, enabling the differentiation of points with similar image coordinates based on their depth coordinates. Building upon this module, we introduce a neural network named CGFormer to achieve semantic scene completion. Simultaneously, CGFormer leverages multiple 3D representations (i.e., voxel and TPV) to boost the semantic and geometric representation abilities of the transformed 3D volume from both local and global perspectives. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, attaining a mIoU of 16.87 and 20.05, as well as an IoU of 45.99 and 48.07, respectively.

    "abstract": "Providing functionality through articulation and interaction with objects is a key objective in 3D generation. We introduce MIDGArD (Modular Interpretable Diffusion over Graphs for Articulated Designs), a novel diffusion-based framework for articulated 3D asset generation. MIDGArD improves over foundational work in the field by enhancing quality, consistency, and controllability in the generation process. This is achieved through MIDGArD's modular approach that separates the problem into two primary components: structure generation and shape generation. The structure generation module of MIDGArD aims at producing coherent articulation features from noisy or incomplete inputs. It acts on the object's structural and kinematic attributes, represented as features of a graph that are being progressively denoised to issue coherent and interpretable articulation solutions. This denoised graph then serves as an advanced conditioning mechanism for the shape generation module, a 3D generative model that populates each link of the articulated structure with consistent 3D meshes. Experiments show the superiority of MIDGArD on the quality, consistency, and interpretability of the generated assets. Importantly, the generated models are fully simulatable, i.e., can be seamlessly integrated into standard physics engines such as MuJoCo, broadening MIDGArD's applicability to fields such as digital content creation, meta realities, and robotics",

    "abstract": "While neural networks (NNs) have a large potential as autonomous controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems, verifying the safety of neural network based control systems (NNCSs) poses significant challenges for the practical use of NNs— especially when safety is needed for unbounded time horizons. One reason for this is the intractability of analyzing NNs, ODEs and hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce VerSAILLE (Verifiably Safe AI via Logically Linked Envelopes): The first general approach that allows reusing control theory literature for NNCS verification. By joining forces, we can exploit the efficiency of NN verification tools while retaining the rigor of differential dynamic logic (dL). Based on a provably safe control envelope in dL, we derive a specification for the NN which is proven with NN verification tools. We show that a proof of the NN's adherence to the specification is then mirrored by a dL proof on the infinite-time safety of the NNCS.The NN verification properties resulting from hybrid systems typically contain nonlinear arithmetic over formulas with arbitrary logical structure while efficient NN verification tools merely support linear constraints. To overcome this divide, we present Mosaic: An efficient, sound and complete verification approach for polynomial real arithmetic properties on piece-wise linear NNs. Mosaic partitions complex NN verification queries into simple queries and lifts off-the-shelf linear constraint tools to the nonlinear setting in a completeness-preserving manner by combining approximation with exact reasoning for counterexample regions. In our evaluation we demonstrate the versatility of VerSAILLE and Mosaic: We prove infinite-time safety on the classical Vertical Airborne Collision Avoidance NNCS verification benchmark for some scenarios while (exhaustively) enumerating counterexample regions in unsafe scenarios. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms the State-of-the-Art tools in closed-loop NNV",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Accurate environment dynamics modeling is crucial for obtaining effective state representations in visual reinforcement learning (RL) applications. However, when facing multiple input modalities, existing dynamics modeling methods (e.g., DeepMDP) usually stumble in addressing the complex and volatile relationship between different modalities. In this paper, we study the problem of efficient dynamics modeling for multi-modal visual RL. We find that under the existence of modality heterogeneity, modality-correlated and distinct features are equally important but play different roles in reflecting the evolution of environmental dynamics. Motivated by this fact, we propose Dissected Dynamics Modeling (DDM), a novel multi-modal dynamics modeling method for visual RL. Unlike existing methods, DDM explicitly distinguishes consistent and inconsistent information across modalities and treats them separately with a divide-and-conquer strategy. This is done by dispatching the features carrying different information into distinct dynamics modeling pathways, which naturally form a series of implicit regularizations along the learning trajectories. In addition, a reward predictive function is further introduced to filter task-irrelevant information in both modality-consistent and inconsistent features, ensuring information integrity while avoiding potential distractions. Extensive experiments show that DDM consistently achieves competitive performance in challenging multi-modal visual environments",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We demonstrate that numerous machine learning algorithms are specific instances of one single paradigm: reciprocal learning. These instances range from active learning over multi-armed bandits to self-training. We show that all these algorithms not only learn parameters from data but also vice versa: They iteratively alter training data in a way that depends on the current model fit. We introduce reciprocal learning as a generalization of these algorithms using the language of decision theory. This allows us to study under what conditions they converge. The key is to guarantee that reciprocal learning contracts such that the Banach fixed-point theorem applies. In this way, we find that reciprocal learning converges at linear rates to an approximately optimal model under some assumptions on the loss function, if their predictions are probabilistic and the sample adaption is both non-greedy and either randomized or regularized. We interpret these findings and provide corollaries that relate them to active learning, self-training, and bandits",

    "title": "D-LLM: A Token Adaptive Computing Resource Allocation Strategy for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large language models have shown an impressive societal impact owing to their excellent understanding and logical reasoning skills. However, such strong ability relies on a huge amount of computing resources, which makes it difficult to deploy LLMs on computing resource-constrained platforms. Currently, LLMs process each token equivalently, but we argue that not every word is equally important. Some words should not be allocated excessive computing resources, particularly for dispensable terms in simple questions. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic inference paradigm for LLMs, namely D-LLMs, which adaptively allocate computing resources in token processing. We design a dynamic decision module for each transformer layer that decides whether a network unit should be executed or skipped. Moreover, we tackle the issue of adapting D-LLMs to real-world applications, specifically concerning the missing KV-cache when layers are skipped. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet effective eviction policy to exclude the skipped layers from subsequent attention calculations. The eviction policy not only enables D-LLMs to be compatible with prevalent applications but also reduces considerable storage resources. Experimentally, D-LLMs show superior performance, in terms of computational cost and KV storage utilization. It can reduce up to 45\\% computational cost and KV storage on Q\\&A, summarization, and math solving tasks, 50\\% on commonsense reasoning tasks",

    "abstract": "To address the challenges of sim-to-real gap and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning (RL), this work studies distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs) --- optimize the worst-case performance when the deployed environment is within an uncertainty set around some nominal MDP. Despite recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs has remained largely undetermined. While the statistical implications of distributional robustness in RL have been explored in some specific cases, the generalizability of the existing findings remains unclear, especially in comparison to standard RL. Assuming access to a generative model that samples from the nominal MDP, we examine the sample complexity of RMDPs using a class of generalized $L_p$ norms as the 'distance' function for the uncertainty set, under two commonly adopted $sa$-rectangular and $s$-rectangular conditions. Our results imply that RMDPs can be more sample-efficient to solve than standard MDPs using generalized $L_p$ norms in both $sa$- and $s$-rectangular cases, potentially inspiring more empirical research. We provide a near-optimal upper bound and a matching minimax lower bound for the $sa$-rectangular scenarios. For $s$-rectangular cases, we improve the state-of-the-art upper bound and also derive a lower bound using $L_\\infty$ norm that verifies the tightness",

    "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry has played a pivotal role in advancing proteomics, enabling the high-throughput analysis of protein composition in biological tissues. Despite the development of several deep learning methods for predicting amino acid sequences (peptides) responsible for generating the observed mass spectra, training data biases hinder further advancements of \\emph{de novo} peptide sequencing. Firstly, prior methods struggle to identify amino acids with Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) due to their lower frequency in training data compared to canonical amino acids, further resulting in unsatisfactory peptide sequencing performance. Secondly, various noise and missing peaks in mass spectra reduce the reliability of training data (Peptide-Spectrum Matches, PSMs). To address these challenges, we propose AdaNovo, a novel and domain knowledge-inspired framework that calculates Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) between the mass spectra and amino acids or peptides, using CMI for robust training against above biases.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Talking face generation (TFG) aims to animate a target identity's face to create realistic talking videos. Personalized TFG is a variant that emphasizes the perceptual identity similarity of the synthesized result (from the perspective of appearance and talking style). While previous works typically solve this problem by learning an individual neural radiance field (NeRF) for each identity to implicitly store its static and dynamic information, we find it inefficient and non-generalized due to the per-identity-per-training framework and the limited training data. To this end, we propose MimicTalk, the first attempt that exploits the rich knowledge from a NeRF-based person-agnostic generic model for improving the efficiency and robustness of personalized TFG. To be specific, (1) we first come up with a person-agnostic 3D TFG model as the base model and propose to adapt it into a specific identity; (2) we propose a static-dynamic-hybrid adaptation pipeline to help the model learn the personalized static appearance and facial dynamic features; (3) To generate the facial motion of the personalized talking style, we propose an in-context stylized audio-to-motion model that mimics the implicit talking style provided in the reference video without information loss by an explicit style representation. The adaptation process to an unseen identity can be performed in 15 minutes, which is 47 times faster than previous person-dependent methods. Experiments show that our MimicTalk surpasses previous baselines regarding video quality, efficiency, and expressiveness. Video samples are available at https://mimictalk.github.io",

Both types of work generally lead to large costs in training or synthesis.To reduce the cost, based on open-source available texts, we propose an efficient way that trains a small LLM for math problem synthesis, to efficiently generate sufficient high-quality pre-training data.To achieve it, we create a dataset using GPT-4 to distill its data synthesis capability into the small LLM.Concretely, we craft a set of prompts based on human education stages to guide GPT-4, to synthesize problems covering diverse math knowledge and difficulty levels.Besides, we adopt the gradient-based influence estimation method to select the most valuable math-related texts.The both are fed into GPT-4 for creating the knowledge distillation dataset to train the small LLM.We leverage it to synthesize 6 million math problems for pre-training our JiuZhang3.0 model.

However, existing VLMs face challenges in handling real-world applications with complex scenes and multiple objects, as well as aligning their focus with the diverse attention patterns of human users. In this paper, we introduce gaze information, feasibly collected by ubiquitous wearable devices such as MR glasses, as a proxy for human attention to guide VLMs. We propose a novel approach, Voila-A, for gaze alignment to enhance the effectiveness of these models in real-world applications. First, we collect hundreds of minutes of gaze data to demonstrate that we can mimic human gaze modalities using localized narratives. We then design an automatic data annotation pipeline utilizing GPT-4 to generate the VOILA-COCO dataset. Additionally, we introduce a new model VOILA-A that integrate gaze information into VLMs while maintain pretrained knowledge from webscale dataset. We evaluate Voila-A using a hold-out validation set and a newly collected VOILA-GAZE testset, which features real-life scenarios captured with a gaze-tracking device. Our experimental results demonstrate that Voila-A significantly outperforms several baseline models. By aligning model attention with human gaze patterns, Voila-A paves the way for more intuitive, user-centric VLMs and fosters engaging human-AI interaction across a wide range of applications",

Instead, for NAS to provide greater potential for fundamental design shifts, we need a novel expressive search space design which is built from more fundamental operations. To this end, we introduce einspace, a search space based on a parameterised probabilistic context-free grammar. Our space is versatile, supporting architectures of various sizes and complexities, while also containing diverse network operations which allow it to model convolutions, attention components and more. It contains many existing competitive architectures, and provides flexibility for discovering new ones. Using this search space, we perform experiments to find novel architectures as well as improvements on existing ones on the diverse Unseen NAS datasets. We show that competitive architectures can be obtained by searching from scratch, and we consistently find large improvements when initialising the search with strong baselines. We believe that this work is an important advancement towards a transformative NAS paradigm where search space expressivity and strategic search initialisation play key roles",

    "abstract": "A core aim in theoretical and systems neuroscience is to develop models which help us better understand biological intelligence. Such models range broadly in both complexity and biological plausibility. One widely-adopted example is task-optimized recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been used to generate hypotheses about how the brain's neural dynamics may organize to accomplish tasks. However, task-optimized RNNs typically have a fixed weight matrix representing the synaptic connectivity between neurons. From decades of neuroscience research, we know that synaptic weights are constantly changing, controlled in part by chemicals such as neuromodulators. In this work we explore the computational implications of synaptic gain scaling, a form of neuromodulation, using task-optimized low-rank RNNs.In our neuromodulated RNN (NM-RNN) model, a neuromodulatory subnetwork outputs a low-dimensional neuromodulatory signal that dynamically scales the low-rank recurrent weights of an output-generating RNN. In empirical experiments, we find that the structured flexibility in the NM-RNN allows it to both train and generalize with a higher degree of accuracy than low-rank RNNs on a set of canonical tasks.Additionally, via theoretical analyses we show how neuromodulatory gain scaling endows networks with gating mechanisms commonly found in artificial RNNs. We end by analyzing the low-rank dynamics of trained NM-RNNs, to show how task computations are distributed",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models, such as CLIP, have shown impressive generalization capacities when using appropriate text descriptions. While optimizing prompts on downstream labeled data has proven effective in improving performance, these methods entail labor costs for annotations and are limited by their quality. Additionally, since CLIP is pre-trained on highly imbalanced Web-scale data, it suffers from inherent label bias that leads to suboptimal performance. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a label-**F**ree p**ro**mpt distribution **l**earning and b**i**as **c**orrection framework, dubbed as **Frolic**, which boosts zero-shot performance without the need for labeled data. Specifically, our Frolic learns distributions over prompt prototypes to capture diverse visual representations and adaptively fuses these with the original CLIP through confidence matching.This fused model is further enhanced by correcting label bias via a label-free logit adjustment. Notably, our method is not only training-free but also circumvents the necessity for hyper-parameter tuning. Extensive experimental results across 16 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly outperforming the state-of-the-art by an average of $2.6\\%$ on 10 datasets with CLIP ViT-B/16 and achieving an average margin of $1.5\\%$ on ImageNet and its five distribution shifts with CLIP ViT-B/16.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in generating naturalistic images from textual inputs, and demonstrate the capacity to learn and represent complex visual-semantic relationships. While these diffusion models have achieved remarkable success, the underlying mechanisms driving their performance are not yet fully accounted for, with many unanswered questions surrounding what they learn, how they represent visual-semantic relationships, and why they sometimes fail to generalize. Our work presents Diffusion Partial Information Decomposition (DiffusionPID), a novel technique that applies information-theoretic principles to decompose the input text prompt into its elementary components, enabling a detailed examination of how individual tokens and their interactions shape the generated image. We introduce a formal approach to analyze the uniqueness, redundancy, and synergy terms by applying PID to the denoising model at both the image and pixel level. This approach enables us to characterize how individual tokens and their interactions affect the model output. We first present a fine-grained analysis of characteristics utilized by the model to uniquely localize specific concepts, we then apply our approach in bias analysis and show it can recover gender and ethnicity biases. Finally, we use our method to visually characterize word ambiguity and similarity from the model's perspective and illustrate the efficacy of our method for prompt intervention. Our results show that PID is a potent tool for evaluating and diagnosing text-to-image diffusion models. Link to project page: https://rbz-99.github.io/Diffusion-PID/",

    "abstract": "The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the \\textit{Relative Dominability} (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results.

However, most existing hashing methods are often limited by uncomprehensive feature representations and semantic associations, which greatly restricts their performance and applicability in practical applications. To deal with this challenge, in this paper, we propose an end-to-end graph attention network hashing (EGATH) for cross-modal retrieval, which can not only capture direct semantic associations between images and texts but also match semantic content between different modalities. We adopt the contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) combined with the Transformer to improve understanding and generalization ability in semantic consistency across different data modalities. The classifier based on graph attention network is applied to obtain predicted labels to enhance cross-modal feature representation. We construct hash codes using an optimization strategy and loss function to preserve the semantic information and compactness of the hash code. Comprehensive experiments on the NUS-WIDE, MIRFlickr25K, and MS-COCO benchmark datasets show that our EGATH significantly outperforms against several state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and uses 88.5\\% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1, in two competition leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction",

    "abstract": "We present a method for controlling a simulated humanoid to grasp an object and move it to follow an object's trajectory. Due to the challenges in controlling a humanoid with dexterous hands, prior methods often use a disembodied hand and only consider vertical lifts or short trajectories. This limited scope hampers their applicability for object manipulation required for animation and simulation. To close this gap, we learn a controller that can pick up a large number (>1200) of objects and carry them to follow randomly generated trajectories. Our key insight is to leverage a humanoid motion representation that provides human-like motor skills and significantly speeds up training. Using only simplistic reward, state, and object representations, our method shows favorable scalability on diverse objects and trajectories. For training, we do not need a dataset of paired full-body motion and object trajectories. At test time, we only require the object mesh and desired trajectories for grasping and transporting. To demonstrate the capabilities of our method, we show state-of-the-art success rates in following object trajectories and generalizing to unseen objects. Code and models will be released",

    "abstract": "Open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and their specialized variants, particularly Code LLMs, have recently delivered impressive performance. However, previous Code LLMs are typically fine-tuned on single-source data with limited quality and diversity, which may insufficiently elicit the potential of pre-trained Code LLMs. In this paper, we present AlchemistCoder, a series of Code LLMs with enhanced code generation and generalization capabilities fine-tuned on multi-source data. To achieve this, we pioneer to unveil inherent conflicts among the various styles and qualities in multi-source code corpora and introduce data-specific prompts with hindsight relabeling, termed AlchemistPrompts, to harmonize different data sources and instruction-response pairs. Additionally, we propose incorporating the data construction process into the fine-tuning data as code comprehension tasks, including instruction evolution, data filtering, and code review. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlchemistCoder holds a clear lead among all models of the same size (6.7B/7B) and rivals or even surpasses larger models (15B/33B/70B), showcasing the efficacy of our method in refining instruction-following capabilities and advancing the boundaries of code intelligence.

A major challenge therein is generating $K$ uniform Pareto-optimal solutions to represent the entire Pareto front.

However, directly specifying the optimal design that minimizes the fill distance is nearly intractable due to the nested $\\min-\\max-\\min$ optimization problem. To address this, we propose a surrogate ``max-packing'' design for the fill distance design, which is easier to optimize and leads to a rate-optimal design with a fill distance at most $4\\times$ the minimum value.

    "title": "SocialGPT: Prompting LLMs for Social Relation Reasoning via Greedy Segment Optimization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Social relation reasoning aims to identify relation categories such as friends, spouses, and colleagues from images. While current methods adopt the paradigm of training a dedicated network end-to-end using labeled image data, they are limited in terms of generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we first present a simple yet well-crafted framework named SocialGPT, which combines the perception capability of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within a modular framework, providing a strong baseline for social relation recognition. Specifically, we instruct VFMs to translate image content into a textual social story, and then utilize LLMs for text-based reasoning. SocialGPT introduces systematic design principles to adapt VFMs and LLMs separately and bridge their gaps. Without additional model training, it achieves competitive zero-shot results on two databases while offering interpretable answers, as LLMs can generate language-based explanations for the decisions. The manual prompt design process for LLMs at the reasoning phase is tedious and an automated prompt optimization method is desired. As we essentially convert a visual classification task into a generative task of LLMs, automatic prompt optimization encounters a unique long prompt optimization issue. To address this issue, we further propose the Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which performs a greedy search by utilizing gradient information at the segment level. Experimental results show that GSPO significantly improves performance, and our method also generalizes to different image styles. The code is available at https://github.com/Mengzibin/SocialGPT",

    "abstract": "In recent advancements in unsupervised visual representation learning, the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has emerged as a significant method for extracting visual features from unlabeled imagery through an innovative masking strategy. Despite its success, two primary limitations have been identified: the inefficacy of Exponential Moving Average (EMA) from I-JEPA in preventing entire collapse and the inadequacy of I-JEPA prediction in accurately learning the mean of patch representations. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces a novel framework, namely C-JEPA (Contrastive-JEPA), which integrates the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture with the Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization (VICReg) strategy. This integration is designed to effectively learn the variance/covariance for preventing entire collapse and ensuring invariance in the mean of augmented views, thereby overcoming the identified limitations. Through empirical and theoretical evaluations, our work demonstrates that C-JEPA significantly enhances the stability and quality of visual representation learning. When pre-trained on the ImageNet-1K dataset, C-JEPA exhibits rapid and improved convergence in both linear probing and fine-tuning performance metrics",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We present a detailed study of surrogate losses and algorithms for multi-label learning, supported by $H$-consistency bounds. We first show that, for the simplest form of multi-label loss (the popular Hamming loss), the well-known consistent binary relevance surrogate suffers from a sub-optimal dependency on the number of labels in terms of $H$-consistency bounds, when using smooth losses such as logistic losses. Furthermore, this loss function fails to account for label correlations. To address these drawbacks, we introduce a novel surrogate loss, *multi-label logistic loss*, that accounts for label correlations and benefits from label-independent $H$-consistency bounds. We then broaden our analysis to cover a more extensive family of multi-label losses, including all common ones and a new extension defined based on linear-fractional functions with respect to the confusion matrix. We also extend our multi-label logistic losses to more comprehensive multi-label comp-sum losses, adapting comp-sum losses from standard classification to the multi-label learning. We prove that this family of surrogate losses benefits from $H$-consistency bounds, and thus Bayes-consistency, across any general multi-label loss. Our work thus proposes a unified surrogate loss framework benefiting from strong consistency guarantees for any multi-label loss, significantly expanding upon previous work which only established Bayes-consistency and for specific loss functions. Additionally, we adapt constrained losses from standard classification to multi-label constrained losses in a similar way, which also benefit from $H$-consistency bounds and thus Bayes-consistency for any multi-label loss. We further describe efficient gradient computation algorithms for minimizing the multi-label logistic loss",

    "abstract": "Data valuation is a class of techniques for quantitatively assessing the value of data for applications like pricing in data marketplaces. Existing data valuation methods define a value for a discrete dataset. However, in many use cases, users are interested in not only the value of the dataset, but that of the distribution from which the dataset was sampled. For example, consider a buyer trying to evaluate whether to purchase data from different vendors. The buyer may observe (and compare) only a small preview sample from each vendor, to decide which vendor's data distribution is most useful to the buyer and purchase. The core question is how should we compare the values of data distributions from their samples? Under a Huber characterization of the data heterogeneity across vendors, we propose a maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)-based valuation method which enables theoretically principled and actionable policies for comparing data distributions from samples. We empirically demonstrate that our method is sample-efficient and effective in identifying valuable data distributions against several existing baselines, on multiple real-world datasets (e.g., network intrusion detection, credit card fraud detection) and downstream applications (classification, regression)",

The sampling for diffusion models is done by solving either the probability flow ODE or diffusion SDE wherein a neural network approximates the score function allowing a numerical ODE/SDE solver to be used. However, naive backpropagation techniques are memory intensive, requiring the storage of all intermediate states, and face additional complexity in handling the injected noise from the diffusion term of the diffusion SDE. We propose a novel family of bespoke ODE solvers to the continuous adjoint equations for diffusion models, which we call AdjointDEIS. We exploit the unique construction of diffusion SDEs to further simplify the formulation of the continuous adjoint equations using exponential integrators. Moreover, we provide convergence order guarantees for our bespoke solvers. Significantly, we show that continuous adjoint equations for diffusion SDEs actually simplify to a simple ODE. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AdjointDEIS for guided generation with an adversarial attack in the form of the face morphing problem.

Our algorithm is a private version of the algorithm of Diakonikolas et al. The algorithm of Diakonikolas et al uses the data itself to repeatedly discretize the real line so that --- when the two distributions are far apart in ${\\cal A}_k$-norm --- one of the discretized distributions exhibits large $L_2$-norm difference; and upon repeated sampling such large gap would be detected. Designing its private analogue poses two difficulties. First, our DP algorithm can not resample new datapoints as a change to a single datapoint may lead to a very large change in the descretization of the real line. In contrast, the (sorted) index of the discretization point changes only by $1$ between neighboring instances, and so we use a novel algorithm that set the discretization points using random Bernoulli noise, resulting in only a few buckets being affected under the right coupling. Second, our algorithm, which doesn't resample data, requires we also revisit the utility analysis of the original algorithm and prove its correctness w.r.t. the original sorted data; a problem we tackle using sampling a subset of Poisson-drawn size from each discretized bin. Lastly, since any distribution can be reduced to a continuous distribution, our algorithm is successfully carried to multiple other families of distributions and thus has numerous applications",

    "abstract": "Efficient computation of graph diffusion equations (GDEs), such as Personalized PageRank, Katz centrality, and the Heat kernel, is crucial for clustering, training neural networks, and many other graph-related problems. Standard iterative methods require accessing the whole graph per iteration, making them time-consuming for large-scale graphs. While existing local solvers approximate diffusion vectors through heuristic local updates, they often operate sequentially and are typically designed for specific diffusion types, limiting their applicability. Given that diffusion vectors are highly localizable, as measured by the participation ratio, this paper introduces a novel framework for approximately solving GDEs using a local diffusion process. This framework reveals the suboptimality of existing local solvers. Furthermore, our approach effectively localizes standard iterative solvers by designing simple and provably sublinear time algorithms. These new local solvers are highly parallelizable, making them well-suited for implementation on GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in quickly obtaining approximate diffusion vectors, achieving up to a hundred-fold speed improvement, and its applicability to large-scale dynamic graphs.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Human visual search ability enables efficient and accurate tracking of an arbitrary moving target, which is a significant research interest in cognitive neuroscience. The recently proposed Central-Peripheral Dichotomy (CPD) theory sheds light on how humans effectively process visual information and track moving targets in complex environments. However, existing visual object tracking algorithms still fall short of matching human performance in maintaining tracking over time, particularly in complex scenarios requiring robust visual search skills. These scenarios often involve Spatio-Temporal Discontinuities (i.e., STDChallenge), prevalent in long-term tracking and global instance tracking. To address this issue, we conduct research from a human-like modeling perspective: (1) Inspired by the CPD, we pro- pose a new tracker named CPDTrack to achieve human-like visual search ability. The central vision of CPDTrack leverages the spatio-temporal continuity of videos to introduce priors and enhance localization precision, while the peripheral vision improves global awareness and detects object movements. (2) To further evaluate and analyze STDChallenge, we create the STDChallenge Benchmark. Besides, by incorporating human subjects, we establish a human baseline, creating a high- quality environment specifically designed to assess trackers' visual search abilities in videos across STDChallenge. (3) Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CPDTrack not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in this challenge but also narrows the behavioral differences with humans. Additionally, CPDTrack exhibits strong generalizability across various challenging benchmarks. In summary, our research underscores the importance of human-like modeling and offers strategic insights for advancing intelligent visual target tracking.

    "title": "Mobile-Agent-v2: Mobile Device Operation Assistant with Effective Navigation via Multi-Agent Collaboration",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Mobile device operation tasks are increasingly becoming a popular multi-modal AI application scenario. Current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), constrained by their training data, lack the capability to function effectively as operation assistants. Instead, MLLM-based agents, which enhance capabilities through tool invocation, are gradually being applied to this scenario. However, the two major navigation challenges in mobile device operation tasks — task progress navigation and focus content navigation — are difficult to effectively solve under the single-agent architecture of existing work. This is due to the overly long token sequences and the interleaved text-image data format, which limit performance. To address these navigation challenges effectively, we propose Mobile-Agent-v2, a multi-agent architecture for mobile device operation assistance. The architecture comprises three agents: planning agent, decision agent, and reflection agent. The planning agent condenses lengthy, interleaved image-text history operations and screens summaries into a pure-text task progress, which is then passed on to the decision agent. This reduction in context length makes it easier for decision agent to navigate the task progress. To retain focus content, we design a memory unit that updates with task progress by decision agent. Additionally, to correct erroneous operations, the reflection agent observes the outcomes of each operation and handles any mistake accordingly. Experimental results indicate that Mobile-Agent-v2 achieves over a 30% improvement in task completion compared to the single-agent architecture of Mobile-Agent.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have greatly progressed in solving complex tasks. It communicates among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' collaborations are leveraged to perform multi-person tasks, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication towards effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "While time series diffusion models have received considerable focus from many recent works, the performance of existing models remains highly unstable. Factors limiting time series diffusion models include insufficient time series datasets and the absence of guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD). The framework of RATD consists of two parts: an embedding-based retrieval process and a reference-guided diffusion model. In the first part, RATD retrieves the time series that are most relevant to historical time series from the database as references. The references are utilized to guide the denoising process in the second part. Our approach allows leveraging meaningful samples within the database to aid in sampling, thus maximizing the utilization of datasets. Meanwhile, this reference-guided mechanism also compensates for the deficiencies of existing time series diffusion models in terms of guidance. Experiments and visualizations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in complicated prediction tasks.

    "title": "The Surprising Effectiveness of SP Voting with Partial Preferences",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of recovering the ground truth ordering (ranking, top-$k$, or others) over a large number of alternatives. The wisdom of crowd is a heuristic approach based on Condorcet's Jury theorem to address this problem through collective opinions.This approach fails to recover the ground truth when the majority of the crowd is misinformed. The \\emph{surprisingly popular} (SP) algorithm~\\citep{prelec2017solution} is an alternative approach that is able to recover the ground truth even when experts are in minority. The SP algorithm requires the voters to predict other voters' report in the form of a full probability distribution over all rankings of alternatives. However, when the number of alternatives, $m$, is large, eliciting the prediction report or even the vote over $m$ alternatives might be too costly. In this paper, we design a scalable alternative of the SP algorithm which only requires eliciting partial preferences from the voters, and propose new variants of the SP algorithm. In particular, we propose two versions---\\emph{Aggregated-SP} and \\emph{Partial-SP}---that ask voters to report vote and prediction on a subset of size $k$ ($\\ll m$) in terms of top alternative, partial rank, or an approval set. Through a large-scale crowdsourcing experiment on MTurk, we show that both of our approaches outperform conventional preference aggregation algorithms for the recovery of ground truth rankings, when measured in terms of Kendall-Tau distance and Spearman's $\\rho$. We further analyze the collected data and demonstrate that voters' behavior in the experiment, including the minority of the experts, and the SP phenomenon, can be correctly simulated by a concentric mixtures of Mallows model. Finally, we provide theoretical bounds on the sample complexity of SP algorithms with partial rankings to demonstrate the theoretical guarantees of the proposed methods",

    "title": "Flatten Anything: Unsupervised Neural Surface Parameterization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Surface parameterization plays an essential role in numerous computer graphics and geometry processing applications. Traditional parameterization approaches are designed for high-quality meshes laboriously created by specialized 3D modelers, thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. Moreover, their working mechanisms are typically restricted to certain simple topologies, thus relying on cumbersome manual efforts (e.g., surface cutting, part segmentation) for pre-processing. In this paper, we introduce the Flatten Anything Model (FAM), an unsupervised neural architecture to achieve global free-boundary surface parameterization via learning point-wise mappings between 3D points on the target geometric surface and adaptively-deformed UV coordinates within the 2D parameter domain. To mimic the actual physical procedures, we ingeniously construct geometrically-interpretable sub-networks with specific functionalities of surface cutting, UV deforming, unwrapping, and wrapping, which are assembled into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. Compared with previous methods, our FAM directly operates on discrete surface points without utilizing connectivity information, thus significantly reducing the strict requirements for mesh quality and even applicable to unstructured point cloud data. More importantly, our FAM is fully-automated without the need for pre-cutting and can deal with highly-complex topologies, since its learning process adaptively finds reasonable cutting seams and UV boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate the universality, superiority, and inspiring potential of our proposed neural surface parameterization paradigm.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "This paper concerns the problem of aligning samples from large language models to human preferences using *best-of-$n$* sampling, where we draw $n$ samples, rank them, and return the best one. We consider two fundamental problems. First: what is the relationship between best-of-$n$ and other (RLHF-type) approaches to aligning LLMs? In particular, when should one be preferred to the other? We show that the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution is essentially equivalent to the policy learned by RLHF if we apply a particular monotone transformation to the reward function. Moreover, we show that this transformation yields the best possible trade-off between win-rate against the base model vs KL distance from the base model. Then, best-of-$n$ is a Pareto-optimal win-rate vs KL solution.The second problem we consider is how to fine-tune a model to mimic the best-of-$n$ sampling distribution, to avoid drawing $n$ samples for each inference. We derive *BonBon Alignment* as a method for achieving this. Experiments show that BonBon alignment yields a model that achieves high win rates while minimally affecting off-target aspects of the generations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The remarkable capabilities and easy accessibility of large language models (LLMs) have significantly increased societal risks (e.g., fake news generation), necessitating the development of LLM-generated text (LGT) detection methods for safe usage. However, detecting LGTs is challenging due to the vast number of LLMs, making it impractical to account for each LLM individually; hence, it is crucial to identify the common characteristics shared by these models. In this paper, we draw attention to a common feature of recent powerful LLMs, namely the alignment training, i.e., training LLMs to generate human-preferable texts. Our key finding is that as these aligned LLMs are trained to maximize the human preferences, they generate texts with higher estimated preferences even than human-written texts; thus, such texts are easily detected by using the reward model (i.e., an LLM trained to model human preference distribution). Based on this finding, we propose two training schemes to further improve the detection ability of the reward model, namely (i) continual preference fine-tuning to make reward model prefer aligned LGTs even further and (ii) reward modeling of Human/LLM mixed texts (a rephrased texts from human-written texts using aligned LLMs), which serves as a median preference text corpus between LGTs and human-written texts to learn the decision boundary better. We provide an extensive evaluation by considering six text domains across twelve aligned LLMs, where our method demonstrates state-of-the-art results",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Learning Rate Warmup is a popular heuristic for training neural networks, especially at larger batch sizes, despite limited understanding of its benefits. Warmup decreases the update size $\\Delta \\mathbf{w}_t = \\eta_t \\mathbf{u}_t$ early in training by using lower values for the learning rate $\\eta_t$. In this work we argue that warmup benefits training by keeping the overall size of $\\Delta \\mathbf{w}_t$ limited, counteracting large initial values of $\\mathbf{u}_t$. Focusing on small-scale GPT training with AdamW/Lion, we explore the following question: *Why and by which criteria are early updates $\\mathbf{u}_t$ too large?* We analyze different metrics for the update size including the $\\ell_2$-norm, resulting directional change, and impact on the representations of the network, providing a new perspective on warmup. In particular, we find that warmup helps counteract large angular updates as well as a limited critical batch size early in training. Finally, we show that the need for warmup can be significantly reduced or eliminated by modifying the optimizer to explicitly normalize $\\mathbf{u}_t$ based on the aforementioned metrics",

    "abstract": "The vulnerability of deep neural networks to imperceptible adversarial perturbations has attracted widespread attention. Inspired by the success of vision-language foundation models, previous efforts achieved zero-shot adversarial robustness by aligning adversarial visual features with text supervision. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to several issues, including heavy adaptation cost, suboptimal text supervision, and uncontrolled natural generalization capacity. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose a few-shot adversarial prompt framework where adapting input sequences with limited data makes significant adversarial robustness improvement. Specifically, we achieve this by providing adversarially correlated text supervision that is end-to-end learned from adversarial examples. We also propose a novel training objective that enhances the consistency of multi-modal features while encourages differentiated uni-modal features between natural and adversarial examples. The proposed framework gives access to learn adversarial text supervision, which provides superior cross-modal adversarial alignment and matches state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness with only 1\\% training data.

    "title": "UniSDF: Unifying Neural Representations for High-Fidelity 3D Reconstruction of Complex Scenes with Reflections",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Neural 3D scene representations have shown great potential for 3D reconstruction from 2D images. However, reconstructing real-world captures of complex scenes still remains a challenge. Existing generic 3D reconstruction methods often struggle to represent fine geometric details and do not adequately model reflective surfaces of large-scale scenes. Techniques that explicitly focus on reflective surfaces can model complex and detailed reflections by exploiting better reflection parameterizations. However, we observe that these methods are often not robust in real scenarios where non-reflective as well as reflective components are present. In this work, we propose UniSDF, a general purpose 3D reconstruction method that can reconstruct large complex scenes with reflections. We investigate both camera view as well as reflected view-based color parameterization techniques and find that explicitly blending these representations in 3D space enables reconstruction of surfaces that are more geometrically accurate, especially for reflective surfaces. We further combine this representation with a multi-resolution grid backbone that is trained in a coarse-to-fine manner, enabling faster reconstructions than prior methods. Extensive experiments on object-level datasets DTU, Shiny Blender as well as unbounded datasets Mip-NeRF 360 and Ref-NeRF real demonstrate that our method is able to robustly reconstruct complex large-scale scenes with fine details and reflective surfaces, leading to the best overall performance.

    "abstract": "Goal-directed planning presents a challenge for classical RL algorithms due to the vastness of the combinatorial state and goal spaces, while humans and animals adapt to complex environments, especially with diverse, non-stationary objectives, often employing intermediate goals for long-horizon tasks.Here, we propose a goal reduction mechanism for effectively deriving subgoals from arbitrary and distant original goals, using a novel loop-removal technique.The product of the method, called goal-reducer, distills high-quality subgoals from a replay buffer, all without the need for prior global environmental knowledge.Simulations show that the goal-reducer can be integrated into RL frameworks like Deep Q-learning and Soft Actor-Critic.It accelerates performance in both discrete and continuous action space tasks, such as grid world navigation and robotic arm manipulation, relative to the corresponding standard RL models.Moreover, the goal-reducer, when combined with a local policy, without iterative training, outperforms its integrated deep RL counterparts in solving a navigation task.This goal reduction mechanism also models human problem-solving.Comparing the model's performance and activation with human behavior and fMRI data in a treasure hunting task, we found matching representational patterns between an goal-reducer agent's components and corresponding human brain areas, particularly the vmPFC and basal ganglia. The results suggest that humans may use a similar computational framework for goal-directed behaviors",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Current post-training quantization methods for LLMs compress the weights down to 4-bits, with moderate to low degradation in accuracy. However, further reducing the number of bits or accelerating the network while avoiding large accuracy drops, especially for smaller, sub 7B models, remains an actively researched and open problem. To address this, in this work, we introduce Quantization with Binary Bases (QBB), a new approach for low-bit quantization that effectively removes (nearly) all multiplications, reducing the implementation to summations. Our novel approach works by decomposing the original weights into a set of binary (1-bit) matrices using an iterative process. For a given layer, starting from a weight matrix, we first construct an initial approximation using an analytical solution, where each new binary matrix, paired with a scaling vector, approximates the residual error of the previous estimation. Secondly, using gradient descent and a progressive learning curriculum, we find the optimal set of binary matrices and scaling vectors that minimize the $\\ell_2$ distance between the produced approximation and original weights. Thirdly, as previous steps are input agnostic, we holistically optimize the scaling vectors alone, calibrating them in student-teacher fashion, with the teacher providing both the data, by autoregressive generation starting from a random token, and the target logits. When evaluated across multiple LLM families, our approach matches and outperforms all prior works, setting a new state-of-the-art result using a summation-only based approach",

    "abstract": "Continual learning of partially similar tasks poses a challenge for artificial neural networks, as task similarity presents both an opportunity for knowledge transfer and a risk of interference and catastrophic forgetting.However, it remains unclear how task similarity in input features and readout patterns influences knowledge transfer and forgetting, as well as how they interact with common algorithms for continual learning.Here, we develop a linear teacher-student model with latent structure and show analytically that high input feature similarity coupled with low readout similarity is catastrophic for both knowledge transfer and retention. Conversely, the opposite scenario is relatively benign. Our analysis further reveals that task-dependent activity gating improves knowledge retention at the expense of transfer, while task-dependent plasticity gating does not affect either retention or transfer performance at the over-parameterized limit. In contrast, weight regularization based on the Fisher information metric significantly improves retention, regardless of task similarity, without compromising transfer performance. Nevertheless, its diagonal approximation and regularization in the Euclidean space are much less robust against task similarity. We demonstrate consistent results in a permuted MNIST task with latent variables. Overall, this work provides insights into when continual learning is difficult and how to mitigate it",

    "title": "KV Cache is 1 Bit Per Channel: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Coupled Quantization",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires batching multiple requests together to improve throughput. As batch size, context length, or model size increases, the size of key and value (KV) cache quickly becomes the main contributor to GPU memory usage and the bottleneck of inference latency and throughput. Quantization has emerged as an effective technique for KV cache compression, but existing methods still fail at very low bit widths. Currently, KV cache quantization is performed per-channel or per-token independently. Our analysis shows that distinct channels of a key/value activation embedding are highly interdependent, and the joint entropy of multiple channels grows at a slower rate than the sum of their marginal entropy, which implies that per-channel independent quantization is sub-optimal. To mitigate this sub-optimality, we propose Coupled Quantization (CQ), which couples multiple key/value channels together for quantization to exploit their interdependence and encode the activations in a more information-efficient manner. Extensive experiments reveal that CQ compares favorably with existing baselines in preserving model quality, and improves inference throughput by 1.4–3.5$\\times$ relative to the uncompressed baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CQ can preserve model quality reasonably with KV cache quantized down to 1 bit",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Phenotype imputation plays a crucial role in improving comprehensive and accurate medical evaluation, which in turn can optimize patient treatment and bolster the reliability of clinical research. Despite the adoption of various techniques, multi-modal biological data, which can provide crucial insights into a patient's overall health, is often overlooked. With multi-modal biological data, patient characterization can be enriched from two distinct views: the biological view and the phenotype view. However, the heterogeneity and imprecise nature of the multimodal data still pose challenges in developing an effective method to model from two views. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to incorporate multi-modal biological data via view decoupling. Specifically, we segregate the modeling of biological data from phenotype data in a graph-based learning framework. From the biological view, the latent factors in biological data are discovered to model patient correlation. From the phenotype view, phenotype co-occurrence can be modeled to reveal patterns across patients. Then patients are encoded from these two distinct views. To mitigate the influence of noise and irrelevant information in biological data, we devise a cross-view contrastive knowledge distillation aimed at distilling insights from the biological view to enhance phenotype imputation. We show that phenotype imputation with the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the real-world biomedical database",

Information constraint distributed goodness-of-fit testing is a problem that has received considerable attention recently.

In a federated setting, however, data is distributed across multiple \"locations\" (e.g. servers) and cannot readily be shared due to e.g. bandwidth or privacy constraints that each server needs to satisfy. We show how recently derived results for goodness-of-fit testing for the mean of a multivariate Gaussian model extend to the discrete distributions, by leveraging Le Cam's theory of statistical equivalence.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in prompt optimization have notably enhanced the performance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks. However, the potential of optimized prompts on domain generalization has been under-explored. To explore the nature of prompt generalization on unknown domains, we conduct pilot experiments and find that (i) Prompts gaining more attention weight from PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable and (ii) Prompts with more stable attention distributions in PLMs' deep layers are more generalizable. Thus, we offer a fresh objective towards domain-generalizable prompts optimization named ''Concentration'', which represents the ''lookback'' attention from the current decoding token to the prompt tokens, to increase the attention strength on prompts and reduce the fluctuation of attention distribution.We adapt this new objective to popular soft prompt and hard prompt optimization methods, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our idea improves comparison prompt optimization methods by 1.42% for soft prompt generalization and 2.16% for hard prompt generalization in accuracy on the multi-source domain generalization setting, while maintaining satisfying in-domain performance. The promising results validate the effectiveness of our proposed prompt optimization objective and provide key insights into domain-generalizable prompts",

The key idea of our work is to (1) allow automatic generation of Feint behaviors via Palindrome-directed templates, combine them into meaningful behavior sequences via a Dual-Behavior Model; (2) concertize the implications from our formalization of Feint on game strategies, in terms of temporal, spatial, and their collective impacts respectively; and (3) provide a unified implementation scheme of Feint behaviors in existing MARL frameworks.

To mitigate the threat, existing solutions attempted to search for backdoor triggers, which can be time-consuming when handling a large search space.

Inspired by this observation, we introduce LT-Defense, the first searching-free backdoor defense via exploiting the long-tailed effect. Specifically, LT-Defense employs a small set of clean examples and two metrics to distinguish backdoor-related features in the target model. Upon detecting a backdoor model, LT-Defense additionally provides test-time backdoor freezing and attack target prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LT-Defense in both detection accuracy and efficiency, e.g., in task-agnostic scenarios, LT-Defense achieves 98% accuracy across 1440 models with less than 1% of the time cost of state-of-the-art solutions",

HyperLogic can unveil multiple diverse rule sets, each capable of capturing heterogeneous patterns in data. This provides a simple yet effective method to increase model flexibility and preserve interpretability.

    "abstract": "Computing Jacobians with automatic differentiation is ubiquitous in many scientific domains such as machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, robotics and finance. Even small savings in the number of computations or memory usage in Jacobian computations can already incur massive savings in energy consumption and runtime. While there exist many methods that allow for such savings, they generally trade computational efficiency for approximations of the exact Jacobian.In this paper, we present a novel method to optimize the number of necessary multiplications for Jacobian computation by leveraging deep reinforcement learning (RL) and a concept called cross-country elimination while still computing the exact Jacobian. Cross-country elimination is a framework for automatic differentiation that phrases Jacobian accumulation as ordered elimination of all vertices on the computational graph where every elimination incurs a certain computational cost.Finding the optimal elimination order that minimizes the number of necessary multiplications can be seen as a single player game which in our case is played by an RL agent.We demonstrate that this method achieves up to 33% improvements over state-of-the-art methods on several relevant tasks taken from relevant domains.Furthermore, we show that these theoretical gains translate into actual runtime improvements by providing a cross-country elimination interpreter in JAX that can execute the obtained elimination orders",

We show that this concern manifests itself in the classical secretary problem in the learning-augmented setting---the state-of-the-art algorithm can have zero probability of accepting the best candidate, which we deem unfair, despite promising to accept a candidate whose expected value is at least $\\max\\{\\Omega (1) , 1 - O(\\varepsilon)\\}$ times the optimal value, where $\\varepsilon$ is the prediction error.We show how to preserve this promise while also guaranteeing to accept the best candidate with probability $\\Omega(1)$.

    "title": "Testably Learning Polynomial Threshold Functions",

    "abstract": "Rubinfeld \\& Vasilyan recently introduced the framework of *testable learning* as an extension of the classical agnostic model. It relaxes distributional assumptions which are difficult to verify by conditions that can be checked efficiently by a *tester*. The tester has to accept whenever the data truly satisfies the original assumptions, and the learner has to succeed whenever the tester accepts. We focus on the setting where the tester has to accept standard Gaussian data. There, it is known that basic concept classes such as halfspaces can be learned testably with the same time complexity as in the (distribution-specific) agnostic model. In this work, we ask whether there is a price to pay for testably learning more complex concept classes. In particular, we consider polynomial threshold functions (PTFs), which naturally generalize halfspaces. We show that PTFs of arbitrary constant degree can be testably learned up to excess error $\\varepsilon > 0$ in time $n^{\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}$. This qualitatively matches the best known guarantees in the agnostic model. Our results build on a connection between testable learning and *fooling*. In particular, we show that distributions that approximately match at least $\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)$ moments of the standard Gaussian fool constant-degree PTFs (up to error $\\varepsilon$). As a secondary result, we prove that a direct approach to show testable learning (without fooling), which was successfully used for halfspaces, cannot work for PTFs",

We build a biologically motivated and trainable neural network model of dynamics in the visual pathway, incorporating local, lateral, and feedforward synaptic connections, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and long-range top-down inputs conceptualized as low-rank modulations of the input-driven sensory responses by high-level areas. We study this ${\\bf D}$ynamical ${\\bf C}$ortical ${\\bf net}$work ($DCnet$) in a visual cue-delay-search task and show that the model uses its own cue representations to adaptively modulate its perceptual responses to solve the task, outperforming state-of-the-art DNN vision and LLM models. The model's population states over time shed light on the nature of contextual modulatory dynamics, generating predictions for experiments. We fine-tune the same model on classic psychophysics attention tasks, and find that the model closely replicates known reaction time results. This work represents a promising new foundation for understanding and making predictions about perturbations to visual processing in the brain",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in large neural networks, presenting a critical need for more efficient alternatives. Previous efforts to develop alternatives have focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices, and have neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, and Monarch, along with many novel structures. We develop a taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic properties, which provides insights into their scaling laws. Combining these insights with empirical evaluation, we identify a subset of structures that achieve equal or better performance than dense layers as a function of training compute. To further improve their compute efficiency, we develop a natural extension of these performant structures that convert them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts layer. The resulting layer significantly outperforms dense layers in compute-optimal training efficiency for GPT-2 language models",

    "title": "Diffusion-Inspired Truncated Sampler for Text-Video Retrieval",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Prevalent text-to-video retrieval methods represent multimodal text-video data in a joint embedding space, aiming at bridging the relevant text-video pairs and pulling away irrelevant ones. One main challenge in state-of-the-art retrieval methods lies in the modality gap, which stems from the substantial disparities between text and video and can persist in the joint space. In this work, we leverage the potential of Diffusion models to address the text-video modality gap by progressively aligning text and video embeddings in a unified space. However, we identify two key limitations of existing Diffusion models in retrieval tasks: The L2 loss does not fit the ranking problem inherent in text-video retrieval, and the generation quality heavily depends on the varied initial point drawn from the isotropic Gaussian, causing inaccurate retrieval. To this end, we introduce a new Diffusion-Inspired Truncated Sampler (DITS) that jointly performs progressive alignment and modality gap modeling in the joint embedding space. The key innovation of DITS is to leverage the inherent proximity of text and video embeddings, defining a truncated diffusion flow from the fixed text embedding to the video embedding, enhancing controllability compared to adopting the isotropic Gaussian. Moreover, DITS adopts the contrastive loss to jointly consider the relevant and irrelevant pairs, not only facilitating alignment but also yielding a discriminatively structured embedding. Experiments on five benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of DITS. We empirically find that DITS can also improve the structure of the CLIP embedding space.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Watermarking generative content serves as a vital tool for authentication, ownership protection, and mitigation of potential misuse. Existing watermarking methods face the challenge of balancing robustness and concealment. They empirically inject a watermark that is both invisible and robust and passively achieve concealment by limiting the strength of the watermark, thus reducing the robustness. In this paper, we propose to explicitly introduce a watermark hiding process to actively achieve concealment, thus allowing the embedding of stronger watermarks. To be specific, we implant a robust watermark in an intermediate diffusion state and then guide the model to hide the watermark in the final generated image. We employ an adversarial optimization algorithm to produce the optimal hiding prompt guiding signal for each watermark. The prompt embedding is optimized to minimize artifacts in the generated image, while the watermark is optimized to achieve maximum strength. The watermark can be verified by reversing the generation process. Experiments on various diffusion models demonstrate the watermark remains verifiable even under significant image tampering and shows superior invisibility compared to other state-of-the-art robust watermarking methods",

In this paper, we propose a Decision Language Model (DLM) for RMABs, enabling dynamic fine-tuning of RMAB policies in public health settings using human-language commands. We propose using LLMs as automated planners to (1) interpret human policy preference prompts, (2) propose reward functions as code for a multi-agent RMAB environment, and (3) iterate on the generated reward functions using feedback from grounded RMAB simulations. We illustrate the application of DLM in collaboration with ARMMAN, an India-based non-profit promoting preventative care for pregnant mothers, that currently relies on RMAB policies to optimally allocate health worker calls to low-resource populations. We conduct a technology demonstration in simulation using the Gemini Pro model, showing DLM can dynamically shape policy outcomes using only human prompts as input",

    "title": "FUG: Feature-Universal Graph Contrastive Pre-training for Graphs with Diverse Node Features",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), known for their effective graph encoding, are extensively used across various fields. Graph self-supervised pre-training, which trains GNN encoders without manual labels to generate high-quality graph representations, has garnered widespread attention. However, due to the inherent complex characteristics in graphs, GNNs encoders pre-trained on one dataset struggle to directly adapt to others that have different node feature shapes. This typically necessitates either model rebuilding or data alignment. The former results in non-transferability as each dataset need to rebuild a new model, while the latter brings serious knowledge loss since it forces features into a uniform shape by preprocessing such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To address this challenge, we propose a new Feature-Universal Graph contrastive pre-training strategy (FUG) that naturally avoids the need for model rebuilding and data reshaping. Specifically, inspired by discussions in existing work on the relationship between contrastive Learning and PCA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and discovered that PCA's optimization objective is a special case of that in contrastive Learning. We designed an encoder with contrastive constraints to emulate PCA's generation of basis transformation matrix, which is utilized to losslessly adapt features in different datasets. Furthermore, we introduced a global uniformity constraint to replace negative sampling, reducing the time complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, and by explicitly defining positive samples, FUG avoids the substantial memory requirements of data augmentation. In cross domain experiments, FUG has a performance close to the re-trained new models. The source code is available at: https://github.com/hedongxiao-tju/FUG",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Referenced-based scene stylization that edits the appearance based on a content-aligned reference image is an emerging research area. Starting with a pretrained neural radiance field (NeRF), existing methods typically learn a novel appearance that matches the given style. Despite their effectiveness, they inherently suffer from time-consuming volume rendering, and thus are impractical for many real-time applications. In this work, we propose ReGS, which adapts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for reference-based stylization to enable real-time stylized view synthesis. Editing the appearance of a pretrained 3DGS is challenging as it uses discrete Gaussians as 3D representation, which tightly bind appearance with geometry. Simply optimizing the appearance as prior methods do is often insufficient for modeling continuous textures in the given reference image. To address this challenge, we propose a novel texture-guided control mechanism that adaptively adjusts local responsible Gaussians to a new geometric arrangement, serving for desired texture details. The proposed process is guided by texture clues for effective appearance editing, and regularized by scene depth for preserving original geometric structure. With these novel designs, we show ReGs can produce state-of-the-art stylization results that respect the reference texture while embracing real-time rendering speed for free-view navigation",

    "abstract": "Generalization capabilities, or rather a lack thereof, is one of the most important unsolved problems in the field of robot learning, and while several large scale efforts have set out to tackle this problem, unsolved it remains. In this paper, we hypothesize that learning temporal action abstractions using latent variable models (LVMs), which learn to map data to a compressed latent space and back, is apromising direction towards low-level skills that can readily be used for new tasks. Although several works have attempted to show this, they have generally been limited by architectures that do not faithfully capture sharable representations. To address this we present Quantized Skill Transformer (QueST), which learns a larger and more flexible latent encoding that is more capable of modeling the breadth of low-level skills necessary for a variety of tasks. To make use of this extra flexibility, QueST imparts causal inductive bias from the action sequence data into the latent space, leading to more semantically useful and transferable representations. We compare to state-of-the-art imitation learning and LVM baselines and see that QueST's architecture leads to strong performance on several multitask and few-shot learning benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and plan near-optimal control sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training distribution. We test our method on three tasks: 1D Burgers' equation, 2D jellyfish movement control, and 2D high-dimensional smoke control, where our generated jellyfish dataset is released as a benchmark for complex physical system control research. Our method outperforms widely applied classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Building on the success of diffusion models in visual generation, flow-based models reemerge as another prominent family of generative models that have achieved competitive or better performance in terms of both visual quality and inference speed. By learning the velocity field through flow-matching, flow-based models tend to produce a straighter sampling trajectory, which is advantageous during the sampling process. However, unlike diffusion models for which fast samplers are well-developed, efficient sampling of flow-based generative models has been rarely explored. In this paper, we propose a framework called FlowTurbo to accelerate the sampling of flow-based models while still enhancing the sampling quality. Our primary observation is that the velocity predictor's outputs in the flow-based models will become stable during the sampling, enabling the estimation of velocity via a lightweight velocity refiner. Additionally, we introduce several techniques including a pseudo corrector and sample-aware compilation to further reduce inference time. Since FlowTurbo does not change the multi-step sampling paradigm, it can be effectively applied for various tasks such as image editing, inpainting, etc. By integrating FlowTurbo into different flow-based models, we obtain an acceleration ratio of 53.1\\%$\\sim$58.3\\% on class-conditional generation and 29.8\\%$\\sim$38.5\\% on text-to-image generation. Notably, FlowTurbo reaches an FID of 2.12 on ImageNet with 100 (ms / img) and FID of 3.93 with 38 (ms / img), achieving the real-time image generation and establishing the new state-of-the-art.

Q-learning algorithms struggle with extrapolation errors in offline settings, while supervised learning methods are constrained by model expressiveness. Recently, diffusion models (DMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations in single-agent learning, but their application in multi-agent scenarios remains unclear. Generating trajectories for each agent with independent DMs may impede coordination, while concatenating all agents' information can lead to low sample efficiency. Accordingly, we propose MADiff, which is realized with an attention-based diffusion model to model the complex coordination among behaviors of multiple agents. To our knowledge, MADiff is the first diffusion-based multi-agent learning framework, functioning as both a decentralized policy and a centralized controller. During decentralized executions, MADiff simultaneously performs teammate modeling, and the centralized controller can also be applied in multi-agent trajectory predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that MADiff outperforms baseline algorithms across various multi-agent learning tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling complex multi-agent interactions",

However, the landscape of efficiently computable equilibria in sequential (extensive-form) games remains unknown. The Ellipsoid Against Hope does not apply directly to these games, because they do not have the required ``polynomial type'' property. Despite this barrier, \\citet{Huang2008:Computing} altered the algorithm to compute exact extensive-form correlated equilibria.In this paper, we generalize the Ellipsoid Against Hope and develop a simple algorithmic framework for efficiently computing saddle-points in bilinear zero-sum games, even when one of the dimensions is exponentially large. Moreover, the framework only requires a ``good-enough-response'' oracle, which is a weakened notion of a best-response oracle.Using this machinery, we develop a general algorithmic framework for computing exact linear $\\Phi$-equilibria in any polyhedral game (under mild assumptions), including correlated equilibria in normal-form games, and extensive-form correlated equilibria in extensive-form games. This enables us to give the first polynomial-time algorithm for computing exact linear-deviation correlated equilibria in extensive-form games, thus resolving an open question by \\citet{Farina2023:Polynomial}. Furthermore, even for the cases for which a polynomial time algorithm for exact equilibria was already known, our framework provides a conceptually simpler solution",

Unfortunately, directly searching for these influential images is computationally infeasible, since it would require repeatedly retraining models from scratch. In our work, we propose an efficient data attribution method by simulating unlearning the synthesized image. We achieve this by increasing the training loss on the output image, without catastrophic forgetting of other, unrelated concepts. We then identify training images with significant loss deviations after the unlearning process and label these as influential.

Recently, the remarkable zero-shot capabilities of the large pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) have made it popular for various downstream tasks. However, the effectiveness of this capacity often degrades when there are shifts in data distribution during testing compared to the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel method, known as CLIPCEIL, a model that utilizes Channel rEfinement and Image-text aLignment to facilitate the CLIP to the inaccessible $\\textit{out-of-distribution}$ test datasets that exhibit domain shifts. Specifically, we refine the feature channels in the visual domain to ensure they contain domain-invariant and class-relevant features by using a lightweight adapter. This is achieved by minimizing the inter-domain variance while maximizing the inter-class variance. In the meantime, we ensure the image-text alignment by aligning text embeddings of the class descriptions and their corresponding image embedding while further removing the domain-specific features. Moreover, our model integrates multi-scale CLIP features by utilizing a self-attention fusion module, technically implemented through one Transformer layer. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that CLIPCEIL outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

In such a case, CP's prediction sets are guaranteed to cover the (unknown) true test output with a user-specified probability. Nevertheless, this guarantee is violated when the data is subjected to adversarial attacks, which often result in a significant loss of coverage. Recently, several approaches have been put forward to recover CP guarantees in this setting. These approaches leverage variations of randomised smoothing to produce conservative sets which account for the effect of the adversarial perturbations. They are, however, limited in that they only support $\\ell_2$-bounded perturbations and classification tasks. This paper introduces VRCP (Verifiably Robust Conformal Prediction), a new framework that leverages recent neural network verification methods to recover coverage guarantees under adversarial attacks. Our VRCP method is the first to support perturbations bounded by arbitrary norms including $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$, and $\\ell_\\infty$, as well as regression tasks. We evaluate and compare our approach on image classification tasks (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet) and regression tasks for deep reinforcement learning environments. In every case, VRCP achieves above nominal coverage and yields significantly more efficient and informative prediction regions than the SotA",

    "title": "Ordering-Based Causal Discovery for Linear and Nonlinear Relations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Identifying causal relations from purely observational data typically requires additional assumptions on relations and/or noise. Most current methods restrict their analysis to datasets that are assumed to have pure linear or nonlinear relations, which is often not reflective of real-world datasets that contain a combination of both. This paper presents CaPS, an ordering-based causal discovery algorithm that effectively handles linear and nonlinear relations. CaPS introduces a novel identification criterion for topological ordering and incorporates the concept of \"parent score\" during the post-processing optimization stage. These scores quantify the strength of the average causal effect, helping to accelerate the pruning process and correct inaccurate predictions in the pruning step. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic data with varying ratios of linear and nonlinear relations. The results obtained from real-world data also support the competitiveness of CaPS. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/E2real/CaPS",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The field of graph learning has been substantially advanced by the development of deep learning models, in particular graph neural networks. However, one salient yet largely under-explored challenge is detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) nodes on graphs. Prevailing OOD detection techniques developed in other domains like computer vision, do not cater to the interconnected nature of graphs. This work aims to fill this gap by exploring the potential of a simple yet effective method -- OOD score propagation, which propagates OOD scores among neighboring nodes along the graph structure. This post hoc solution can be easily integrated with existing OOD scoring functions, showcasing its excellent flexibility and effectiveness in most scenarios. However, the conditions under which score propagation proves beneficial remain not fully elucidated. Our study meticulously derives these conditions and, inspired by this discovery, introduces an innovative edge augmentation strategy with theoretical guarantee. Empirical evaluations affirm the superiority of our proposed method, outperforming strong OOD detection baselines in various scenarios and settings",

We therefore explore training amortized models with noisy labels, and we find that this is inexpensive and surprisingly effective.

    "abstract": "Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted significant attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization across various tasks. However, its underlying principles remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze SAM's training dynamics using the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian as a measure of sharpness and propose a third-order stochastic differential equation (SDE), which reveals that the dynamics are driven by a complex mixture of second- and third-order terms. We show that alignment between the perturbation vector and the top eigenvector is crucial for SAM's effectiveness in regularizing sharpness, but find that this alignment is often inadequate in practice, which limits SAM's efficiency. Building on these insights, we introduce Eigen-SAM, an algorithm that explicitly aims to regularize the top Hessian eigenvalue by aligning the perturbation vector with the leading eigenvector. We validate the effectiveness of our theory and the practical advantages of our proposed approach through comprehensive experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/RitianLuo/EigenSAM",

    "abstract": "Large Reconstruction Models have made significant strides in the realm of automated 3D content generation from single or multiple input images. Despite their success, these models often produce 3D meshes with geometric inaccuracies, stemming from the inherent challenges of deducing 3D shapes solely from image data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, the Large Image and Point Cloud Alignment Model (LAM3D), which utilizes 3D point cloud data to enhance the fidelity of generated 3D meshes. Our methodology begins with the development of a point-cloud-based network that effectively generates precise and meaningful latent tri-planes, laying the groundwork for accurate 3D mesh reconstruction. Building upon this, our Image-Point-Cloud Feature Alignment technique processes a single input image, aligning to the latent tri-planes to imbue image features with robust 3D information. This process not only enriches the image features but also facilitates the production of high-fidelity 3D meshes without the need for multi-view input, significantly reducing geometric distortions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 6 seconds, and experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness",

    "abstract": "The effect of regularizers such as weight decay when training deep neural networks is not well understood. We study the influence of weight decay as well as $L2$-regularization when training neural network models in which parameter matrices interact multiplicatively. This combination is of particular interest as this parametrization is common in attention layers, the workhorse of transformers. Here, key-query, as well as value-projection parameter matrices, are multiplied directly with each other: $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$. We extend previous results and show on one hand that any local minimum of a $L2$-regularized loss of the form $L(AB^\\top) + \\lambda (\\|A\\|^2 + \\|B\\|^2)$ coincides with a minimum of the nuclear norm-regularized loss $L(AB^\\top) + \\lambda\\|AB^\\top\\|_*$, and on the other hand that the 2 losses become identical exponentially quickly during training. We thus complement existing works linking $L2$-regularization with low-rank regularization, and in particular, explain why such regularization on the matrix product affects early stages of training.Based on these theoretical insights, we verify empirically that the key-query and value-projection matrix products $W_K^TW_Q, PW_V$ within attention layers, when optimized with weight decay, as usually done in vision tasks and language modelling, indeed induce a significant reduction in the rank of $W_K^TW_Q$ and $PW_V$, even in fully online training.We find that, in accordance with existing work, inducing low rank in attention matrix products can damage language model performance, and observe advantages when decoupling weight decay in attention layers from the rest of the parameters",

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based methods significantly advance the exploration of associations among triple-wise biological entities (e.g., drug-target protein-adverse reaction), thereby facilitating drug discovery and safeguarding human health. However, existing researches only focus on entity-centric information mapping and aggregation, neglecting the crucial role of potential association patterns among different entities. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel association pattern-aware fusion method for biological entity relationship prediction, which effectively integrates the related association pattern information into entity representation learning. Additionally, to enhance the missing information of the low-order message passing, we devise a bind-relation module that considers the strong bind of low-order entity associations. Extensive experiments conducted on three biological datasets quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed method achieves about 4%-23% hit@1 improvements compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, the interpretability of association patterns is elucidated in detail, thus revealing the intrinsic biological mechanisms and promoting it to be deployed in real-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) on downstream tasks usually hinges on instruction tuning, which relies critically on the quality of training data. Unfortunately, collecting high-quality and diverse data is both expensive and time-consuming. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel Star-Agents framework, which automates the enhancement of data quality across datasets through multi-agent collaboration and assessment. The framework adopts a three-pronged strategy. It initially generates diverse instruction data with multiple LLM agents through a bespoke sampling method. Subsequently, the generated data undergo a rigorous evaluation using a dual-model method that assesses both difficulty and quality. Finaly, the above process evolves in a dynamic refinement phase, where more effective LLMs are prioritized, enhancing the overall data quality. Our empirical studies, including instruction tuning experiments with models such as Pythia and LLaMA, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Optimized datasets have achieved substantial improvements, with an average increase of 12\\% and notable gains in specific metrics, such as a 40\\% improvement in Fermi, as evidenced by benchmarks like MT-bench, Vicuna bench, and WizardLM testset.

    "abstract": "This work considers a practical semi-supervised graph anomaly detection (GAD) scenario, where part of the nodes in a graph are known to be normal, contrasting to the extensively explored unsupervised setting with a fully unlabeled graph. We reveal that having access to the normal nodes, even just a small percentage of normal nodes, helps enhance the detection performance of existing unsupervised GAD methods when they are adapted to the semi-supervised setting. However, their utilization of these normal nodes is limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Generative GAD approach (namely GGAD) for the semi-supervised scenario to better exploit the normal nodes. The key idea is to generate pseudo anomaly nodes, referred to as 'outlier nodes', for providing effective negative node samples in training a discriminative one-class classifier. The main challenge here lies in the lack of ground truth information about real anomaly nodes. To address this challenge, GGAD is designed to leverage two important priors about the anomaly nodes -- asymmetric local affinity and egocentric closeness -- to generate reliable outlier nodes that assimilate anomaly nodes in both graph structure and feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on six real-world GAD datasets are performed to establish a benchmark for semi-supervised GAD and show that GGAD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised GAD methods with varying numbers of training normal nodes",

This has sparked a research agenda to reducethese models' parameter counts and computational costs without significantlyimpacting their performance. Our study focuses on transformer-based LLMs,specifically targeting the computationally intensive feedforward networks (FFNs),which are less studied than attention blocks. We consider three structured linearparameterizations of the FFN using efficient low-rank and block-diagonal matrices.In contrast to many previous works that examined these approximations, our studyi) explores these structures from a training-from-scratch perspective, ii) scales upto 1.3B parameters, and iii) is conducted within recent Transformer-based LLMsrather than convolutional architectures. We demonstrate that these structures canlead to actual computational gains in various scenarios, including online decodingwhen using a pre-merge technique. Additionally, we propose a novel trainingregime, called self-guided training, aimed at improving the poor training dynamicsthat these approximations exhibit when used from initialization. Interestingly,the scaling performance of structured matrices is explored, revealing steepercurves in scaling training FLOPs, along with a favorable scaling trend in theovertraining regime. Specifically, we show that wide and structured networkscan utilize training FLOPs more efficiently, with fewer parameters and lowerloss than dense models at their optimal trade-off.

    "abstract": "We study a typical optimization model where the optimization variable is composed of multiple probability distributions. Though the model appears frequently in practice, such as for policy problems, it lacks specific analysis in the general setting. For this optimization problem, we propose a new structural condition/landscape description named generalized quasar-convexity (GQC) beyond the realms of convexity. In contrast to original quasar-convexity \\citep{hinder2020near}, GQC allows an individual quasar-convex parameter $\\gamma_i$ for each variable block $i$ and the smaller of $\\gamma_i$ implies less block-convexity. To minimize the objective function, we consider a generalized oracle termed as the internal function that includes the standard gradient oracle as a special case. We provide optimistic mirror descent (OMD) for multiple distributions and prove that the algorithm can achieve an adaptive $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}((\\sum_{i=1}^d1/\\gamma_i)\\epsilon^{-1})$ iteration complexity to find an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal global solution without pre-known the exact values of $\\gamma_i$ when the objective admits ``polynomial-like'' structural. Notably, it achieves iteration complexity that does not explicitly depend on the number of distributions and strictly faster $(\\sum_{i=1}^d 1/\\gamma_i \\text{ v.s. } d\\max_{i\\in[1:d]} 1/\\gamma_i)$ than mirror decent methods. We also extend GQC to the minimax optimization problem proposing the generalized quasar-convexity-concavity (GQCC) condition and a decentralized variant of OMD with regularization.

DNNs show remarkable generalization properties, yet the source of these capabilities remains elusive, defying the established statistical learning theory. Recent studies have revealed that properties of training trajectories can be indicative of generalization. Building on this insight, state-of-the-art methods have leveraged the topology of these trajectories, particularly their fractal dimension, to quantify generalization. Most existing works compute this quantity by assuming continuous- or infinite-time training dynamics, complicating the development of practical estimators capable of accurately predicting generalization without access to test data. In this paper, we respect the discrete-time nature of training trajectories and investigate the underlying topological quantities that can be amenable to topological data analysis tools. This leads to a new family of reliable topological complexity measures that provably bound the generalization error, eliminating the need for restrictive geometric assumptions. These measures are computationally friendly, enabling us to propose simple yet effective algorithms for computing generalization indices. Moreover, our flexible framework can be extended to different domains, tasks, and architectures. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new complexity measures exhibit a strong correlation with generalization error in industry-standard architectures such as transformers and deep graph networks. Our approach consistently outperforms existing topological bounds across a wide range of datasets, models, and optimizers, highlighting the practical relevance and effectiveness of our complexity measures",

In this work, we introduce $\\textit{weak-to-strong search}$, framing the alignment of a large language model as a test-time greedy search to maximize the log-probability difference between small tuned and untuned models while sampling from the frozen large model. This method serves both as (1) a compute-efficient model up-scaling strategy that avoids directly tuning the large model and as (2) an instance of weak-to-strong generalization that enhances a strong model with weak test-time guidance.Empirically, we demonstrate the flexibility of weak-to-strong search across different tasks. In controlled-sentiment generation and summarization, we use tuned and untuned $\\texttt{gpt2}$s to improve the alignment of large models without additional training. Crucially, in a more difficult instruction-following benchmark, AlpacaEval 2.0, we show that reusing off-the-shelf small models (e.g., $\\texttt{zephyr-7b-beta}$ and its untuned version) can improve the length-controlled win rates of both white-box and black-box large models against $\\texttt{gpt-4-turbo}$ (e.g., $34.4\\% \\rightarrow 37.9\\%$ for $\\texttt{Llama-3-70B-Instruct}$ and $16.0\\% \\rightarrow 20.1\\%$ for $\\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct}$), despite the small models' low win rates $\\approx 10.0\\%$",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Subset selection tasks, such as anomaly detection and compound selection in AI-assisted drug discovery, are crucial for a wide range of applications. Learning subset-valued functions with neural networks has achieved great success by incorporating permutation invariance symmetry into the architecture. However, existing neural set architectures often struggle to either capture comprehensive information from the superset or address complex interactions within the input. Additionally, they often fail to perform in scenarios where superset sizes surpass available memory capacity. To address these challenges, we introduce the novel concept of the Identity Property, which requires models to integrate information from the originating set, resulting in the development of neural networks that excel at performing effective subset selection from large supersets. Moreover, we present the Hierarchical Representation of Neural Subset Selection (HORSE), an attention-based method that learns complex interactions and retains information from both the input set and the optimal subset supervision signal. Specifically, HORSE enables the partitioning of the input ground set into manageable chunks that can be processed independently and then aggregated, ensuring consistent outcomes across different partitions. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HORSE significantly enhances neural subset selection performance by capturing more complex information and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in handling large-scale inputs by a margin of up to 20%",

    "title": "Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch: A Simple Layer for Improving Time-Series Representations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Existing approaches for learning representations of time-series keep the temporal arrangement of the time-steps intact with the presumption that the original order is the most optimal for learning. However, non-adjacent sections of real-world time-series may have strong dependencies. Accordingly, we raise the question: Is there an alternative arrangement for time-series which could enable more effective representation learning? To address this, we propose a simple plug-and-play neural network layer called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3) designed to improve representation learning in time-series models. S3 works by creating non-overlapping segments from the original sequence and shuffling them in a learned manner that is optimal for the task at hand. It then re-attaches the shuffled segments back together and performs a learned weighted sum with the original input to capture both the newly shuffled sequence along with the original sequence. S3 is modular and can be stacked to achieve different levels of granularity, and can be added to many forms of neural architectures including CNNs or Transformers with negligible computation overhead. Through extensive experiments on several datasets and state-of-the-art baselines, we show that incorporating S3 results in significant improvements for the tasks of time-series classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection, improving performance on certain datasets by up to 68\\%. We also show that S3 makes the learning more stable with a smoother training loss curve and loss landscape compared to the original baseline.

    "abstract": "Radar signal interpretation plays a crucial role in remote detection and ranging. With the gradual display of the advantages of neural network technology in signal processing, learning-based radar signal interpretation is becoming a research hot-spot and made great progress. And since radar semantic segmentation (RSS) can provide more fine-grained target information, it has become a more concerned direction in this field. However, the temporal information, which is an important clue for analyzing radar data, has not been exploited sufficiently in present RSS frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel temporal information learning paradigm, i.e., data-driven temporal information aggregation with learned target-history relations. Following this idea, a flexible learning module, called Temporal Relation-Aware Module (TRAM) is carefully designed. TRAM contains two main blocks: i) an encoder for capturing the target-history temporal relations (TH-TRE) and ii) a learnable temporal relation attentive pooling (TRAP) for aggregating temporal information. Based on TRAM, an end-to-end Temporal-Aware RSS Network (TARSS-Net) is presented, which has outstanding performance on publicly available and our collected real-measured datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes ProEdit - a simple yet effective framework for high-quality 3D scene editing guided by diffusion distillation in a novel progressive manner. Inspired by the crucial observation that multi-view inconsistency in scene editing is rooted in the diffusion model's large feasible output space (FOS), our framework controls the size of FOS and reduces inconsistency by decomposing the overall editing task into several subtasks, which are then executed progressively on the scene. Within this framework, we design a difficulty-aware subtask decomposition scheduler and an adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) training strategy, ensuring high efficiency in performing each subtask. Extensive evaluation shows that our ProEdit achieves state-of-the-art results in various scenes and challenging editing tasks, all through a simple framework without any expensive or sophisticated add-ons like distillation losses, components, or training procedures. Notably, ProEdit also provides a new way to preview, control, and select the aggressivity of editing operation during the editing process",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that large language models (LLMs) encode a vast reservoir of knowledge after being trained on mass data. Recent studies disclose knowledge conflicts in LLM generation, wherein outdated or incorrect parametric knowledge (i.e., encoded knowledge) contradicts new knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate such knowledge conflicts, we propose a novel framework, IRCAN (Identifying and Reweighting Context-Aware Neurons) to capitalize on neurons that are crucial in processing contextual cues. Specifically, IRCAN first identifies neurons that significantly contribute to context processing, utilizing a context-aware attribution score derived from integrated gradients. Subsequently, the identified context-aware neurons are strengthened via reweighting. In doing so, we steer LLMs to generate context-sensitive outputs with respect to the new knowledge provided in the context. Extensive experiments conducted across a variety of models and tasks demonstrate that IRCAN not only achieves remarkable improvements in handling knowledge conflicts but also offers a scalable, plug-and-play solution that can be integrated seamlessly with existing models.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI models have increased the integration of AI-based decision aids into the human decision making process. To fully unlock the potential of AI-assisted decision making, researchers have computationally modeled how humans incorporate AI recommendations into their final decisions, and utilized these models to improve human-AI team performance. Meanwhile, due to the ``black-box'' nature of AI models, providing AI explanations to human decision makers to help them rely on AI recommendations more appropriately has become a common practice. In this paper, we explore whether we can quantitatively model how humans integrate both AI recommendations and explanations into their decision process, and whether this quantitative understanding of human behavior from the learned model can be utilized to manipulate AI explanations, thereby nudging individuals towards making targeted decisions. Our extensive human experiments across various tasks demonstrate that human behavior can be easily influenced by these manipulated explanations towards targeted outcomes, regardless of the intent being adversarial or benign. Furthermore, individuals often fail to detect any anomalies in these explanations, despite their decisions being affected by them",

Many existing methods are based on StyleGAN to address this task. However, due to the limited spatial distribution of StyleGAN, it struggles with multiple hair color editing and facial preservation. Considering the advancements in diffusion models, we utilize Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) for hairstyle editing. Our approach introduces Multi-stage Hairstyle Blend (MHB), effectively separating control of hair color and hairstyle in diffusion latent space. Additionally, we train a warping module to align the hair color with the target region. To further enhance multi-color hairstyle editing, we fine-tuned a CLIP model using a multi-color hairstyle dataset. Our method not only tackles the complexity of multi-color hairstyles but also addresses the challenge of preserving original colors during diffusion editing. Extensive experiments showcase the superiority of our method in editing multi-color hairstyles while preserving facial attributes given textual descriptions and reference images",

    "abstract": "There has been significant interest in \"extreme\" compression of large language models (LLMs), i.e. to 1-2 bits per parameter, which allows such models to be executed efficiently on resource-constrained devices. Existing work focused on improved one-shot quantization techniques and weight representations; yet, purely post-training approaches are reaching diminishing returns in terms of the accuracy-vs-bit-width trade-off. State-of-the-art quantization methods such as QuIP# and AQLM include fine-tuning (part of) the compressed parameters over a limited amount of calibration data; however, such fine-tuning techniques over compressed weights often make exclusive use of straight-through estimators (STE), whose performance is not well-understood in this setting. In this work, we question the use of STE for extreme LLM compression, showing that it can be sub-optimal, and perform a systematic study of quantization-aware fine-tuning strategies for LLMs.We propose PV-Tuning - a representation-agnostic framework that generalizes and improves upon existing fine-tuning strategies, and provides convergence guarantees in restricted cases.On the practical side, when used for 1-2 bit vector quantization, PV-Tuning outperforms prior techniques for highly-performant models such as Llama and Mistral. Using PV-Tuning, we achieve the first Pareto-optimal quantization for Llama-2 family models at 2 bits per parameter",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "How do brain circuits learn to generate behaviour? While significant strides have been made in understanding learning in artificial neural networks, applying this knowledge to biological networks remains challenging. For instance, while backpropagation is known to perform accurate credit assignment of error in artificial neural networks, how a similarly powerful process can be realized within the constraints of biological circuits remains largely unclear. One of the major challenges is that the brain's extensive recurrent connectivity requires the propagation of error through both space and time, a problem that is notoriously difficult to solve in vanilla recurrent neural networks. Moreover, the extensive feedback connections in the brain are known to influence forward network activity, but the interaction between feedback-driven activity changes and local, synaptic plasticity-based learning is not fully understood. Building on our previous work modelling motor learning, this work investigates the mechanistic properties of pre-trained networks with feedback control on a standard motor task. We show that feedback control of the ongoing recurrent network dynamics approximates the optimal first-order gradient with respect to the network activities, allowing for rapid, ongoing movement correction. Moreover, we show that trial-by-trial adaptation to a persistent perturbation using a local, biologically plausible learning rule that integrates recent activity and error feedback is both more accurate and more efficient with feedback control during learning, due to the decoupling of the recurrent network dynamics and the injection of an adaptive, second-order gradient into the network dynamics. Thus, our results suggest that feedback control may guide credit assignment in biological recurrent neural networks, enabling both rapid and efficient learning in the brain",

Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (∼ 9 million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans.

To address this, we introduce Self Logits Evolution Decoding (SLED), a novel decoding framework that enhances the truthfulness of LLMs without relying on external knowledge bases or requiring further fine-tuning. From an optimization perspective, our SLED framework leverages the latent knowledge embedded within the LLM by contrasting the output logits from the final layer with those from early layers. It then utilizes an approximate gradient approach to enable latent knowledge to guide the self-refinement of outputs, thereby effectively improving factual accuracy. Extensive experiments have been conducted on established benchmarks across a diverse range of model families (LLaMA 2, LLaMA 3, Gemma) and scales (from 2B to 70B), including more advanced architectural configurations such as the mixture of experts (MoE). Our evaluation spans a wide variety of tasks, including multi-choice, open-generation, and adaptations to chain-of-thought reasoning tasks. The results demonstrate that SLED consistently improves factual accuracy by up to 20\\% compared to existing decoding methods while maintaining natural language fluency and negligible latency overhead.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Despite the general capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4, these models still request fine-tuning or adaptation with customized data when meeting the specific business demands and intricacies of tailored use cases. However, this process inevitably introduces new safety threats, particularly against the Fine-tuning based Jailbreak Attack (FJAttack) under the setting of Language-Model-as-a-Service (LMaaS), where the model's safety has been significantly compromised by fine-tuning on users' uploaded examples that contain just a few harmful examples. Though potential defenses have been proposed that the service providers of LMaaS can integrate safety examples into the fine-tuning dataset to reduce safety issues, such approaches require incorporating a substantial amount of data, making it inefficient. To effectively defend against the FJAttack with limited safety examples under LMaaS, we propose the Backdoor Enhanced Safety Alignment method inspired by an analogy with the concept of backdoor attacks. In particular, service providers will construct prefixed safety examples with a secret prompt, acting as a \"backdoor trigger\". By integrating prefixed safety examples into the fine-tuning dataset, the subsequent fine-tuning process effectively acts as the \"backdoor attack\", establishing a strong correlation between the secret prompt and safety generations. Consequently, safe responses are ensured once service providers prepend this secret prompt ahead of any user input during inference. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that through the Backdoor Enhanced Safety Alignment with adding as few as 11 prefixed safety examples, the maliciously fine-tuned LLMs will achieve similar safety performance as the original aligned models without harming the benign performance. Furthermore, we also present the effectiveness of our method in a more practical setting where the fine-tuning data consists of both FJAttack examples and the fine-tuning task data",

The scene graph encodes the relationships between objects, groups and rooms with a LLM-friendly structure, for which we design a hierarchical chain-of-thought prompt to help LLM reason the goal location according to scene context by traversing the nodes and edges.Moreover, benefit from the scene graph representation, we further design a re-perception mechanism to empower the object navigation framework with the ability to correct perception error.We conduct extensive experiments on MP3D, HM3D and RoboTHOR environments, where SG-Nav surpasses previous state-of-the-art zero-shot methods by more than \\textbf{10\\%} SR on all benchmarks, while the decision process is explainable.

We provide the first PAC-Bayes bound capable of providing such rich information by bounding the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the empirical and true probabilities of a set of $M$ error types, which can either be discretized loss values for regression, or the elements of the confusion matrix (or a partition thereof) for classification. We transform our bound into a differentiable training objective. Our bound is especially useful in cases where the severity of different mis-classifications may change over time; existing PAC-Bayes bounds can only bound a particular pre-decided weighting of the error types.

    "title": "Can Graph Learning Improve Planning in LLM-based Agents?",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Task planning in language agents is emerging as an important research topic alongside the development of large language models (LLMs). It aims to break down complex user requests in natural language into solvable sub-tasks, thereby fulfilling the original requests. In this context, the sub-tasks can be naturally viewed as a graph, where the nodes represent the sub-tasks, and the edges denote the dependencies among them. Consequently, task planning is a decision-making problem that involves selecting a connected path or subgraph within the corresponding graph and invoking it. In this paper, we explore graph learning-based methods for task planning, a direction that is orthogonal to the prevalent focus on prompt design. Our interest in graph learning stems from a theoretical discovery: the biases of attention and auto-regressive loss impede LLMs' ability to effectively navigate decision-making on graphs, which is adeptly addressed by graph neural networks (GNNs). This theoretical insight led us to integrate GNNs with LLMs to enhance overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GNN-based methods surpass existing solutions even without training, and minimal training can further enhance their performance. The performance gain increases with a larger task graph size",

    "title": "Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS).Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In diffusion models, samples are generated through an iterative refinement process, requiring hundreds of sequential model evaluations. Several recent methods have introduced approximations (fewer discretization steps or distillation) to trade off speed at the cost of sample quality. In contrast, we introduce Self-Refining Diffusion Samplers (SRDS) that retain sample quality and can improve latency at the cost of additional parallel compute. We take inspiration from the Parareal algorithm, a popular numerical method for parallel-in-time integration of differential equations. In SRDS, a quick but rough estimate of a sample is first created and then iteratively refined in parallel through Parareal iterations. SRDS is not only guaranteed to accurately solve the ODE and converge to the serial solution but also benefits from parallelization across the diffusion trajectory, enabling batched inference and pipelining. As we demonstrate for pre-trained diffusion models, the early convergence of this refinement procedure drastically reduces the number of steps required to produce a sample, speeding up generation for instance by up to 1.7x on a 25-step StableDiffusion-v2 benchmark and up to 4.3x on longer trajectories",

    "abstract": "While reinforcement learning (RL) holds great potential for decision making in the real world, it suffers from a number of unique difficulties which often need specific consideration. In particular: it is highly non-stationary; suffers from high degrees of plasticity loss; and requires exploration to prevent premature convergence to local optima and maximize return. In this paper, we consider whether learned optimization can help overcome these problems. Our method, Learned Optimization for Plasticity, Exploration and Non-stationarity (OPEN), meta-learns an update rule whose input features and output structure are informed by previously proposed solutions to these difficulties. We show that our parameterization is flexible enough to enable meta-learning in diverse learning contexts, including the ability to use stochasticity for exploration. Our experiments demonstrate that when meta-trained on single and small sets of environments, OPEN outperforms or equals traditionally used optimizers. Furthermore, OPEN shows strong generalization characteristics across a range of environments and agent architectures",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process.In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs.Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality.

In such architectures, to faithfully account for local structure such as cycles, the local operations must be equivariant to the automorphism group of the local environment. However, enumerating the automorphism groups of all subgraphs of interest and finding appropriate equivariant operations for each one of them separately is generally not feasible. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on spectral graph theory that bypasses having to determine the automorphism group entirely and constructs a basis for equivariant operations directly from the graph Laplacian.

Visual prompt tuning is introduced as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method to this trend. Despite its successes, a notable research challenge persists within almost all PEFT approaches: significant performance degradation is observed when there is a substantial disparity between the datasets applied in pretraining and finetuning phases. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from human visual cognition, and propose the Visual Fourier Prompt Tuning (VFPT) method as a general and effective solution for adapting large-scale transformer-based models. Our approach innovatively incorporates the Fast Fourier Transform into prompt embeddings and harmoniously considers both spatial and frequency domain information. Apart from its inherent simplicity and intuitiveness, VFPT exhibits superior performance across all datasets, offering a general solution to dataset challenges, irrespective of data disparities. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks, with low parameter usage (e.g., 0.57% of model parameters on VTAB-1k) and notable performance enhancements (e.g., 73.20% of mean accuracy on VTAB-1k).

    "abstract": "When training node embedding models to represent large directed graphs (digraphs), it is impossible to observe all entries of the adjacency matrix during training. As a consequence most methods employ sampling. For very large digraphs, however, this means many (most) entries may be unobserved during training. In general, observing every entry would be necessary to uniquely identify a graph, however if we know the graph has a certain property some entries can be omitted - for example, only half the entries would be required for a symmetric graph. In this work, we develop a novel framework to identify a subset of entries required to uniquely distinguish a graph among all transitively-closed DAGs. We give an explicit algorithm to compute the provably minimal set of entries, and demonstrate empirically that one can train node embedding models with greater efficiency and performance, provided the energy function has an appropriate inductive bias. We achieve robust performance on synthetic hierarchies and a larger real-world taxonomy, observing improved convergence rates in a resource-constrained setting while reducing the set of training examples by as much as 99%",

While the utility of encoding geometric structure has been demonstrated empirically, rigorous analysis of its impact on the learnability of neural networks is largely missing. Several recent results have established hardness results for learning feedforward and equivariant neural networks under i.i.d. Gaussian or uniform Boolean data distributions. In this paper, we investigate the hardness of learning under the manifold hypothesis. We ask, which minimal assumptions on the curvature and regularity of the manifold, if any, render the learning problem efficiently learnable. We prove that learning is hard under input manifolds of bounded curvature by extending proofs of hardness in the SQ and cryptographic settings for boolean data inputs to the geometric setting. On the other hand, we show that additional assumptions on the volume of the data manifold alleviate these fundamental limitations and guarantee learnability via a simple interpolation argument. Notable instances of this regime are manifolds which can be reliably reconstructed via manifold learning. Looking forward, we comment on and empirically explore intermediate regimes of manifolds, which have heterogeneous features commonly found in real world data",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Recent advancements in image understanding have benefited from the extensive use of web image-text pairs. However, video understanding remains a challenge despite the availability of substantial web video-text data. This difficulty primarily arises from the inherent complexity of videos and the inefficient language supervision in recent web-collected video-text datasets. In this paper, we introduce Text-Only Pre-Alignment (TOPA), a novel approach to extend large language models (LLMs) for video understanding, without the need for pre-training on real video data. Specifically, we first employ an advanced LLM to automatically generate Textual Videos comprising continuous textual frames, along with corresponding annotations to simulate real video-text data. Then, these annotated textual videos are used to pre-align a language-only LLM with the video modality. To bridge the gap between textual and real videos, we employ the CLIP model as the feature extractor to align image and text modalities. During text-only pre-alignment, the continuous textual frames, encoded as a sequence of CLIP text features, are analogous to continuous CLIP image features, thus aligning the LLM with real video representation. Extensive experiments, including zero-shot evaluation and finetuning on various video understanding tasks, demonstrate that TOPA is an effective and efficient framework for aligning video content with LLMs. In particular, without training on any video data, the TOPA-Llama2-13B model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 51.0% on the challenging long-form video understanding benchmark, Egoschema.

In this paper, the problem of multi-label open set recognition (MLOSR) is investigated, which poses significant challenges in classifying and recognizing instances with unknown labels in multi-label setting. To enable open set multi-label prediction, a novel approach named SLAN is proposed by leveraging sub-labeling information enriched by structural information in the feature space. Accordingly, unknown labels are recognized by differentiating the sub-labeling information from holistic supervision.

This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of learning a differentiable simulator of a physiological process. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct physiological measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining.

    "title": "SuperVLAD: Compact and Robust Image Descriptors for Visual Place Recognition",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Visual place recognition (VPR) is an essential task for multiple applications such as augmented reality and robot localization. Over the past decade, mainstream methods in the VPR area have been to use feature representation based on global aggregation, as exemplified by NetVLAD. These features are suitable for large-scale VPR and robust against viewpoint changes. However, the VLAD-based aggregation methods usually learn a large number of (e.g., 64) clusters and their corresponding cluster centers, which directly leads to a high dimension of the yielded global features. More importantly, when there is a domain gap between the data in training and inference, the cluster centers determined on the training set are usually improper for inference, resulting in a performance drop. To this end, we first attempt to improve NetVLAD by removing the cluster center and setting only a small number of (e.g., only 4) clusters. The proposed method not only simplifies NetVLAD but also enhances the generalizability across different domains. We name this method SuperVLAD. In addition, by introducing ghost clusters that will not be retained in the final output, we further propose a very low-dimensional 1-Cluster VLAD descriptor, which has the same dimension as the output of GeM pooling but performs notably better. Experimental results suggest that, when paired with a transformer-based backbone, our SuperVLAD shows better domain generalization performance than NetVLAD with significantly fewer parameters. The proposed method also surpasses state-of-the-art methods with lower feature dimensions on several benchmark datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/lu-feng/SuperVLAD",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Transformers and linear state space models can be evaluated in parallel on modern hardware, but evaluating nonlinear RNNs appears to be an inherently sequential problem. Recently, however, Lim et al. '24 developed an approach called DEER, which evaluates nonlinear RNNs in parallel by posing the states as the solution to a fixed-point problem. They derived a parallel form of Newton's method to solve the fixed-point problem and achieved significant speedups over sequential evaluation. However, the computational complexity of DEER is cubic in the state size, and the algorithm can suffer from numerical instability. We address these limitations with two novel contributions. To reduce the computational complexity, we apply quasi-Newton approximations and show they converge comparably to Newton, use less memory, and are faster. To stabilize DEER, we leverage a connection between the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and Kalman smoothing, which we call ELK. This connection allows us to stabilize Newton's method while using efficient parallelized Kalman smoothing algorithms to retain performance. Through several experiments, we show that these innovations allow for parallel evaluation of nonlinear RNNs at larger scales and with greater stability",

    "title": "3D Gaussian Rendering Can Be Sparser: Efficient Rendering via Learned Fragment Pruning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "3D Gaussian splatting has recently emerged as a promising technique for novel view synthesis from sparse image sets, yet comes at the cost of requiring millions of 3D Gaussian primitives to reconstruct each 3D scene. This largely limits its application to resource-constrained devices and applications.Despite advances in Gaussian pruning techniques that aim to remove individual 3D Gaussian primitives, the significant reduction in primitives often fails to translate into commensurate increases in rendering speed, impeding efficiency and practical deployment. We identify that this discrepancy arises due to the overlooked impact of fragment count per Gaussian (i.e., the number of pixels each Gaussian is projected onto). To bridge this gap and meet the growing demands for efficient on-device 3D Gaussian rendering, we propose fragment pruning, an orthogonal enhancement to existing pruning methods that can significantly accelerate rendering by selectively pruning fragments within each Gaussian. Our pruning framework dynamically optimizes the pruning threshold for each Gaussian, markedly improving rendering speed and quality. Extensive experiments in both static and dynamic scenes validate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, by integrating our fragment pruning technique with state-of-the-art Gaussian pruning methods, we achieve up to a 1.71$\\times$ speedup on an edge GPU device, the Jetson Orin NX, and enhance rendering quality by an average of 0.16 PSNR on the Tanks\\&Temples dataset.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Intent learning, which aims to learn users' intents for user understanding and item recommendation, has become a hot research spot in recent years. However, existing methods suffer from complex and cumbersome alternating optimization, limiting performance and scalability. To this end, we propose a novel intent learning method termed \\underline{ELCRec}, by unifying behavior representation learning into an \\underline{E}nd-to-end \\underline{L}earnable \\underline{C}lustering framework, for effective and efficient \\underline{Rec}ommendation. Concretely, we encode user behavior sequences and initialize the cluster centers (latent intents) as learnable neurons. Then, we design a novel learnable clustering module to separate different cluster centers, thus decoupling users' complex intents. Meanwhile, it guides the network to learn intents from behaviors by forcing behavior embeddings close to cluster centers. This allows simultaneous optimization of recommendation and clustering via mini-batch data. Moreover, we propose intent-assisted contrastive learning by using cluster centers as self-supervision signals, further enhancing mutual promotion. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses demonstrate the superiority of ELCRec from six perspectives. Compared to the runner-up, ELCRec improves NDCG@5 by 8.9\\% and reduces computational costs by 22.5\\% on the Beauty dataset. Furthermore, due to the scalability and universal applicability, we deploy this method on the industrial recommendation system with 130 million page views and achieve promising results.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot graph machine learning, especially with graph neural networks (GNNs), has garnered significant interest due to the challenge of scarce labeled data. While methods like self-supervised learning and graph prompt learning have been extensively explored, they often rely on fine-tuning with task-specific labels, limiting their effectiveness in zero-shot scenarios. Inspired by the zero-shot capabilities of instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework named Token Embedding-Aligned Graph Language Model (TEA-GLM) that leverages LLMs as cross-dataset and cross-task zero-shot learners for graph machine learning. Concretely, we pretrain a GNN, aligning its representations with token embeddings of an LLM. We then train a linear projector that transforms the GNN's representations into a fixed number of graph token embeddings without tuning the LLM. A unified instruction is designed for various graph tasks at different levels, such as node classification (node-level) and link prediction (edge-level). These design choices collectively enhance our method's effectiveness in zero-shot learning, setting it apart from existing methods. Experiments show that our graph token embeddings help the LLM predictor achieve state-of-the-art performance on unseen datasets and tasks compared to other methods using LLMs as predictors.

Here, a sequence of representations in the representation space is interpreted as a trajectory, and a curvature at each timestamp can be computed. Using the theory of random walk, we formally show that the mean curvature is lower near boundaries than at other points.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many real-world applications. Nonetheless, LLMs are often criticized for their tendency to produce hallucinations, wherein the models fabricate incorrect statements on tasks beyond their knowledge and perception. To alleviate this issue, graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has been extensively explored which leverages the factual knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) to ground the LLM's responses in established facts and principles. However, most state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source, making it challenging to develop a prompting framework that can efficiently and effectively integrate KGs into LLMs with hard prompts only. Generally, existing KG-enhanced LLMs usually suffer from three critical issues, including huge search space, high API costs, and laborious prompt engineering, that impede their widespread application in practice. To this end, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph based PrompTing framework, namely KnowGPT, to enhance LLMs with domain knowledge. KnowGPT contains a knowledge extraction module to extract the most informative knowledge from KGs, and a context-aware prompt construction module to automatically convert extracted knowledge into effective prompts. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that KnowGPT significantly outperforms all competitors. Notably, KnowGPT achieves a 92.6% accuracy on OpenbookQA leaderboard, comparable to human-level performance",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems.

We conduct downstream tasks of image classification and image-text retrieval on four medical datasets, where EGMA achieved state-of-the-art performance and stronger generalization across different datasets.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models represent a promising avenue for image generation, having demonstrated competitive performance in pose-guided person image generation. However, existing methods are limited to generating target images from a source image and a target pose, overlooking two critical user scenarios: generating multiple target images with different poses simultaneously and generating target images from multi-view source images.To overcome these limitations, we propose IMAGPose, a unified conditional framework for pose-guided image generation, which incorporates three pivotal modules: a feature-level conditioning (FLC) module, an image-level conditioning (ILC) module, and a cross-view attention (CVA) module. Firstly, the FLC module combines the low-level texture feature from the VAE encoder with the high-level semantic feature from the image encoder, addressing the issue of missing detail information due to the absence of a dedicated person image feature extractor. Then, the ILC module achieves an alignment of images and poses to adapt to flexible and diverse user scenarios by injecting a variable number of source image conditions and introducing a masking strategy.Finally, the CVA module introduces decomposing global and local cross-attention, ensuring local fidelity and global consistency of the person image when multiple source image prompts. The three modules of IMAGPose work together to unify the task of person image generation under various user scenarios.Extensive experiment results demonstrate the consistency and photorealism of our proposed IMAGPose under challenging user scenarios.

Specifically, we combine two classical algorithms---Nadaraya-Watson (NW) regression or kernel smoothing, and kernel ridge regression (KRR)---with KT to provide a quadratic speed-up in both training and inference times. We show how distribution compression with KT in each setting reduces to constructing an appropriate kernel, and introduce the Kernel-Thinned NW and Kernel-Thinned KRR estimators.

However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present single cell, Cell-ontology guided TFM (scCello). We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.

Nevertheless, it typically assumes multiple source domains simultaneously ready. It still remains an open problem to address EDG in the domain-incremental setting, where source domains are non-static and arrive sequentially to mimic the evolution of training domains. To this end, we propose Weight Diffusion (W-Diff), a novel framework that utilizes the conditional diffusion model in the parameter space to learn the evolving pattern of classifiers during the domain-incremental training process. Specifically, the diffusion model is conditioned on the classifier weights of different historical domain (regarded as a reference point) and the prototypes of current domain, to learn the evolution from the reference point to the classifier weights of current domain (regarded as the anchor point). In addition, a domain-shared feature encoder is learned by enforcing prediction consistency among multiple classifiers, so as to mitigate the overfitting problem and restrict the evolving pattern to be reflected in the classifier as much as possible. During inference, we adopt the ensemble manner based on a great number of target domain-customized classifiers, which are cheaply obtained via the conditional diffusion model, for robust prediction. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the superior generalization performance of W-Diff on unseen domains in the future",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We build interpretable and lightweight transformer-like neural networks by unrolling iterative optimization algorithms that minimize graph smoothness priors---the quadratic graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR) and the $\\ell_1$-norm graph total variation (GTV)---subject to an interpolation constraint. The crucial insight is that a normalized signal-dependent graph learning module amounts to a variant of the basic self-attention mechanism in conventional transformers. Unlike \"black-box\" transformers that require learning of large key, query and value matrices to compute scaled dot products as affinities and subsequent output embeddings, resulting in huge parameter sets, our unrolled networks employ shallow CNNs to learn low-dimensional features per node to establish pairwise Mahalanobis distances and construct sparse similarity graphs. At each layer, given a learned graph, the target interpolated signal is simply a low-pass filtered output derived from the minimization of an assumed graph smoothness prior, leading to a dramatic reduction in parameter count. Experiments for two image interpolation applications verify the restoration performance, parameter efficiency and robustness to covariate shift of our graph-based unrolled networks compared to conventional transformers",

    "title": "Sketching for Distributed Deep Learning: A Sharper Analysis",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "The high communication cost between the server and the clients is a significant bottleneck in scaling distributed learning for overparametrized deep models. One popular approach for reducing this communication overhead is randomized sketching. However, existing theoretical analyses for sketching-based distributed learning (sketch-DL) either incur a prohibitive dependence on the ambient dimension or need additional restrictive assumptions such as heavy-hitters. Nevertheless, despite existing pessimistic analyses, empirical evidence suggests that sketch-DL is competitive with its uncompressed counterpart, thus motivating a sharper analysis. In this work, we introduce a sharper ambient dimension-independent convergence analysis for sketch-DL using the second-order geometry specified by the loss Hessian. Our results imply ambient dimension-independent communication complexity for sketch-DL. We present empirical results both on the loss Hessian and overall accuracy of sketch-DL supporting our theoretical results. Taken together, our results provide theoretical justification for the observed empirical success of sketch-DL",

    "title": "Unified Covariate Adjustment for Causal Inference",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Causal effect identification and estimation are two crucial tasks in causal inference. Although causal effect identification has been theoretically resolved, many existing estimators only address a subset of scenarios, known as the sequential back-door adjustment (SBD) (Pearl and Robins, 1995) or g-formula (Robins, 1986). Recent efforts for developing general-purpose estimators with broader coverage, incorporating the front-door adjustment (FD) (Pearl, 2000) and more, lack scalability due to the high computational cost of summing over high-dimensional variables. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that achieves broad coverage of causal estimands beyond the SBD, incorporating various sum-product functionals like the FD, while maintaining scalability -- estimated in polynomial time relative to the number of variables and samples. Specifically, we present the class of UCA for which a scalable and doubly robust estimator is developed. In particular, we illustrate the expressiveness of UCA for a wide spectrum of causal estimands (e.g., SBD, FD, and more) in causal inference. We then develop an estimator that exhibits computational efficiency and doubly robustness. The scalability and robustness of the proposed framework are verified through simulations",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We develop a framework for analyzing the training and learning rate dynamics on a large class of high-dimensional optimization problems, which we call the high line, trained using one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with adaptive learning rates. We give exact expressions for the risk and learning rate curves in terms of a deterministic solution to a system of ODEs. We then investigate in detail two adaptive learning rates -- an idealized exact line search and AdaGrad-Norm -- on the least squares problem. When the data covariance matrix has strictly positive eigenvalues, this idealized exact line search strategy can exhibit arbitrarily slower convergence when compared to the optimal fixed learning rate with SGD. Moreover we exactly characterize the limiting learning rate (as time goes to infinity) for line search in the setting where the data covariance has only two distinct eigenvalues. For noiseless targets, we further demonstrate that the AdaGrad-Norm learning rate converges to a deterministic constant inversely proportional to the average eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix, and identify a phase transition when the covariance density of eigenvalues follows a power law distribution.

    "title": "Exploring Adversarial Robustness of Deep State Space Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Deep State Space Models (SSMs) have proven effective in numerous task scenarios but face significant security challenges due to Adversarial Perturbations (APs) in real-world deployments. Adversarial Training (AT) is a mainstream approach to enhancing Adversarial Robustness (AR) and has been validated on various traditional DNN architectures. However, its effectiveness in improving the AR of SSMs remains unclear.While many enhancements in SSM components, such as integrating Attention mechanisms and expanding to data-dependent SSM parameterizations, have brought significant gains in Standard Training (ST) settings, their potential benefits in AT remain unexplored. To investigate this, we evaluate existing structural variants of SSMs with AT to assess their AR performance. We observe that pure SSM structures struggle to benefit from AT, whereas incorporating Attention yields a markedly better trade-off between robustness and generalization for SSMs in AT compared to other components. Nonetheless, the integration of Attention also leads to Robust Overfitting (RO) issues.To understand these phenomena, we empirically and theoretically analyze the output error of SSMs under AP. We find that fixed-parameterized SSMs have output error bounds strictly related to their parameters, limiting their AT benefits, while input-dependent SSMs may face the problem of error explosion. Furthermore, we show that the Attention component effectively scales the output error of SSMs during training, enabling them to benefit more from AT, but at the cost of introducing RO due to its high model complexity.Inspired by this, we propose a simple and effective Adaptive Scaling (AdS) mechanism that brings AT performance close to Attention-integrated SSMs without introducing the issue of RO",
