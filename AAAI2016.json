    "title": "Predicting ICU Mortality Risk by Grouping Temporal Trends from a Multivariate Panel of Physiologic Measurements",
    "abstract": "ICU mortality risk prediction may help clinicians take effective interventions to improve patient outcome. Existing machine learning approaches often face challenges in integrating a comprehensive panel of physiologic variables and presenting to clinicians interpretable models. We aim to improve both accuracy and interpretability of prediction models by introducing Subgraph Augmented Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SANMF) on ICU physiologic time series. SANMF converts time series into a graph representation and applies frequent subgraph mining to automatically extract temporal trends. We then apply non-negative matrix factorization to group trends in a way that approximates patient pathophysiologic states. Trend groups are then used as features in training a logistic regression model for mortality risk prediction, and are also ranked according to their contribution to mortality risk. We evaluated SANMF against four empirical models on the task of predicting mortality or survival 30 days after discharge from ICU using the observed physiologic measurements between 12 and 24 hours after admission. SANMF outperforms all comparison models, and in particular, demonstrates an improvement in AUC (0.848 vs. 0.827, p<0.002) compared to a state-of-the-art machine learning method that uses manual feature engineering. Feature analysis was performed to illuminate insights and benefits of subgraph groups in mortality risk prediction",

    "abstract": "Survival prediction is crucial to healthcare research, but is confined primarily to specific types of data involving only the present measurements. This paper considers the more general class of healthcare data found in practice, which includes a wealth of intermittently varying historical measurements in addition to the present measurements. Making survival predictions on such data bristles with challenges to the existing prediction models. For this reason, we propose a new semi-proportional hazards model using locally time-varying coefficients, and a novel complete-data model learning criterion for coefficient optimization. Experiments on the healthcare data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our model and its promise in practical applications",

Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed. Specifically,  given content to display, the key elements of a good poster, including panel layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively labelled panels and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of our approach",

    "title": "Little Is Much: Bridging Cross-Platform Behaviors through Overlapped Crowds",
    "abstract": "People often use multiple platforms to fulfill their different information needs. With the ultimate goal of serving people intelligently, a fundamental way is to get comprehensive understanding about user needs. How to organically integrate and bridge cross-platform information in a human-centric way is important. Existing transfer learning assumes either fully-overlapped or non-overlapped among the users. However, the real case is the users of different platforms are partially overlapped. The number of overlapped users is often small and the explicitly known overlapped users is even less due to the lacking of unified ID for a user across different platforms. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised transfer learning method to address the problem of cross-platform behavior prediction, called XPTrans. To alleviate the sparsity issue, it fully exploits the small number of overlapped crowds to optimally bridge a user's behaviors in different platforms. Extensive experiments across two real social networks show that XPTrans significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that by fully exploiting 26% overlapped users, XPTrans can predict the behaviors of non-overlapped users with the same accuracy as overlapped users, which means the small overlapped crowds can successfully bridge the information across different platforms",

For makeup detector, a locality-constrained low-rank dictionary learning algorithm is used to determine and locate the usage of cosmetics. For the challenging task of makeup removal, a locality-constrained coupled dictionary learning (LC-CDL) framework is proposed to synthesize non-makeup face, so that the makeup could be erased according to the style. Moreover, we build a stepwise makeup dataset (SMU) which to the best of our knowledge is the first dataset with procedures of makeup. This novel technology itself carries many practical applications, e.g. products recommendation for consumers; user-specified makeup tutorial; security applications on makeup face verification. Finally, our system is evaluated on three existing (VMU, MIW, YMU) and one own-collected makeup datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of DL-based method on makeup detection. The proposed LC-CDL shows very promising performance on makeup removal regarding on the structure similarity. In addition, the comparison of face verification accuracy with presence or absence of makeup is presented, which illustrates an application of our automatic makeup remover system in the context of face verification with facial makeup",

    "title": "Social Role-Aware Emotion Contagion in Image Social Networks",
    "abstract": "Psychological theories suggest that emotion represents the state of mind and instinctive responses of one’s cognitive system (Cannon 1927). Emotions are a complex state of feeling that results in physical and psychological changes that influence our behavior. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of emotion contagion in social networks. In particular, by employing an image social network (Flickr) as the basis of our study, we try to unveil how users’ emotional statuses influence each other and how users’ positions in the social network affect their influential strength on emotion. We develop a probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a role-aware contagion model. The model is able to predict users’ emotional statuses based on their historical emotional statuses and social structures. Experiments on a large Flickr dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms (+31% in terms of F1-score) several alternative methods in predicting users’ emotional status. We also discover several intriguing phenomena. For example, the probability that a user feels happy is roughly linear to the number of friends who are also happy; but taking a closer look, the happiness probability is superlinear to the number of happy friends who act as opinion leaders (Page et al. 1999) in the network and sublinear in the number of happy friends who span structural holes (Burt 2001). This offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of emotional contagion in online social networks",

    "abstract": "Hospitals are typically optimized to operate near capacity, and there are serious concerns that our healthcare system is not prepared for the next pandemic. Stockpiles of different supplies, e.g., personal protective equipments (PPE) and medical equipment, need to be maintained in order to be able to respond to any future pandemics. Large outbreaks occur with a low probability, and such stockpiles require big investments. Further, hospitals often have mutual sharing agreements, which makes the problem of stockpiling decisions a natural game-theoretical problem. In this paper, we formalize hospital stockpiling as a game-theoretical problem. We use the notion of pairwise Nash stability as a solution concept for this problem, and characterize its structure. We show that stable strategies can lead to high unsatisfied demands in some scenarios, and stockpiles might not be maintained at all nodes. We also show that stable strategies and the social optimum can be computed efficiently",

    "abstract": "Time information plays a crucial role on social media popularity. Existing research on popularity prediction, effective though, ignores temporal information which is highly related to user-item associations and thus often results in limited success. An essential way is to consider all these factors (user, item, and time), which capture the dynamic nature of photo popularity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to factorize the popularity into user-item context and time-sensitive context for exploring the mechanism of dynamic popularity. The user-item context provides a holistic view of popularity, while the time-sensitive context captures the temporal dynamics nature of popularity. Accordingly, we develop two kinds of time-sensitive features, including user activeness variability and photo prevalence variability. To predict photo popularity, we propose a novel framework named Multi-scale Temporal Decomposition (MTD), which decomposes the popularity matrix in latent spaces based on contextual associations. Specifically, the proposed MTD models time-sensitive context on different time scales, which is beneficial to automatically learn temporal patterns. Based on the experiments conducted on a real-world dataset with 1.29M photos from Flickr, our proposed MTD can achieve the prediction accuracy of 79.8% and outperform the best three state-of-the-art methods with a relative improvement of 9.6% on average",

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) model shows promising performance comparing with PFMC and TF, but all these methods have problem in modeling continuous time interval and geographical distance. In this paper, we extend RNN and propose a novel method called Spatial Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (ST-RNN). ST-RNN can model local temporal and spatial contexts in each layer with time-specific transition matrices for different time intervals and distance-specific transition matrices for different geographical distances. Experimental results show that the proposed ST-RNN model yields significant improvements over the competitive compared methods on two typical datasets, i.e., Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Gowalla dataset",

How to efficiently share the underlying information and knowledge from reliable (usually highly-reputable) answerers has become an increasingly popular research topic. A major challenge in cQA tasks is the accurate matching of high-quality answers w.r.t given questions. Many of traditional approaches likely recommend corresponding answers merely depending on the content similarity between questions and answers, therefore suffer from the sparsity bottleneck of cQA data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which encodes not only the contents of question-answer(Q-A) but also the social interaction cues in the community to boost the cQA tasks. More specifically, our framework collaboratively utilizes the rich interaction among questions, answers and answerers to learn the relative quality rank of different answers w.r.t a same question. Moreover, the information in heterogeneous social networks is comprehensively employed to enhance the quality of question-answering (QA) matching by our deep random walk learning framework.

As a first step towards accomplishing this goal, we propose to automatically extract wellness events from users' published social contents. Existing approaches for event extraction are not applicable to personal wellness events due to its domain nature characterized by plenty of noise and variety in data, insufficient samples, and inter-relation among events.To tackle these problems, we propose an optimization learning framework that utilizes the content information of microblogging messages as well as the relations between event categories.

    "abstract": "The pervasive presence of social media greatly enriches online users' social activities, resulting in abundant social relations. Social relations provide an independent source for recommendation, bringing about new opportunities for recommender systems. Exploiting social relations to improve recommendation performance attracts a great amount of attention in recent years. Most existing social recommender systems treat social relations homogeneously and make use of direct connections (or strong dependency connections). However, connections in online social networks are intrinsically heterogeneous and are a composite of various relations. While connected users in online social networks form groups, and users in a group share similar interests, weak dependency connections are established among these users when they are not directly connected. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit the heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections for recommendation. In particular, we employ social dimensions to simultaneously capture heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections, and provide principled ways to model social dimensions, and propose a recommendation framework SoDimRec which incorporates heterogeneity of social relations and weak dependency connections based on social dimensions. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

We propose a novel nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model with two sets of parameters, the community membership matrix and community attribute matrix, and present efficient updating rules to evaluate the parameters with a convergence guarantee. The use of node attributes improves upon community detection and provides a semantic interpretation to the resultant network communities. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world networks not only show the superior performance of the new method over the state-of-the-art approaches, but also demonstrate its ability to semantically annotate the communities",

    "title": "Capturing Semantic Correlation for Item Recommendation in Tagging Systems",
    "abstract": "The popularity of tagging systems provides a great opportunity to improve the performance of item recommendation. Although existing approaches use topic modeling to mine the semantic information of items by grouping the tags labelled for items, they overlook an important property that tags link users and items as a bridge. Thus these methods cannot deal with the data sparsity without commonly rated items (DS-WO-CRI) problem, limiting their recommendation performance. Towards solving this challenging problem, we propose a novel tag and rating based collaborative filtering (CF) model for item recommendation, which first uses topic modeling to mine the semantic information of tags for each user and for each item respectively, and then incorporates the semantic information into matrix factorization to factorize rating information and to capture the bridging feature of tags and ratings between users and items.As a result, our model captures the semantic correlation between users and items, and is able to greatly improve recommendation performance, especially in DS-WO-CRI situations.Experiments conducted on two popular real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms the conventional CF approach, the state-of-the-art social relation based CF approach, and the state-of-the-art topic modeling based CF approaches in terms of both precision and recall, and it is an effective approach to the DS-WO-CRI problem",

    "title": "Cross-Lingual Taxonomy Alignment with Bilingual Biterm Topic Model",
    "abstract": "As more and more multilingual knowledge becomes available on the Web, knowledge sharing across languages has become an important task to benefit many applications. One of the most crucial kinds of knowledge on the Web is taxonomy, which is used to organize and classify the Web data. To facilitate knowledge sharing across languages, we need to deal with the problem of cross-lingual taxonomy alignment, which discovers the most relevant category in the target taxonomy of one language for each category in the source taxonomy of another language. Current approaches for aligning cross-lingual taxonomies strongly rely on domain-specific information and the features based on string similarities. In this paper, we present a new approach to deal with the problem of cross-lingual taxonomy alignment without using any domain-specific information. We first identify the candidate matched categories in the target taxonomy for each category in the source taxonomy using the cross-lingual string similarity. We then propose a novel bilingual topic model, called Bilingual Biterm Topic Model (BiBTM), to perform exact matching. BiBTM is trained by the textual contexts extracted from the Web. We conduct experiments on two kinds of real world datasets. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms the designed state-of-the-art comparison methods",

    "abstract": "Researchers have long converged that the evolution of a Social Networking Service (SNS) platform is driven by the interplay between users' preferences (reflected in user-item consumption behavior) and the social network structure (reflected in user-user interaction behavior), with both kinds of users' behaviors change from time to time. However, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in an isolated way or relied on a static assumption of a SNS. Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of users' historical preferences and the dynamic social network structure affect the evolution of SNSs.  Furthermore, can jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs benefit both behavior prediction tasks?In this paper, we leverage the underlying social theories(i.e., social influence and the homophily effect) to investigate the interplay and evolution of SNSs. We propose a probabilistic approach to fuse these social theories for jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs. Thus our proposed model has both the explanatory ability and predictive power. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model",

Our approach hinges upon the idea of ranking node popularities within communities and using a Bayesian method to shrink communities to optimize an objective function based on the stochastic generative model.

    "abstract": "Cross-modal hashing (CMH) is an efficient technique for the fast retrieval of web image data, and it has gained a lot of attentions recently. However, traditional CMH methods usually apply batch learning for generating hash functions and codes. They are inefficient for the retrieval of web images which usually have streaming fashion. Online learning can be exploited for CMH. But existing online hashing methods still cannot solve two essential problems: efficient updating of hash codes and analysis of cross-modal correlation. In this paper, we propose Online Cross-modal Hashing (OCMH) which can effectively address the above two problems by learning the shared latent codes (SLC). In OCMH, hash codes can be represented by the permanent SLC and dynamic transfer matrix. Therefore, inefficient updating of hash codes is transformed to the efficient updating of SLC and transfer matrix, and the time complexity is irrelevant to the database size. Moreover, SLC is shared by all the modalities, and thus it can encode the latent cross-modal correlation, which further improves the overall cross-modal correlation between heterogeneous data. Experimental results on two real-world multi-modal web image datasets: MIR Flickr and NUS-WIDE, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of OCMH for online cross-modal web image retrieval",

    "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT) conducts end-to-end translation with a source language encoder and a target language decoder, making promising translation performance. However, as a newly emerged approach, the method has some limitations. An NMT system usually has to apply a vocabulary of certain size to avoid the time-consuming training and decoding, thus it causes a serious out-of-vocabulary problem. Furthermore, the decoder lacks a mechanism to guarantee all the source words to be translated and usually favors short translations, resulting in fluent but inadequate translations. In order to solve the above problems, we incorporate statistical machine translation (SMT) features, such as a translation model and an n-gram language model, with the NMT model under the log-linear framework. Our experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves the translation quality of the state-ofthe-art NMT system on Chinese-to-English translation tasks. Our method produces a gain of up to 2.33 BLEU score on NIST open test sets",

    "abstract": "Image localization is important for marketing and recommendation of local business; however, the level of granularity is still a critical issue. Given a consumer photo and its rough GPS information, we are interested in extracting the fine-grained location information, i.e. business venues,  of the image. To this end, we propose a novel framework for business venue recognition. The framework mainly contains three parts. First, business-aware visual concept discovery: we mine a set of concepts that are useful for business venue recognition based on three guidelines including business awareness, visually detectable, and discriminative power. We define concepts that satisfy all of these three criteria as business-aware visual concept.  Second, business-aware concept detection by convolutional neural networks (BA-CNN): we propose a new network configuration that can incorporate semantic signals mined from business reviews for extracting semantic concept features from a query image. Third, multimodal business venue recognition: we extend visually detected concepts to multimodal feature representations that allow a test image to be associated with business reviews and images from social media for business venue recognition. The experiments results show the visual concepts detected by BA-CNN can achieve up to 22.5% relative improvement for business venue recognition compared to the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network features. Experiments also show that by leveraging multimodal information from social media we can further boost the performance, especially when the database images belonging to each business venue are scarce",

    "abstract": "Social networks contain a wealth of useful information. In this paper, we study a challenging task for integrating users' information from multiple heterogeneous social networks to gain a comprehensive understanding of users' interests and behaviors. Although much effort has been dedicated to study this problem, most existing approaches adopt linear or shallow models to fuse information from multiple sources.  Such approaches cannot properly capture the complex nature of and relationships among different social networks. Adopting deep learning approaches to learning a joint representation can better capture the complexity, but this neglects measuring the level of confidence in each source and the consistency among different sources. In this paper, we present a framework for multiple social network learning, whose core is a novel model that fuses social networks using deep learning with source confidence and consistency regularization. To evaluate the model, we apply it to predict individuals' tendency to volunteerism. With extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall and F1-score",

    "abstract": "Successive point-of-interest (POI) recommendation in location-based social networks (LBSNs) becomes a significant task since it helps users to navigate a number of candidate POIs and provides the best POI recommendations based on users’ most recent check-in knowledge. However, all existing methods for successive POI recommendation only focus on modeling the correlation between POIs based on users’ check-in sequences, but ignore an important fact that successive POI recommendation is a time-subtle recommendation task. In fact, even with the same previous check-in information, users would prefer different successive POIs at different time. To capture the impact of time on successive POI recommendation, in this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal latent ranking (STELLAR) method to explicitly model the interactions among user, POI, and time. In particular, the proposed STELLAR model is built upon a ranking-based pairwise tensor factorization framework with a fine-grained modeling of user-POI, POI-time, and POI-POI interactions for successive POI recommendation. Moreover, we propose a new interval-aware weight utility function to differentiate successive check-ins’ correlations, which breaks the time interval constraint in prior work. Evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the STELLAR model outperforms state-of-the-art successive POI recommendation model about 20% in Precision@5 and Recall@5",

Several papers have been published on the problem of visual emotion analysis. In particular, attempts have been made to analyze and predict people's emotional reaction towards images. To this end, different kinds of hand-tuned features are proposed. The results reported on several carefully selected and labeled small image data sets have confirmed the promise of such features. While the recent successes of many computer vision related tasks are due to the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), visual emotion analysis has not achieved the same level of success. This may be primarily due to the unavailability of confidently labeled and relatively large image data sets for visual emotion analysis. In this work, we introduce a new data set, which started from 3+ million weakly labeled images of different emotions and ended up 30 times as large as the current largest publicly available visual emotion data set. We hope that this data set encourages further research on visual emotion analysis.

Millions of people use social media to communicate and mobilize their viewpoints on protests. Hence, it is a valuable tool for organizing social movements.

In this paper, we are inspired by sociological theories of protest participation and propose a framework to predict from the user's past status messages and interactions whether the next post of the user will be a declaration of protest. Drawing concepts from these theories, we model the interplay between the user's status messages and messages interacting with him over time and predict whether the next post of the user will be a declaration of protest. We evaluate the framework using data from the social media platform Twitter on protests during the recent Nigerian elections and demonstrate that it can effectively predict whether the next post of a user is a declaration of protest",

A state-of-the-art method for such implicit feedback, or one-class collaborative filtering (OC-CF), problems is SLIM, which makes recommendations based on a learned item-item similarity matrix. While SLIM has been shown to perform well on implicit feedback tasks, we argue that it is hindered by two limitations: first, it does not produce user-personalised predictions, which hampers recommendation performance; second, it involves solving a constrained optimisation problem, which impedes fast training. In this paper, we propose LRec, a variant of SLIM that overcomes these limitations without sacrificing any of SLIM's strengths.At its core, LRec employs linear logistic regression; despite this simplicity, LRec consistently and significantly outperforms all existing methods on a range of datasets.

Prior work on knowledge base construction has compiled part-whole assertions, but with substantial limitations: i) semantically different kinds of part-whole relations are conflated into a single generic relation, ii) the arguments of a part-whole assertion are merely words with ambiguous meaning, iii) the assertions lack additional attributes like visibility (e.g., a nose is visible but a kidney is not) and cardinality information (e.g., a bird has two legs while a spider eight), iv) limited coverage of only tens of thousands of assertions. This paper presents a new method for automatically acquiring part-whole commonsense from Web contents and image tags at an unprecedented scale, yielding many millions of assertions, while specifically addressing the four shortcomings of prior work. Our method combines pattern-based information extraction methods with logical reasoning. We carefully distinguish different relations: physicalPartOf, memberOf, substanceOf. We consistently map the arguments of all assertions onto WordNet senses, eliminating the ambiguity of word-level assertions. We identify whether the parts can be visually perceived, and infer cardinalities for the assertions.

This is a tedious process and the Web search engines address only part of the overall problem, viz., producing only a list of relevant sources. In this paper, we present ClaimEval, a novel and integrated approach which given a set of claims to validate, extracts a set of pro and con arguments from the Web information sources, and jointly estimates credibility of sources and correctness of claims. ClaimEval uses Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL), resulting in a flexible and principled framework which makes it easy to state and incorporate different forms of prior-knowledge.

In this paper, we consider the case where there is a confounding variable Z that influences both the text features X and the class variable Y. For example, a classifier trained to predict the health status of a user based on their online communications may be confounded by socioeconomic variables. When the influence of Z changes from training to testing data, we find that classifier accuracy can degrade rapidly. Our approach, based on Pearl's back-door adjustment, estimates the underlying effect of a text variable on the class variable while controlling for the confounding variable. Although our goal is prediction, not causal inference, we find that such adjustments are essential to building text classifiers that are robust to confounding variables. On three diverse text classifications tasks, we find that covariate adjustment results in higher accuracy than competing baselines over a range of confounding relationships (e.g., in one setting, accuracy improves from 60% to 81%)",

That is, given a prior on utility functions and some observed choices, we invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility functions. However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false beliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally inconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by constructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false beliefs and time inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models make about preferences, beliefs, and biases. We present a behavioral experiment in which human subjects perform preference inference given the same observations of choices as our model. Results show that human subjects (like our model) explain choices in terms of systematic deviations from optimal behavior and suggest that they take such deviations into account when inferring preferences",

    "title": "Learning Deep Representation from Big and Heterogeneous Data for Traffic Accident Inference",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of urbanization and public transportation system, the number of traffic accidents have significantly increased globally over the past decades and become a big problem for human society. Facing these possible and unexpected traffic accidents, understanding what causes traffic accident and early alarms for some possible ones will play a critical role on planning effective traffic management. However, due to the lack of supported sensing data, research is very limited on the field of updating traffic accident risk in real-time. Therefore, in this paper, we collect big and heterogeneous data (7 months traffic accident data and 1.6 million users' GPS records) to understand how human mobility will affect traffic accident risk. By mining these data, we develop a deep model of Stack denoise Autoencoder to learn hierarchical feature representation of human mobility. And these features are used for efficient prediction of traffic accident risk level. Once the model has been trained, our model can simulate corresponding traffic accident risk map with given real-time input of human mobility. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of our model and suggest that traffic accident risk can be significantly more predictable through human mobility",

We extensively experiment with our algorithm in a large-scale, detailed electricity retail markets simulation of the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC) and: 1) find that our algorithm results in 15% peak-demand reduction, 2) find that its peak-flattening results in greater profit and/or profit-share for the broker and allows it to win against the 1st and 2nd place brokers from the Power TAC 2014 finals, and 3) analyze several economic implications of using TOU tariffs in competitive retail markets",

    "abstract": "Poker is a family of card games that includes many varia- tions. We hypothesize that most poker games can be solved as a pattern matching problem, and propose creating a strong poker playing system based on a unified poker representa- tion. Our poker player learns through iterative self-play, and improves its understanding of the game by training on the results of its previous actions without sophisticated domain knowledge. We evaluate our system on three poker games: single player video poker, two-player Limit Texas Hold’em, and finally two-player 2-7 triple draw poker. We show that our model can quickly learn patterns in these very different poker games while it improves from zero knowledge to a competi- tive player against human experts.  The contributions of this paper include: (1) a novel represen- tation for poker games, extendable to different poker vari- ations, (2) a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based learning model that can effectively learn the patterns in three different games, and (3) a self-trained system that signif- icantly beats the heuristic-based program on which it is trained, and our system is competitive against human expert players",

Networks trained for a new domain can improve their performance by routing activation selectively through previously learned neural structure, regardless of how or for what it was learned. A neuroevolution implementation of this approach is presented with application to high-dimensional sequential decision-making domains. This approach is more general than previous approaches to neural transfer for reinforcement learning. It is domain-agnostic and requires no prior assumptions about the nature of task relatedness or mappings. The method is analyzed in a stochastic version of the Arcade Learning Environment, demonstrating that it improves performance in some of the more complex Atari 2600 games, and that the success of transfer can be predicted based on a high-level characterization of game dynamics",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, water markets have been successfully fielded in countries such as Australia, the United states, Chile, China, etc. Water users, mainly irrigators, have benefited immensely from water markets. However, the current water market design also faces certain serious barriers. It has been pointed out that transaction costs, which exists in most markets, induce great welfare loss. For example, for water markets in western China discussed in this paper, the influence of transaction costs is significant. Another important barrier is the locality of trades due to geographical constraints. Based on the water market at Xiying Irrigation, one of the most successful water market in western China, we model the water market as a graph with minimum transaction thresholds on edges. Our goal is to maximize the transaction volume or welfare. We prove that the existence of transaction costs results in no polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) to maximize social welfare (MAX SNP-hard). The complexities on special graphs are also presented. From a practical point of view, however, optimal social welfare can be obtained via a well-designed mixed integer linear program and can be approximated near optimally at a large scale via a heuristic algorithm. Both algorithms are tested on data sets generated from real historical trading data. Our study also suggests the importance of reducing transaction costs, for example, institutional costs in water market design. Our work opens a potentially important avenue of market design within the agenda of computational sustainability",

    "abstract": "Spear-phishing attacks pose a serious threat to sensitive computer systems, since they sidestep technical security mechanisms by exploiting the carelessness of authorized users. A common way to mitigate such attacks is to use e-mail filters which block e-mails with a maliciousness score above a chosen threshold. Optimal choice of such a threshold involves a tradeoff between the risk from delivered malicious emails and the cost of blocking benign traffic. A further complicating factor is the strategic nature of an attacker, who may selectively target users offering the best value in terms of likelihood of success and resulting access privileges. Previous work on strategic threshold-selection considered a single organization choosing thresholds for all users. In reality, many organizations are potential targets of such attacks, and their incentives need not be well aligned. We therefore consider the problem of strategic threshold-selection by a collection of independent self-interested users. We characterize both Stackelberg multi-defender equilibria, corresponding to short-term strategic dynamics, as well as Nash equilibria of the simultaneous game between all users and the attacker, modeling long-term dynamics, and exhibit a polynomial-time algorithm for computing short-term (Stackelberg) equilibria. We find that while Stackelberg multi-defender equilibrium need not exist, Nash equilibrium always exists, and remarkably, both equilibria are unique and socially optimal",

In this paper, we focus on dynamics for the sequence form of extensive-form games, providing three dynamics: one realization equivalent to the normal-form logit dynamic, one realization equivalent to the agent-form replicator dynamic, and one realization equivalent to the agent-form logit dynamic. All the considered dynamics require polynomial time and space, providing an exponential compression w.r.t. the dynamics currently known and providing thus tools that can be effectively employed in practice. Moreover, we use our tools to compare the agent-form and normal-form dynamics and to provide new \"hybrid\" dynamics",

Today the bid price per ad impression is typically decided by the expected value of how it can lead to a desired action event to the advertiser. However, this industry standard approach to decide the bid price does not consider the actual effect of the ad shown to the user, which should be measured based on the performance lift among users who have been or have not been exposed to a certain treatment of ads. In this paper, we propose a new bidding strategy and prove that if the bid price is decided based on the performance lift rather than absolute performance value, advertisers can actually gain more action events. We describe the modeling methodology to predict the performance lift and demonstrate the actual performance gain through blind A/B test with real ad campaigns.

In light of these results, we investigate whether it is possible to reimpose NP-hardness shields for such electorates by allowing the voters to specify partial preferences instead of insisting they cast complete ballots. In particular, we show that in single-peaked and nearly single-peaked electorates, if voters are allowed to submit top-truncated ballots, then the complexity of manipulation and bribery for many voting rules increases from being in P to being NP-complete",

For example, assume a company is going to release two models of its product line and performs a questionnaire survey in an online forum to determine their detailed specs. Typically, a customer will buy only one model, but she can answer multiple times by logging onto the forum under several email accounts. We first characterize possible outcomes of mechanisms that satisfy false-name-proofness, as well as some mild conditions. By extending the result, we completely characterize the class of false-name-proof mechanisms when locating two facilities on a circle.

    "abstract": "Highly targeted spear phishing attacks are increasingly common, and have been implicated in many major security breeches.  Email filtering systems are the first line of defense against such attacks.  These filters are typically configured with uniform thresholds for deciding whether or not to allow a message to be delivered to a user.  However, users have very significant differences in both their susceptibility to phishing attacks as well as their access to critical information and credentials that can cause damage. Recent work has considered setting personalized thresholds for individual users based on a Stackelberg game model.  We consider two important extensions of the previous model. First, in our model user values can be substitutable, modeling cases where multiple users provide access to the same information or credential. Second, we consider attackers who make sequential attack plans based on the outcome of previous attacks. Our analysis starts from scenarios where there is only one credential and then extends to more general scenarios with multiple credentials. For single-credential scenarios, we demonstrate that the optimal defense strategy can be found by solving a binary combinatorial optimization problem called PEDS. For multiple-credential scenarios, we formulate it as a bilevel optimization problem for finding the optimal defense strategy and then reduce it to a single level optimization problem called PEMS using complementary slackness conditions. Experimental results show that both PEDS and PEMS lead to significant higher defender utilities than two existing benchmarks in different parameter settings. Also, both PEDS and PEMS are more robust than the existing benchmarks considering uncertainties",

Our model is motivated by the fact that in many settings, agents cannot express the numerical values of their utility for different outcomes, but are still able to rank the outcomes in their order of preference. Specifically, we study problems where the ground truth exists in the form of a weighted graph, and look to design algorithms that approximate the true optimum matching using only the preference orderings for each agent (induced by the hidden weights) as input. If no restrictions are placed on the weights, then one cannot hope to do better than the simple greedy algorithm, which yields a half optimal matching. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that by imposing a little structure on the weights, we can improve upon the trivial algorithm significantly: we design a 1.6-approximation algorithm for instances where the hidden weights obey the metric inequality. Our algorithm is obtained using a simple but powerful framework that allows us to combine greedy and random techniques in unconventional ways. These results are the first non-trivial ordinal approximation algorithms for such problems, and indicate that we can design robust matchings even when we are agnostic to the precise agent utilities",

An appealing idea is to use the simplified abstraction to play the early parts of the game and then, once the subgame becomes tractable, to calculate a solution using a finer-grained abstraction in real time, creating a combined final strategy. While this approach is straightforward for perfect information games, it is a much more complex problem for imperfect information games. If the subgame is solved locally, the opponent can alter his play in prior to this subgame to exploit our combined strategy. To prevent this, we introduce the notion of subgame margin, a simple value with appealing properties. If any best response reaches the subgame, the improvement of exploitability of the combined strategy is (at least) proportional to the subgame margin. This motivates subgame refinements resulting in large positive margins. Unfortunately, current techniques either neglect subgame margin (potentially leading to a large negative subgame margin and drastically more exploitable strategies), or guarantee only non-negative subgame margin (possibly producing the original, unrefined strategy, even if much stronger strategies are possible). Our technique remedies this problem by maximizing the subgame margin and is guaranteed to find the optimal solution. We evaluate our technique using one of the top participants of the AAAI-14 Computer Poker Competition, the leading playground for agents in imperfect information setting",

    "title": "Closeness Centrality for Networks with Overlapping Community Structure",
    "abstract": "Certain real-life networks have a community structure in which communities overlap. For example, a typical bus network includes bus stops (nodes), which belong to one or more bus lines (communities) that often overlap. Clearly, it is important to take this information into account when measuring the centrality of a bus stop - how important it is to the functioning of the network. For example, if a certain stop becomes inaccessible, the impact will depend in part on the bus lines that visit it. However, existing centrality measures do not take such information into account. Our aim is to bridge this gap. We begin by developing a new game-theoretic solution concept, which we call the Configuration semivalue, in order to have greater flexibility in modelling the community structure compared to previous solution concepts from cooperative game theory. We then use the new concept as a building block to construct the first extension of Closeness centrality to networks with community structure (overlapping or otherwise). Despite the computational complexity inherited from the Configuration semivalue, we show that the corresponding extension of Closeness centrality can be computed in polynomial time. We empirically evaluate this measure and our algorithm that computes it by analysing the Warsaw public transportation network",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing Nash equilibria of zero-sum games.Many natural zero-sum games have exponentially many strategies, but highly structured payoffs.  For example, in the well-studied Colonel Blotto game (introduced by Borel in 1921), players must divide a pool of troops among a set of battlefields with the goal of winning (i.e., having more troops in) a majority.  The Colonel Blotto game is commonly used for analyzing a wide range of applications from the U.S presidential election, to innovative technology competitions, toadvertisement, to sports.However, because of the size of the strategy space, standard  methods for computing equilibria of zero-sum games fail to be computationally feasible.Indeed, despite its importance, only few solutions for special variants of the problem are known.  In this paper we show how to compute equilibria of Colonel Blotto games. Moreover, our approach takes the form of a general reduction: to find a Nash equilibrium of a zero-sum game, it suffices to design a separation oracle for the strategy polytope of any bilinear game that is payoff-equivalent.  We then apply this technique to obtain the first polytime algorithms for a variety of games.  In addition to Colonel Blotto, we also show how to compute equilibria in an infinite-strategy variant called the General Lotto game; this involves showing how to prune the strategy space to a finite subset before applying our reduction.  We also consider the class of dueling games, first introduced by Immorlica et al. (2011).  We show that our approach provably extends the class of dueling games for which equilibria can be computed: we introduce a new dueling game, the matching duel, on which prior methods fail to be computationally feasible but upon which our reduction can be applied",

A natural and well-studied question is the tournament fixing problem (TFP): given the set of all pairwise match outcomes, can a tournament organizer rig an SE tournament by adjusting the initial seeding so that their favorite player wins? We prove new sufficient conditions on the pairwise match outcome information and the favorite player, under which there is guaranteed to be a seeding where the player wins the tournament. Our results greatly generalize previous results. We also investigate the relationship between the set of players that can win an SE tournament under some seeding (so called SE winners) and other traditional tournament solutions. In addition, we generalize and strengthen prior work on probabilistic models for generating tournaments. For instance, we show that every player in an n player tournament generated by the Condorcet Random Model will be an SE winner even when the noise is as small as possible, p = Θ(ln n/n); prior work only had such results for p ≥ Ω( ln n/n).

The dominance semantics of mCP-nets is based on the concept of voting, and different voting schemes give rise to different dominance semantics for the group. Unlike CP-nets, which received an extensive complexity analysis, mCP-nets, as reported multiple times in the literature, lack a precise study of the voting tasks' complexity. Prior to this work, only a complexity analysis of brute-force algorithms for these tasks was available, and this analysis only gave EXPTIME upper bounds for most of those problems. In this paper, we start to fill this gap by carrying out a precise computational complexity analysis of voting tasks on acyclic binary polynomially connected mCP-nets whose constituents are standard CP-nets. Interestingly, all these problems actually belong to various levels of the polynomial hierarchy, and some of them even belong to PTIME or LOGSPACE. Furthermore, for most of these problems, we provide completeness results, which show tight lower bounds for problems that (up to date) did not have any explicit non-obvious lower bound",

    "abstract": "In a landmark paper in the mechanism design literature, Cremer and McLean (1985) (CM for short) show that when a bidder’s valuation is correlated with an external signal, a monopolistic seller is able to extract the full social surplus as revenue. In the original paper and subsequent literature, the focus has been on ex-post incentive compatible (or IC) mechanisms, where truth telling is an ex-post Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we explore the implications of Bayesian versus ex-post IC in a correlated valuation setting. We generalize the full extraction result to settings that do not satisfy the assumptions of CM. In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for full extraction that strictly relax the original conditions given in CM. These more general conditions characterize the situations under which requiring ex-post IC leads to a decrease in expected revenue relative to Bayesian IC. We also demonstrate that the expected revenue from the optimal ex-post IC mechanism guarantees at most a (|Θ| + 1)/4 approximation to that of a Bayesian IC mechanism, where |Θ| is the number of bidder types. Finally, using techniques from automated mechanism design, we show that, for randomly generated distributions, the average expected revenue achieved by Bayesian IC mechanisms is significantly larger than that for ex-post IC mechanisms",

Specifically, we show that each protocol in the class of generalized cut and choose (GCC) protocols --- which includes the most important discrete cake cutting protocols --- is guaranteed to have approximate subgame perfect Nash equilibria, or even exact equilibria if the protocol's tie-breaking rule is flexible. We further observe that the (approximate) equilibria of proportional protocols --- which guarantee each of the n agents a 1/n-fraction of the cake --- must be (approximately) proportional, thereby answering the above question in the positive (at least for one common notion of fairness)",

Equivalently, we show that truthfully reporting is a 0.5-approximate Nash equilibrium in this game. To identify sufficient conditions for truthfully reporting being close to Nash equilibrium, we conduct a parameterized study on strategic behaviors and further show that the ratio of utility gain decreases linearly as buyer's initial endowment increases or his maximum share of an item decreases. Finally, we consider collusive behavior of a coalition and prove that the utility gain is bounded by 1/(1 - maximum share of the collusion). Our findings justify the truthful reporting assumption in Fisher markets by a quantitative study on participants incentive, and imply that under large market assumption, the utility gain of a buyer from manipulations diminishes to 0",

We introduce the notion of a graphical hedonic game and show that, in contrast, on classes of graphical hedonic games whose underlying graphs are of bounded treewidth and degree, such problems become easy. In particular, problems that can be specified through quantification over agents, coalitions, and (connected) partitions can be decided in linear time. The proof is by reduction to monadic second order logic. We also provide faster algorithms in special cases, and show that the extra condition of the degree bound cannot be dropped.

These exchanges are conducted via cycles---where each incompatible patient-donor pair in the cycle both gives and receives a kidney---and chains, which are started by an altruist donor who does not need a kidney in return. Finding the best combination of cycles and chains is hard. The leading algorithms for this optimization problem use either branch and price — a combination of branch and bound and column generation — or constraint generation. We show a correctness error in the leading prior branch-and-price-based approach [Glorie et al. 2014]. We develop a provably correct fix to it, which also necessarily changes the algorithm's complexity, as well as other improvements to the search algorithm. Next, we compare our solver to the leading constraint-generation-based solver and to the best prior correct branch-and-price-based solver. We focus on the setting where chains have a length cap. A cap is desirable in practice since if even one edge in the chain fails, the rest of the chain fails: the cap precludes very long chains that are extremely unlikely to execute and instead causes the solution to have more parallel chains and cycles that are more likely to succeed. We work with the UNOS nationwide kidney exchange, which uses a chain cap. Algorithms from our group autonomously make the transplant plans for that exchange.

We introduce the family of distance-based rules and show that these can be justified as maximum likelihood estimators of the  truth. Within this family, we single out the logarithmic distance-based rule as especially appealing based on a social-choice-theoretic  axiomatization. We give an efficient algorithm for executing this rule  as well as an approximate hill climbing algorithm, and evaluate these experimentally",

    "title": "Strategy-Based Warm Starting for Regret Minimization in Games",
    "abstract": "Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) is a popular iterative algorithm for approximating Nash equilibria in imperfect-information multi-step two-player zero-sum games. We introduce the first general, principled method for warm starting CFR. Our approach requires only a strategy for each player, and accomplishes the warm start at the cost of a single traversal of the game tree. The method provably warm starts CFR to as many iterations as it would have taken to reach a strategy profile of the same quality as the input strategies, and does not alter the convergence bounds of the algorithms. Unlike prior approaches to warm starting, ours can be applied in all cases. Our method is agnostic to the origins of the input strategies. For example, they can be based on human domain knowledge, the observed strategy of a strong agent, the solution of a coarser abstraction, or the output of some algorithm that converges rapidly at first but slowly as it gets closer to an equilibrium. Experiments demonstrate that one can improve overall convergence in a game by first running CFR on a smaller, coarser abstraction of the game and then using the strategy in the abstract game to warm start CFR in the full game",

    "abstract": "We introduce a state space search method that identifies dead-end states, analyzes the reasons for failure, and learns to avoid similar mistakes in the future. Our work is placed in classical planning. The key technique are critical-path heuristics hC, relative to a set C of conjunctions. These recognize a dead-end state s, returning hC(s) = infty, if s has no solution even when allowing to break up conjunctive subgoals into the elements of C. Our key idea is to learn C during search. Starting from a simple initial C, we augment search to identify unrecognized dead-ends s, where hC(s) < infinity. We design methods analyzing the situation at such s, adding new conjunctions into C to obtain hC(s) = infty, thus learning to recognize s as well as similar dead-ends search may encounter in the future. We furthermore learn clauses phi where s' not satisfying phi implies hC(s') = infty, to avoid the prohibitive overhead of computing hC on every search state. Arranging these techniques in a depth-first search, we obtain an algorithm approaching the elegance of clause learning in SAT, learning to refute search subtrees. Our experiments show that this can be quite powerful. On problems where dead-ends abound, the learning reliably reduces the search space by several orders of magnitude",

Malicious rumors could cause chaos in society and hence need to be blocked as soon as possible after being detected. In this paper, we propose a model of dynamic rumor influence minimization with user experience (DRIMUX). Our goal is to minimize the influence of the rumor (i.e., the number of users that have accepted and sent the rumor) by blocking a certain subset of nodes. A dynamic Ising propagation model considering both the global popularity and individual attraction of the rumor is presented based on realistic scenario. In addition, different from existing problems of influence minimization, we take into account the constraint of user experience utility. Specifically, each node is assigned a tolerance time threshold. If the blocking time of each user exceeds that threshold, the utility of the network will decrease. Under this constraint, we then formulate the problem as a network inference problem with survival theory, and propose solutions based on maximum likelihood principle. Experiments are implemented based on large-scale real world networks and validate the effectiveness of our method",

To address these issues, we propose a machine learning (ML) framework for variable branching in MIP.Our method observes the decisions made by Strong Branching (SB), a time-consuming strategy that produces small search trees, collecting features that characterize the candidate branching variables at each node of the tree. Based on the collected data, we learn an easy-to-evaluate surrogate function that mimics the SB strategy, by means of solving a learning-to-rank problem, common in ML. The learned ranking function is then used for branching. The learning is instance-specific, and is performed on-the-fly while executing a branch-and-bound search to solve the MIP instance.

In this paper, we provide a theoretical justification for this increased robustness by formally analyzing how these algorithms behave on infinite graphs.

Classic approaches exploit the algebraic structure of the underlying matrix, while more recent approaches use randomization. An entirely different approach that uses the A* heuristic search algorithm to find an optimal solution was recently proposed. Not surprisingly it is limited to effectively selecting only a small number of features. We propose a similar approach related to the Weighted A* algorithm. This gives algorithms that are not guaranteed to find an optimal solution but run much faster than the A* approach, enabling effective selection of many features from large datasets. We demonstrate experimentally that these new algorithms are more accurate than the current state-of-the-art while still being practical.

    "title": "Personalized Alert Agent for Optimal User Performance",
    "abstract": "Preventive maintenance is essential for the smooth operation of any equipment. Still, people occasionally do not maintain their equipment adequately. Maintenance alert systems attempt to remind people to perform maintenance. However, most of these systems do not provide alerts at the optimal timing, and nor do they take into account the time required for maintenance or compute the optimal timing for a specific user. We model the problem of maintenance performance, assuming maintenance is time consuming. We solve the optimal policy for the user, i.e., the optimal timing for a user to perform maintenance. This optimal strategy depends on the value of user's time, and thus it may vary from user to user and may change over time. %We present a game Based on the solved optimal strategy we present a personalized maintenance agent, which, depending on the value of user's time, provides alerts to the user when she should perform maintenance. In an experiment using a spaceship computer game, we show that receiving alerts from the personalized alert agent significantly improves user performance",

    "abstract": "This paper studies two suboptimal advice provisioning methods (\"advisors\") as an alternative to providing optimal advice in repeated advising settings. Providing users with suboptimal advice has been reported to be highly advantageous whenever the optimal advice is non-intuitive, hence might not be accepted by the user. Alas, prior methods that rely on suboptimal advice generation were designed primarily for a single-shot advice provisioning setting, hence their performance in repeated settings is questionable. Our methods, on the other hand, are tailored to the repeated interaction case. Comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods, involving hundreds of human participants, reveals that both methods meet their primary design goal (either an increased user profit or an increased user satisfaction from the advisor), while performing at least as good with the alternative goal, compared to having people perform with: (a) no advisor at all; (b) an advisor providing the theoretic-optimal advice; and (c) an effective suboptimal-advice-based advisor designed for the non-repeated variant of our experimental framework",

Second, human choice is often made after examining complex items such as images.  The recently proposed choice model based on the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM choice model) has been proved to represent three typical phenomena of human choice, which addresses the first complexity.  We extend the RBM choice model to a deep choice model (DCM) to deal with the features of items, which are ignored in the RBM choice model.  We then use deep learning to extract latent features from images and plug those latent features as input to the DCM.

In NNMs, user representations are expressive because each user's preference can be regarded as normalized mixture of preferences of stereotypical users.

In this paper we present a framework of handling inconsistent existential rules under stable model semantics, which is defined by a notion called rule repairs to select maximal components of the existential rules. Surprisingly, for R-acyclic existential rules with R-stratified or guarded existential rules with stratified negations, both the data complexity and combined complexity of query answering under the rule repair semantics remain the same as that under the conventional query answering semantics. This leads us to propose several approaches to handle the rule repair semantics by calling answer set programming solvers. An experimental evaluation shows that these approaches have good scalability of query answering under rule repairs on realistic cases",

In contrast we make two main contributions: an algorithm for explanation that calculates the strength of token causes, and an evaluation based on simulated data that enables objective comparison against prior methods and ground truth.

However, the optimal loss function is determined during experiments whose parameters are examined among a closed set of candidates. Moreover, embeddings over two knowledge graphs with different entities and relations share the same set of candidate loss functions, ignoring the locality of both graphs. This leads to the limited performance of embedding related applications. In this paper, we propose a locally adaptive translation method for knowledge graph embedding, called TransA, to find the optimal loss function by adaptively determining its margin over different knowledge graphs.

TFPGs are often produced manually, from a given dynamic system of greater complexity, as abstract representations of the system behavior under specific faulty conditions. In this paper we tackle two key difficulties in this process: first, how to make sure that no important behavior of the system is overlooked in the TFPG, and that no spurious, non-existent behavior is introduced; second, how to devise the correct values for the delays between events. We propose a model checking approach to automatically validate the completeness and tightness of a TFPG for a given infinite-state dynamic system, and a procedure for the automated synthesis of the delay parameters.

In many situations there is a need to reason about intertemporal qualitative spatial relations, i.e. qualitative relations between spatial regions at different time-points. However, these relations can never be explicitly observed since they are between regions at different time-points. In applications where the qualitative spatial relations are partly acquired by for example a robotic system it is therefore necessary to infer these relations. This problem has, to the best of our knowledge, not been explicitly studied before. The contribution presented in this paper is two-fold. First, we present a spatio-temporal logic MSTL, which allows for spatio-temporal stream reasoning. Second, we define the concept of a landmark as a region that does not change between time-points and use these landmarks to infer qualitative spatio-temporal relations between non-landmark regions at different time-points.

We propose here a weakening of independence, named agenda separability: a judgment aggregation rule satisfies it if, whenever the agenda is composed of several independent sub-agendas, the resulting collective judgment sets can be computed separately for each sub-agenda and then put together. We show that this property is discriminant, in the sense that among judgment aggregation rules so far studied in the literature, some satisfy it and some do not.

Such approaches enable us to capture a natural notion of \"plausibility\" in a domain while avoiding the extremely difficult problem of specifying an explicit representation of what is \"plausible.\" We specifically consider the question of which syntactic classes of formulas have efficient algorithms for abduction. We find that the class of k-DNF explanations can be found in polynomial time for any fixed k; but, we also find evidence that even weak versions of our abduction task are intractable for the usual class of conjunctions. This evidence is provided by a connection to the usual, inductive PAC-learning model proposed by Valiant. We also consider an exception-tolerant variant of abduction. We observe that it is possible for polynomial-time algorithms to tolerate a few adversarially chosen exceptions, again for the class of k-DNF explanations.

    "abstract": "Ontology-based data access (OBDA) is a novel paradigm facilitating access to relational data, realized by linking data sources to an ontology by means of declarative mappings. DL-Lite_R, which is the logic underpinning the W3C ontology language OWL 2 QL and the current language of choice for OBDA, has been designed with the goal of delegating query answering to the underlying database engine, and thus is restricted in expressive power. E.g., it does not allow one to express disjunctive information, and any form of recursion on the data. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations of DL-Lite_R, and extend OBDA to more expressive ontology languages, while still leveraging the underlying relational technology for query answering. We achieve this by relying on two well-known mechanisms, namely conservative rewriting and approximation, but significantly extend their practical impact by bringing into the picture the mapping, an essential component of OBDA. Specifically, we develop techniques to rewrite OBDA specifications with an expressive ontology to \"equivalent\" ones with a DL-Lite_R ontology, if possible, and to approximate them otherwise. We do so by exploiting the high expressive power of the mapping layer to capture part of the domain semantics of rich ontology languages. We have implemented our techniques in the prototype system OntoProx, making use of the state-of-the-art OBDA system Ontop and the query answering system Clipper, and we have shown their feasibility and effectiveness with experiments on synthetic and real-world data",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Linked Data has been driven by the increasing demand for information exchange between organisations, as well as by data publishing regulations in domains such as health care and governance. In this setting, sensitive information is at risk of disclosure since published data can be linked with arbitrary external data sources. In this paper we lay the foundations of privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) in the context of Linked Data. We consider anonymisations of RDF graphs (and, more generally, relational datasets with labelled nulls) and define notions of safe and optimal anonymisations. Safety ensures that the anonymised data can be published with provable protection guarantees against linking attacks, whereas optimality ensures that it preserves as much information from the original data as possible, while satisfying the safety requirement. We establish the complexity of the underpinning decision problems both under open-world semantics inherent to RDF and a closed-world semantics, where we assume that an attacker has complete knowledge over some part of the original data",

We prove that SDDs are more succinct than OBDDs also in theory, by constructing a family of boolean functions where each member has polynomial SDD size but exponential OBDD size.

In this work, we propose a new general first-order account of probability and only knowing that admits knowledge bases with  incomplete and probabilistic specifications.

    "abstract": "The Golog action programming language is a powerful means to express high-level behaviours in terms of programs over actions defined in a Situation Calculus theory. In particular for physical systems, verifying that the program satisfies certain desired temporal properties is often crucial, but undecidable in general, the latter being due to the language's high expressiveness in terms of first-order quantification, range of action effects, and program constructs. So far, approaches to achieve decidability involved restrictions where action effects either had to be context-free (i.e. not depend on the current state), local (i.e. only affect objects mentioned in the action's parameters), or at least bounded (i.e. only affect a finite number of objects). In this paper, we introduce two new, more general classes of action theories that allow for context-sensitive, non-local, unbounded effects, i.e. actions that may affect an unbounded number of possibly unnamed objects in a state-dependent fashion. We contribute to the further exploration of the boundary between decidability and undecidability for Golog, showing that for our new classes of action theories in the two-variable fragment of first-order logic, verification of CTL* properties of programs over ground actions is decidable",

PEKBs have certain syntactic restrictions that lead to desirable computational properties; primarily, a PEKB is a conjunction of modal literals, and therefore contains no disjunction. Sound entailment can be checked in polynomial time, and is complete for a large set of arbitrary formulae in logics Kn and KDn. In this paper, we extend PEKBs to deal with a restricted form of disjunction: 'knowing whether.' An agent i knows whether Q iff agent i knows Q or knows not Q; that is, []Q or []not(Q). In our experience, the ability to represent that an agent knows whether something holds is useful in many multi-agent domains. We represent knowing whether with a modal operator, and present sound polynomial-time entailment algorithms on PEKBs with the knowing whether operator in Kn and KDn, but which are complete for a smaller class of queries than standard PEKBs",

We call our proposed language P[R] and our solver SAT-to-SAT because it facilitates communication between several SAT solvers. Using our proposal, non-specialists can specify new reasoning methods (propagators) in a declarative fashion and obtain a solver that benefits from both state-of-the-art techniques implemented in SAT solvers as well as problem-specific reasoning methods that depend on the problem's structure.

Recently, Atserias and Oliva (2014) showed that, unlike for SAT, many of the well-known decompositional parameters (such as treewidth and pathwidth) do not allow efficient algorithms for QBF. The main reason for this seems to be the lack of awareness of these parameters towards the dependencies between variables of a QBF formula. In this paper we extend the ordinary pathwidth to the QBF-setting by introducing prefix pathwidth, which takes into account the dependencies between variables in a QBF, and show that it leads to an efficient algorithm for QBF. We hope that our approach will help to initiate the study of novel tailor-made decompositional parameters for QBF and thereby help to lift the success of these decompositional parameters from SAT to QBF",

In this paper we introduce an SDD variant, called the Zero-suppressed Sentential Decision Diagram (ZSDD). The key idea of ZSDD is to employ new trimming rules for obtaining a canonical form. As a result, ZSDD subsumes the Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagram (ZDD) as a strict subset. ZDDs are known for their effectiveness on representing sparse Boolean functions. Likewise, ZSDDs can be more succinct than SDDs when representing sparse Boolean functions. We propose several polytime bottom-up operations over ZSDDs, and a technique for reducing ZSDD size, while maintaining applicability to important queries. We also specify two distinct upper bounds on ZSDD sizes; one is derived from the treewidth of a CNF and the other from the size of a family of sets.

We also show that for situation-determined ConGolog programs, we can compile away the program into the action theory itself without loss of generality.

There is some evidence that such limitations have restricted the applicability of AI planning technology in the real world, as is apparent in the case of task and motion planning in robotics.

Traditional methods either employ hand-crafted features to discriminate mitoses from other cells or construct a pixel-wise classifier to label every pixel in a sliding window way. While the former suffers from the large shape variation of mitoses and the existence of many mimics with similar appearance, the slow speed of the later prohibits its use in clinical practice.In order to overcome these shortcomings, we propose a fast and accurate method to detect mitosis by designing a novel deep cascaded convolutional neural network, which is composed of two components. First, by leveraging the fully convolutional neural network, we propose a coarse retrieval model to identify and locate the candidates of mitosis while preserving a high sensitivity.Based on these candidates, a fine discrimination model utilizing knowledge transferred from cross-domain is developed to further single out mitoses from hard mimics.Our approach outperformed other methods by a large margin in 2014 ICPR MITOS-ATYPIA challenge in terms of detection accuracy.

However, the formidable size of EM image data renders human annotation impractical, as it may take decades to fulfill the whole job. An alternative way to reconstruct the connectome can be attained with the computerized scheme that can automatically segment the neuronal structures. The segmentation of EM images is very challenging as the depicted structures can be very diverse.To address this difficult problem, a deep contextual network is proposed here by leveraging multi-level contextual information from the deep hierarchical structure to achieve better segmentation performance.To further improve the robustness against the vanishing gradients and strengthen the capability of the back-propagation of gradient flow, auxiliary classifiers are incorporated in the architecture of our deep neural network. It will be shown that our method can effectively parse the semantic meaning from the images with the underlying neural network and accurately delineate the structural boundaries with the reference of low-level contextual cues. Experimental results on the benchmark dataset of 2012 ISBI segmentation challenge of neuronal structures suggest that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with respect to different evaluation measurements.

In fact, image representation learning and image tagging are two closely related tasks. A proper image representation can achieve better image annotation results, and image tags can be treated as guidance to learn more effective image representation. In this paper, we present an optimal predictive subspace learning method which jointly conducts multi-view representation learning and image tagging. The two tasks can promote each other and the annotation performance can be further improved. To make the subspace to be more compact and discriminative, both visual structure and semantic information are exploited during learning. Moreover, we introduce powerful predictors (SVM) for image tagging to achieve better annotation performance. Experiments on standard image annotation datasets demonstrate the advantages of our method over the existing image annotation methods",

    "title": "Robust Multi-View Subspace Learning through Dual Low-Rank Decompositions",
    "abstract": "Multi-view data is highly common nowadays, since various view-points and different sensors tend to facilitate better data representation. However, data from different views show a large divergence. Specifically, one sample lies in two kinds of structures, one is class structure and the other is view structure, which are intertwined with one another in the original feature space. To address this, we develop a Robust Multi-view Subspace Learning algorithm (RMSL) through dual low-rank decompositions, which desires to seek a low-dimensional view-invariant subspace for multi-view data. Through dual low-rank decompositions, RMSL aims to disassemble two intertwined structures from each other in the low-dimensional subspace. Furthermore, we develop two novel graph regularizers to guide dual low-rank decompositions in a supervised fashion. In this way, the semantic gap across different views would be mitigated so that RMSL can preserve more within-class information and reduce the influence of view variance to seek a more robust low-dimensional subspace. Extensive experiments on two multi-view benchmarks, e.g., face and object images, have witnessed the superiority of our proposed algorithm, by comparing it with the state-of-the-art algorithms",

Here we attempt to go the other direction and autonomously create images that communicate concepts. We present an enhanced semantic model that is used to generate novel images that convey meaning. We employ a vector space model and a large corpus to learn vector representations of words and then train the semantic model to predict word vectors that could describe a given image. Once trained, the model autonomously guides the process of rendering images that convey particular concepts. A significant contribution is that, because of the semantic associations encoded in these word vectors, we can also render images that convey concepts on which the model was not explicitly trained. We evaluate the semantic model with an image clustering technique and demonstrate that the model is successful in creating images that communicate semantic relationships",

It is critical to accelerate the protein crystallization process with improved accuracy for understanding cancer and designing drugs. Systematic high-throughput approaches in protein crystallization have been widely applied, generating a large number of protein crystallization-trial images. Therefore, an efficient and effective automatic analysis for these images is a top priority. In this paper, we present a novel system, CrystalNet, for automatically labeling outcomes of protein crystallization-trial images. CrystalNet is a deep convolutional neural network that automatically extracts features from X-ray protein crystallization images for classification. We show that (1) CrystalNet can provide real-time labels for crystallization images effectively, requiring approximately 2 seconds to provide labels for all 1536 images of crystallization microassay on each plate; (2) compared with the state-of-the-art classification systems in crystallization image analysis, our technique demonstrates an improvement of 8% in accuracy, and achieve 90.8% accuracy in classification. As a part of the high-throughput pipeline which generates millions of images a year, CrystalNet can lead to a substantial reduction of labor-intensive screening",

    "abstract": "This paper adapts topic models to the psychometric testing of MOOC students based on their online forum postings. Measurement theory from education and psychology provides statistical models for quantifying a person's attainment of intangible attributes such as attitudes, abilities or intelligence. Such models infer latent skill levels by relating them to individuals' observed responses on a series of items such as quiz questions. The set of items can be used to measure a latent skill if individuals' responses on them conform to a Guttman scale. Such well-scaled items differentiate between individuals and inferred levels span the entire range from most basic to the advanced. In practice, education researchers manually devise items (quiz questions) while optimising well-scaled conformance. Due to the costly nature and expert requirements of this process, psychometric testing has found limited use in everyday teaching. We aim to develop usable measurement models for highly-instrumented MOOC delivery platforms, by using participation in automatically-extracted online forum topics as items. The challenge is to formalise the Guttman scale educational constraint and incorporate it into topic models. To favour topics that automatically conform to a Guttman scale, we introduce a novel regularisation into non-negative matrix factorisation-based topic modelling. We demonstrate the suitability of our approach with both quantitative experiments on three Coursera MOOCs, and with a qualitative survey of topic interpretability on two MOOCs by domain expert interviews",

Despite this importance, tagging methods often face difficult challenges such as limited training samples and incomplete labels, which usually lead to degenerated performance on tag prediction. To improve the generalization performance, in this paper, we propose Regularized Marginalized Cross-View learning (RMCV) by jointly modeling on attribute noise and label noise. In more details, the proposed model constructs infinite training examples with attribute noises from known exponential-family distributions and exploits label noise via marginalized denoising autoencoder. Therefore, the model benefits from its robustness and alleviates the problem of tag sparsity. While RMCV is a general method for learning tagging, in the evaluations we focus on the specific application of multi-label text tagging. Extensive evaluations on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that RMCV outstands with a superior performance in comparison with state-of-the-art methods",

We formulate this task as a policy transfer learning problem, and propose a first solution, called collective noise contrastive estimation (collective NCE).

The framework introduces a latent variable from the Chinese Restaurant Process to explicitly characterize these unique internal configurations of a particular complex activity as a variable number of tables.It can be analytically shown that the resulting interval network satisfies the transitivity property, and as a result, all local temporal dependencies can be retained and are globally consistent.Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets suggest our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

The second one reduces redundant samples with discrete constraints in a low-rank way. A kernel method based on anchor points is further used to reduce sample variations. The proposed discrete objective function is simplified to a series of sub-problems that admit an analytical solution, resulting in a high-quality discrete solution with a low computational cost.

    "abstract": "Style classification (e.g., architectural, music, fashion) attracts an increasing attention in both research and industrial fields. Most existing works focused on low-level visual features composition for style representation. However, little effort has been devoted to automatic mid-level or high-level style features learning by reorganizing low-level descriptors. Moreover, styles are usually spread out and not easy to differentiate from one to another. In this paper, we call these less representative images as weak style images. To address these issues, we propose a consensus style centralizing auto-encoder (CSCAE) to extract robust style features to facilitate weak style classification. CSCAE is the ensemble of several style centralizing auto-encoders (SCAEs) with consensus constraint. Each SCAE centralizes each feature of certain category in a progressive way. We apply our method in fashion style classification and manga style classification as two example applications. In addition, we collect a new dataset, Online Shopping, for fashion style classification evaluation, which will be publicly available for vision based fashion style research.

However, recent works often focus on recognizing or extracting visual features (e.g., sleeve length, color distribution and clothing pattern) from clothing images accurately. How can we bridge the gap between the visual features and the aesthetic words? In this paper, we formulate this task to a novel three-level framework: visual features(VF) - image-scale space (ISS) - aesthetic words space(AWS). Leveraging the art-field image-scale space served as an intermediate layer, we first propose a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder Guided by CorrelativeLabels (SDAE-GCL) to map the visual features to the image-scale space; and then according to the semantic distances computed byWordNet::Similarity, we map the most often used aesthetic words in online clothing shops to the image-scale space too. Employing upper body menswear images downloaded from several global online clothing shops as experimental data, the results indicate that the proposed three-level framework can help to capture the subtle relationship between visual features and aesthetic words better compared to several baselines. To demonstrate that our three-level framework and its implementation methods are universally applicable, we finally present some interesting analyses on the fashion trend of menswear in the last 10 years",

In particular, we first train a linear classifier on the labeled data, then define a loss for the autoencoder with the weights learned from the linear classifier. To reduce the bias brought by one single classifier, we define a posterior probability distribution on the weights of the classifier, and derive the marginalized loss of the autoencoder with Laplace approximation. We show that our choice of loss function can be rationalized from the perspective of Bregman Divergence, which justifies the soundness of our model. We evaluate the effectiveness of our model on six sentiment analysis datasets, and show that our model significantly outperforms all the competing methods with respect to classification accuracy.

To capture the temporally extended nature of group engagement we implement a time-varying factorization. We test the assertion that latent preferences for groups and users are sparse in investigating elastic-net regularization.

    "abstract": "Binary code learning, a.k.a., hashing, has been recently popular due to its high efficiency in large-scale similarity search and recognition. It typically maps high-dimensional data points to binary codes, where data similarity can be efficiently computed via rapid Hamming distance. Most existing unsupervised hashing schemes pursue binary codes by reducing the quantization error from an original real-valued data space to a resulting Hamming space. On the other hand, most existing supervised hashing schemes constrain binary code learning to correlate with pairwise similarity labels. However, few methods consider ordinal relations in the binary code learning process, which serve as a very significant cue to learn the optimal binary codes for similarity search. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing scheme, dubbed Ordinal Embedding Hashing (OEH), which embeds given ordinal relations among data points to learn the ranking-preserving binary codes. The core idea is to construct a directed unweighted graph to capture the ordinal relations, and then train the hash functions using this ordinal graph to preserve the permutation relations in the Hamming space. To learn such hash functions effectively, we further relax the discrete constraints and design a stochastic gradient decent algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. Experimental results on two large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OEH method can achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-arts approaches.At last, the evaluation on query by humming dataset demonstrates the OEH also has good performance for music retrieval by using user's humming or singing",

In this paper, we propose a new framework called Privacy-CNH that utilizes hierarchical features which include both object and convolutional features in a deep learning model to detect privacy at risk photos. The generation of object features enables our model to better inform the users about the reason why a photo has privacy risk. The combination of convolutional and object features provide a richer model to understand photo privacy from different aspects, thus improving photo privacy detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art work and the standard convolutional neural network (CNN) with low-level features on photo privacy detection tasks",

    "title": "Deep Learning for Algorithm Portfolios",
    "abstract": "It is well established that in many scenarios there is no single solver that will provide optimal performance across a wide range of problem instances. Taking advantage of this observation, research into algorithm selection is designed to help identify the best approach for each problem at hand. This segregation is usually based on carefully constructed features, designed to quickly present the overall structure of the instance as a constant size numeric vector. Based on these features, a plethora of machine learning techniques can be utilized to predict the appropriate solver to execute, leading to significant improvements over relying solely on any one solver. However, being manually constructed, the creation of good features is an arduous task requiring a great deal of knowledge of the problem domain of interest. To alleviate this costly yet crucial step, this paper presents an automated methodology for producing an informative set of features utilizing a deep neural network. We show that the presented approach completely automates the algorithm selection pipeline and is able to achieve significantly better performance than a single best solver across multiple problem domains",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitous computing tasks, such as human activity recognition (HAR), are enabling a wide spectrum of applications, ranging from healthcare to environment monitoring. The success of a ubiquitous computing task relies on sufﬁcient physical sensor data with groundtruth labels, which are always scarce due to the expensive annotating process. Meanwhile, social media platforms provide a lot of social or semantic context information. People share what they are doing and where they are frequently in the messages they post. This rich set of socially shared activities motivates us to transfer knowledge from social media to address the sparsity issue of labelled physical sensor data. In order to transfer the knowledge of social and semantic context, we propose a Co-Regularized Heterogeneous Transfer Learning (CoHTL) model, which builds a common semantic space derived from two heterogeneous domains. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two ubiquitous computing tasks, namely human activity recognition and region function discovery",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in biologyhave produced a large number of gene expression patterns, many of which have been annotated textually with anatomical and developmental terms. These terms spatially correspond to local regions of the images, which are attached collectively to groups of images. Because one does not know which term is assigned to which region of which image in the group, the developmental stage classification and anatomical term annotation turn out to be a multi-instance learning (MIL) problem, which considers input as bags of instances and labels are assigned to the bags. Most existing MIL methods routinely use the Bag-to-Bag (B2B) distances, which, however, are often computationally expensive and may not truly reflect the similarities between the anatomical and developmental terms. In this paper, we approach the MIL problem from a new perspective using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distances, which directly assesses the relations between annotation terms and image panels. Taking into account the two challenging properties of multi-instance gene expression data, high heterogeneity and weak label association, we computes the C2B distance by introducing class specific distance metrics and locally adaptive significance coefficients.We apply our new approach to automatic gene expression pattern classification and annotation on the Drosophila melanogaster species. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our new method",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several probabilistic techniques have been applied to various debugging problems. However, most existing probabilistic debugging systems use relatively simple statistical models, and fail to generalize across multiple programs. In this work, we propose Tractable Fault Localization Models (TFLMs) that can be learned from data, and probabilistically infer the location of the bug. While most previous statistical debugging methods generalize over many executions of a single program, TFLMs are trained on a corpus of previously seen buggy programs, and learn to identify recurring patterns of bugs. Widely-used fault localization techniques such as TARANTULA evaluate the suspiciousness of each line in isolation; in contrast, a TFLM defines a joint probability distribution over buggy indicator variables for each line. Joint distributions with rich dependency structure are often computationally intractable; TFLMs avoid this by exploiting recent developments in tractable probabilistic models (specifically, Relational SPNs). Further, TFLMs can incorporate additional sources of information, including coverage-based features such as TARANTULA. We evaluate the fault localization performance of TFLMs that include TARANTULA scores as features in the probabilistic model. Our study shows that the learned TFLMs isolate bugs more effectively than previous statistical methods or using TARANTULA directly",

    "title": "Column Sampling Based Discrete Supervised Hashing",
    "abstract": "By leveraging semantic (label) information, supervised hashing has demonstrated better accuracy than unsupervised hashing in many real applications. Because the hashing-code learning problem is essentially a discrete optimization problem which is hard to solve, most existing supervised hashing methods try to solve a relaxed continuous optimization problem by dropping the discrete constraints. However, these methods typically suffer from poor performance due to the errors caused by the relaxation. Some other methods try to directly solve the discrete optimization problem. However, they are typically time-consuming and unscalable. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called column sampling based discrete supervised hashing (COSDISH), to directly learn the discrete hashing code from semantic information. COSDISH is an iterative method, in each iteration of which several columns are sampled from the semantic similarity matrix and then the hashing code is decomposed into two parts which can be alternately optimized in a discrete way. Theoretical analysis shows that the learning (optimization) algorithm of COSDISH has a constant-approximation bound in each step of the alternating optimization procedure. Empirical results on datasets with semantic labels illustrate that COSDISH can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in real applications like image retrieval",

    "abstract": "Graph-based image segmentation organizes the image elements into graphs and partitions an image based on the graph. It has been widely used and many promising results are obtained. Since the segmentation performance highly depends on the graph, most of existing methods focus on obtaining a precise similarity graph or on designing efficient cutting/merging strategies. However, these two components are often conducted in two separated steps, and thus the obtained graph similarity may not be the optimal one for segmentation and this may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Graph-Without-Cut (GWC), for learning the similarity graph and image segmentations simultaneously. GWC learns the similarity graph by assigning adaptive and optimal neighbors to each vertex based on the spatial and visual information. Meanwhile, the new rank constraint is imposed to the Laplacian matrix of the similarity graph, such that the connected components in the resulted similarity graph are exactly equal to the region number. Extensive empirical results on three public data sets (i.e, BSDS300, BSDS500 and MSRC) show that our unsupervised GWC achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with supervised and unsupervised image segmentation approaches",

(2014). The advantages of our approach will be illustrated from both theorical and empirical perspectives. We also give a new perspective for the matrix factorization method proposed by Levy and Goldberg (2014), in which the pointwise mutual information (PMI) matrix is considered as an analytical solution to the objective function of the skip-gram model with negative sampling proposed by Mikolov et al.

Unlike their approach which involves the use of the SVD for finding the low-dimensitonal projections from the PMI matrix, however, the stacked denoising autoencoder is introduced in our model to extract complex features and model non-linearities. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct experiments on clustering and visualization tasks, employing the learned vertex representations as features.

A challenging aspect of this process is that the model should be flexible and adaptive to reflect well patient-specific temporal behaviors and this also in the case when the available patient-specific data are sparse and short span. To address this problem we propose and develop an adaptive two-stage forecasting approach for modeling multivariate, irregularly sampled clinical time series of varying lengths. The proposed model (1) learns the population trend from a collection of time series for past patients; (2) captures individual-specific short-term multivariate variability; and (3) adapts by automatically adjusting its predictions based on new observations. The proposed forecasting model is evaluated on a real-world clinical time series dataset.

    "abstract": "In multi-label learning, there are two main challenges: missing labels and class imbalance (CIB). The former assumes that only a partial set of labels are provided for each training instance while other labels are missing. CIB is observed from two perspectives: first, the number of negative labels of each instance is much larger than its positive labels; second, the rate of positive instances (i.e. the number of positive instances divided by the total number of instances) of different classes are significantly different. Both missing labels and CIB lead to significant performance degradation. In this work, we propose a new method to handle these two challenges simultaneously. We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular minimization that is composed of a submodular objective function that encourages label consistency and smoothness, as well as, class cardinality bound constraints to handle class imbalance. We further present a convex approximation based on the Lovasz extension of submodular functions, leading to a linear program, which can be efficiently solved by the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

In the learning-to-teach step, the teachers reversely learn from the learner’s feedback to properly select the simplest examples for the next propagation.

    "title": "Scalable Completion of Nonnegative Matrix with Separable Structure",
    "abstract": "Matrix completion is to recover missing/unobserved values of a data matrix from very limited observations. Due to widely potential applications, it has received growing interests in fields from machine learning, data mining, to collaborative filtering and computer vision. To ensure the successful recovery of missing values, most existing matrix completion algorithms utilise the low-rank assumption, i.e., the fully observed data matrix has a low rank, or equivalently the columns of the matrix can be linearly represented by a few numbers of basis vectors. Although such low-rank assumption applies generally in practice, real-world data can process much richer structural information. In this paper, we present a new model for matrix completion, motivated by the separability assumption of nonnegative matrices from the recent literature of matrix factorisations: there exists a set of columns of the matrix such that the resting columns can be represented by their convex combinations. Given the separability property, which holds reasonably for many applications, our model provides a more accurate matrix completion than the low-rank based algorithms. Further, we derives a scalable algorithm to solve our matrix completion model, which utilises a randomised method to select the basis columns under the separability assumption and a coordinate gradient based method to automatically deal with the structural constraints in optimisation. Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed matrix completion model achieves competitive results on both synthetic and real datasets",

Consequently, linked samples are selected from a few sparsely-connected groups. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that the joint sparsity model outperforms traditional group sparsity model and graph sparsity model, as well as the latest group-graph sparsity model",

    "abstract": "General zero-shot learning (ZSL) approaches exploit transfer learning via semantic knowledge space. In this paper, we reveal a novel relational knowledge transfer (RKT) mechanism for ZSL, which is simple, generic and effective. RKT resolves the inherent semantic shift problem existing in ZSL through restoring the missing manifold structure of unseen categories via optimizing semantic mapping. It extracts the relational knowledge from data manifold structure in semantic knowledge space based on sparse coding theory. The extracted knowledge is then transferred backwards to generate virtual data for unseen categories in the feature space. On the one hand, the generalizing ability of the semantic mapping function can be enhanced with the added data. On the other hand, the mapping function for unseen categories can be learned directly from only these generated data, achieving inspiring performance. Incorporated with RKT, even simple baseline methods can achieve good results. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show prominent performance obtained by RKT, and we obtain 82.43% accuracy on the Animals with Attributes dataset",

    "abstract": "Learning in deep models using Bayesian methods has generated significant attention recently. This is largely because of the feasibility of modern Bayesian methods to yield scalable learning and inference, while maintaining a measure of uncertainty in the model parameters. Stochastic gradient MCMC algorithms (SG-MCMC) are a family of diffusion-based sampling methods for large-scale Bayesian learning. In SG-MCMC, multivariate stochastic gradient thermostats (mSGNHT) augment each parameter of interest, with a momentum and a thermostat variable to maintain stationary distributions as target posterior distributions. As the number of variables in a continuous-time diffusion increases, its numerical approximation error becomes a practical bottleneck, so better use of a numerical integrator is desirable. To this end, we propose use of an efficient symmetric splitting integrator in mSGNHT, instead of the traditional Euler integrator. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more accurate, robust, and converges faster. These properties are demonstrated to be desirable in Bayesian deep learning. Extensive experiments on two canonical models and their deep extensions demonstrate that the proposed scheme improves general Bayesian posterior sampling, particularly for deep models",

Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk.

From the statistic point of view, Dropout works by implicitly imposing an L2 regularizer on the weights. In this paper, we present a new training scheme: Shakeout. Instead of randomly discarding units as Dropout does at the training stage, our method randomly chooses to enhance or inverse the contributions of each unit to the next layer. We show that our scheme leads to a combination of L1 regularization and L2 regularization imposed on the weights, which has been proved effective by the Elastic Net models in practice.We have empirically evaluated the Shakeout scheme and demonstrated that sparse network weights are obtained via Shakeout training.

    "abstract": "Cluster validation constitutes one of the most challenging problems in unsupervised cluster analysis. For example, identifying the true number of clusters present in a dataset has been investigated for decades, and is still puzzling researchers today. The difficulty stems from the high variety of the dataset characteristics. Some datasets exhibit a strong structure with a few well-separated and normally distributed clusters, but most often real-world datasets contain possibly many overlapping non-gaussian clusters with heterogeneous variances and shapes. This calls for the design of robust clustering algorithms that could adapt to the structure of the data and in particular accurately guess the true number of clusters. They have recently been interesting attempts to design such algorithms, e.g. based on involved non-parametric statistical inference techniques. In this paper, we develop Viral Clustering (VC), a simple algorithm that jointly estimates the number of clusters and outputs clusters. The VC algorithm relies on two antagonist and interacting components. The first component tends to regroup neighbouring samples together, while the second component tends to spread samples in various clusters. This spreading component is performed using an analogy with the way virus spread over networks. We present extensive numerical experiments illustrating the robustness of the VC algorithm, and its superiority compared to existing algorithms",

Unfortunately, such an entropy criterion scales poorly in the numbers of candidate sampling locations and selected observations when optimized. To resolve this issue, we first exploit a structure common to sparse MOGP models for deriving a novel active learning criterion. Then, we exploit a relaxed form of submodularity property of our new criterion for devising a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a constant-factor approximation of that achieved by the optimal set of selected observations.

Accordingly, there has been a lot of work on \"superposition-structured\" models where multiple structural constraints are imposed. To efficiently solve these \"superposition-structured\" statistical models, we develop a framework based on a proximal Newton-type method. Employing the smoothed conic dual approach with the LBFGS updating formula, we propose a scalable and extensible proximal quasi-Newton (SEP-QN) framework. Empirical analysis on various datasets shows that our framework is potentially powerful, and achieves super-linear convergence rate for optimizing some popular \"superposition-structured\" statistical models such as the fused sparse group lasso",

    "abstract": "Dictionary learning has played an important role in the success of sparse representation. Although synthesis dictionary learning for sparse representation has been well studied for universality representation (i.e., the dictionary is universal to all classes) and particularity representation (i.e., the dictionary is class-particular), jointly learning an analysis dictionary and a synthesis dictionary is still in its infant stage. Universality-particularity representation can well match the intrinsic characteristics of data (i.e., different classes share commonality and distinctness), while analysis-synthesis dictionary can give a more complete view of data representation (i.e., analysis dictionary is a dual-viewpoint of synthesis dictionary). In this paper, we proposed a novel model of analysis-synthesis dictionary learning for universality-particularity (ASDL-UP) representation based classification. The discrimination of universality and particularity representation is jointly exploited by simultaneously learning a pair of analysis dictionary and synthesis dictionary. More specifically, we impose a label preserving term to analysis coding coefficients for universality representation. Fisher-like regularizations for analysis coding coefficients and the subsequent synthesis representation are introduced to particularity representation. Compared with other state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods, ASDL-UP has shown better or competitive performance in various classification tasks",

Existing approaches, however, have focused on propositional domains only. Without extensive feature engineering, it is difficult-if not impossible-to apply them within relational domains where we may have varying number of objects and relations among them. We therefore develop the first relational representation called Relational Continuous-Time Bayesian Networks (RCTBNs) that can address this challenge. It features a nonparametric learning method that allows for efficiently learning the complex dependencies and their strengths simultaneously from sequence data. Our experimental results demonstrate that RCTBNs can learn as effectively as state-of-the-art approaches for propositional tasks while modeling relational tasks faithfully",

    "abstract": "Feature selection has been widely recognized as one of the key problems in data mining and machine learning community, especially for high-dimensional data with redundant information, partial noises and outliers. Recently, unsupervised feature selection attracts substantial research attentions since data acquisition is rather cheap today but labeling work is still expensive and time consuming. This is specifically useful for effective feature selection of clustering tasks. Recent works using sparse projection with pre-learned pseudo labels achieve appealing results; however, they generate pseudo labels with all features so that noisy and ineffective features degrade the cluster structure and further harm the performance of feature selection; besides, these methods suffer from complex composition of multiple constraints and computational inefficiency, e.g., eigen-decomposition. Differently, in this work we introduce consensus clustering for pseudo labeling, which gets rid of expensive eigen-decomposition and provides better clustering accuracy with high robustness. In addition, complex constraints such as non-negative are removed due to the crisp indicators of consensus clustering. Specifically, we propose one efficient formulation for our unsupervised feature selection by using the utility function and provide theoretical analysis on optimization rules and model convergence. Extensive experiments on several popular data sets demonstrate that our methods are superior to the most recent state-of-the-art works in terms of NMI",

To address this limitation, we propose Distributed infinite Tucker (DinTucker), a new hierarchical Bayesian model that enables local learning of InfTucker on subarrays and global information integration from local results. We further develop a distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm, coupled with variational inference for model estimation. In addition, the connection between DinTucker and InfTucker is revealed in terms of model evidence. Experiments demonstrate that DinTucker maintains the predictive accuracy of InfTucker and is scalable on massive data: On multidimensional arrays with billions of elements from two real-world applications, DinTucker achieves significantly higher prediction accuracy with less training time, compared with the state-of-the-art large-scale tensor decomposition method, GigaTensor",

Combining transfer learning with active learning has attracted much research interest in recent years. Most existing works follow the setting where the class labels in source domain are the same as the ones in target domain. In this paper, we focus on a more challenging cross-class setting where the class labels are totally different in two domains but related to each other in an intermediary attribute space, which is barely investigated before. We propose a novel and effective method that utilizes the attribute representation as the seed parameters to generate the classification models for classes. And we propose a joint learning framework that takes into account the knowledge from the related classes in source domain, and the information in the target domain.

    "abstract": "While recent techniques for discriminative dictionary learning have attained promising results on the classification tasks, their performance is highly dependent on the number of labeled samples available for training. However, labeling samples is expensive and time consuming due to the significant human effort involved. In this paper, we present a novel semi- supervised dictionary learning method which utilizes the structural sparse relationships between the labeled and unlabeled samples. Specifically, by connecting the sparse reconstruction coefficients on both the original samples and dictionary, the unlabeled samples can be automatically grouped to the different labeled samples, and the grouped samples share a small number of atoms in the dictionary via mixed l2p- norm regularization. This makes the learned dictionary more representative and discriminative since the shared atoms are learned by using the labeled and unlabeled samples potentially from the same class. Minimizing the derived objective function is a challenging task because it is non-convex and highly non-smooth. We propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve the problem based on the block coordinate descent method. Moreover, we have a rigorous proof of the convergence of the algorithm.

We further show that robustness may not be achieved if the utility is non-Lipschitz. This suggests we should use a Lipschitz utility for AL if robustness is required. For the minimum cost setting, we can also obtain a robustness result for approximate AL algorithms. Our results imply that many commonly used AL algorithms are robust against perturbed priors. We then propose the use of a mixture prior to alleviate the problem of prior misspecification.

This work shows that instead of employing post-processing steps, substantially faster retrieval times can be achieved for the same accuracy when inference is not decoupled from the indexing process. By framing matrix factorization to be natively indexable, so that any solution is immediately sublinearly searchable, we use the machinery of Machine Learning to best learn such a solution. We introduce Indexable Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (IPMF) to shift the traditional post-processing complexity into the training phase of the model. Its inference procedure is based on Geodesic Monte Carlo, and adds minimal additional computational cost to standard Monte Carlo methods for matrix factorization. By coupling inference and indexing in this way, we achieve more than a 50% improvement in retrieval time against two state of the art methods, for a given level of accuracy in the recommendations of two large-scale recommender systems",

    "abstract": "Due to the storage and retrieval efficiency, hashing has been widely deployed to approximate nearest neighbor search for large-scale multimedia retrieval. Supervised hashing, which improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs, has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval, an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features, followed by another separate quantization step that generates binary codes. However, suboptimal hash coding may be produced, because the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the binary coding. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Hashing Network (DHN) architecture for supervised hashing, in which we jointly learn good image representation tailored to hash coding and formally control the quantization error. The DHN model constitutes four key components: (1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture image representations; (2) a fully-connected hashing layer to generate compact binary hash codes; (3) a pairwise cross-entropy loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a pairwise quantization loss for controlling hashing quality. Extensive experiments on standard image retrieval datasets show the proposed DHN model yields substantial boosts over latest state-of-the-art hashing methods",

    "title": "Flattening the Density Gradient for Eliminating Spatial Centrality to Reduce Hubness",
    "abstract": "Spatial centrality, whereby samples closer to the center of a dataset tend to be closer to all other samples, is regarded as one source of hubness. Hubness is well known to degrade k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN) classification. Spatial centrality can be removed by centering, i.e., shifting the origin to the global center of the dataset, in cases where inner product similarity is used. However, when Euclidean distance is used, centering has no effect on spatial centrality because the distance between the samples is the same before and after centering. As described in this paper, we propose a solution for the hubness problem when Euclidean distance is considered. We provide a theoretical explanation to demonstrate how the solution eliminates spatial centrality and reduces hubness. We then present some discussion of the reason the proposed solution works, from a viewpoint of density gradient, which is regarded as the origin of spatial centrality and hubness. We demonstrate that the solution corresponds to flattening the density gradient. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method improves k-NN classification performance and outperforms an existing hub-reduction method",

However, in many cases textual descriptions of these labels are available or can be easily constructed from public document sources such as Wikipedia. In this paper, we investigate an approach for embedding documents and labels into a joint space while sharing word representations between documents and labels. For finding such embeddings, we rely on the text of documents as well as descriptions for the labels. The use of such label descriptions not only lets us expect an increased performance on conventional multi-label text classification tasks, but can also be used to make predictions for labels that have not been seen during the training phase. The potential of our method is demonstrated on the multi-label classification task of assigning keywords from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to publications in biomedical research, both in a conventional and in a zero-shot learning setting",

However, the application of kernel PCA to large-scale problems remains a big challenge, due to its quadratic space complexity and cubic time complexity in the number of examples. To address this limitation, we utilize techniques from stochastic optimization to solve kernel PCA with linear space and time complexities per iteration. Specifically, we formulate it as a stochastic composite optimization problem, where a nuclear norm regularizer is introduced to promote low-rankness, and then develop a simple algorithm based on stochastic proximal gradient descent. During the optimization process, the proposed algorithm always maintains a low-rank factorization of iterates that can be conveniently held in memory. Compared to previous iterative approaches, a remarkable property of our algorithm is that it is equipped with an explicit rate of convergence. Theoretical analysis shows that the solution of our algorithm converges to the optimal one at an O(1/T) rate, where T is the number of iterations",

    "abstract": "People believe that depth plays an important role in success of deep neural networks (DNN). However, this belief lacks solid theoretical justifications as far as we know. We investigate role of depth from perspective of margin bound. In margin bound, expected error is upper bounded by empirical margin error plus Rademacher Average (RA) based capacity term. First, we derive an upper bound for RA of DNN, and show that it increases with increasing depth. This indicates negative impact of depth on test performance. Second, we show that deeper networks tend to have larger representation power (measured by Betti numbers based complexity) than shallower networks in multi-class setting, and thus can lead to smaller empirical margin error. This implies positive impact of depth. The combination of these two results shows that for DNN with restricted number of hidden units, increasing depth is not always good since there is a tradeoff between positive and negative impacts. These results inspire us to seek alternative ways to achieve positive impact of depth, e.g., imposing margin-based penalty terms to cross entropy loss so as to reduce empirical margin error without increasing depth. Our experiments show that in this way, we achieve significantly better test performance",

Although the Nyström approximation has been studied extensively and its application to kernel classification has been exhibited in several studies, there still exists a potentially large gap between the performance of classifier learned with  the Nyström approximation and that learned with  the original kernel. In this work, we make novel contributions to bridge the gap without increasing the training costs too much by proposing a refined Nyström based kernel classifier.  We adopt a two-step approach that in the first step we learn a sufficiently good dual solution and in the second step we use the obtained dual solution to construct a new set of bases for the Nyström approximation to re-train  a refined classifier. Our approach towards learning a good dual solution is based on a sparse-regularized dual formulation with the Nyström  approximation, which can be solved with the same time complexity as solving the standard formulation.  We justify our approach by establishing a theoretical guarantee on the error of the learned dual solution in the first step with respect to the optimal dual solution under appropriate conditions.   The experimental results demonstrate that (i) the obtained dual solution by our approach in the first step is closer to the optimal solution and yields improved prediction performance; and (ii) the second step using the obtained dual solution to re-train the model further improves the performance",

In this paper, we extend the deep representation learning to domain adaptation scenario, and propose a novel deep model called ``Deep Adaptive Exemplar AutoEncoder (DAE$^2$)''. Different from conventional denoising autoencoders using corrupted inputs, we assign semantics to the input-output pairs of the autoencoders, which allow us to gradually extract discriminant features layer by layer. To this end, first, we build a spectral bisection tree to generate source-target data compositions as the training pairs fed to autoencoders. Second, a low-rank coding regularizer is imposed to ensure the transferability of the learned hidden layer. Finally, a supervised layer is added on top to transform learned representations into discriminant features. The problem above can be solved iteratively in an EM fashion of learning. Extensive experiments on domain adaptation tasks including object, handwritten digits, and text data classifications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "abstract": "Metric learning has become a critical tool in many machine learning tasks. This paper focuses on learning an optimal Mahalanobis distance matrix (parameterized by a positive semi-definite matrix W) in the setting of supervised learning. Recently, particular research attention has been attracted by low-rank metric learning, which requires that matrix W is dominated by a few large singular values. In the era of high feature dimensions, low-rank metric learning effectively reduces the storage and computation overheads. However, existing low-rank metric learning algorithms usually adopt sophisticated regularization (such as LogDet divergence) for encouraging matrix low-rankness, which unfortunately incur iterative computations of matrix SVD. In this paper, we tackle low-rank metric learning by enforcing fixed-rank constraint on the matrix W. We harness the Riemannian manifold geometry of the collection of fixed-rank matrices and devise a novel second-order Riemannian retraction operator. The proposed operator is efficient and ensures that W always resides on the manifold. Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on benchmarks clearly suggest that the proposed algorithm is substantially superior or on par with the state-of-the-art in terms of k-NN classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed manifold retraction operator can be also naturally applied in generic rank-constrained machine learning algorithms",

However, DT models usually suffer from the curse of dimensionality and achieve degenerated performance when there are many noisy features. To address these issues, this paper first presents a novel data-dependent generalization error bound for the perceptron decision tree(PDT), which provides the theoretical justification to learn a sparse linear hyperplane in each decision node and to prune the tree. Following our analysis, we introduce the notion of sparse perceptron decision node (SPDN) with a budget constraint on the weight coefficients, and propose a sparse perceptron decision tree (SPDT) algorithm to achieve nonlinear prediction performance. To avoid generating an unstable and complicated decision tree and improve the generalization of the SPDT, we present a pruning strategy by learning classifiers to minimize cross-validation errors on each SPDN. Extensive empirical studies verify that our SPDT is more resilient to noisy features and effectively generates a small,yet accurate decision tree. Compared with state-of-the-art DT methods and SVM, our SPDT achieves better generalization performance on ultrahigh dimensional problems with more than 1 million features",

This could result in selecting mutually redundant kernels and affect the diversity of information sources utilized for clustering, which finally hurts the clustering performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes an MKKM clustering with a novel, effective matrix-induced regularization to reduce such redundancy and enhance the diversity of the selected kernels. We theoretically justify this matrix-induced regularization by revealing its connection with the commonly used kernel alignment criterion. Furthermore, this justification shows that maximizing the kernel alignment for clustering can be viewed as  a special case of our approach and indicates the extendability of the proposed matrix-induced regularization for designing better clustering algorithms. As experimentally demonstrated on five challenging MKL benchmark data sets, our algorithm significantly improves existing MKKM and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in the literature, verifying the effectiveness and advantages of incorporating the proposed matrix-induced regularization",

In relational modeling, the resulting blocks uncover the underlying interactions between two sets of entities of the relational data. Although some flexible axis-aligned partition processes, such as the Mondrian process, have been able to capture complex interacting patterns in a hierarchical fashion, they are still in short of capturing dependence between dimensions. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Ostomachion process (OP), which relaxes the cutting direction by allowing for oblique cuts. The partitions generated by an OP are convex polygons that can capture inter-dimensional dependence. The OP also exhibits interesting properties: 1) Along the time line the cutting times can be characterized by a homogeneous Poisson process, and 2) on the partition space the areas of the resulting components comply with a Dirichlet distribution. We can thus control the expected number of cuts and the expected areas of components through hyper-parameters. We adapt the reversible-jump MCMC algorithm for inferring OP partition structures. The experimental results on relational modeling and decision tree classification have validated the merit of the OP",

However, existing multivariate performance measure optimization methods are limited to single-view data, while traditional multi-view learning methods cannot optimize multivariate performance measures directly. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the problem of optimizing multivariate performance measures from multi-view data, and an effective method to solve it. We propose to learn linear discriminant functions for different views, and combine them to construct an overall multivariate mapping function for multi-view data. To learn the parameters of the linear discriminant functions of different views to optimize a given multivariate performance measure, we formulate an optimization problem. In this problem, we propose to minimize the complexity of the linear discriminant function of each view, promote the consistency of the responses of different views over the same data points, and minimize the upper boundary of the corresponding loss of a given multivariate performance measure. To optimize this problem, we develop an iterative cutting-plane algorithm. Experiments on four benchmark data sets show that it not only outperforms traditional single-view based multivariate performance optimization methods, but also achieves better results than ordinary multi-view learning methods",

We address this problem by proposing a simple and efficient seeding algorithm for K-Means clustering. The main idea is to replace the exact D2-sampling step in k-means++ with a substantially faster approximation based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We prove that, under natural assumptions on the data, the proposed algorithm retains the full theoretical guarantees of k-means++ while its computational complexity is only sublinear in the number of data points. For such datasets, one can thus obtain a provably good clustering in sublinear time.

To address this limitation, we first utilize random projection to find a rank-$k$ approximator for the data matrix, and reduce the cost of gradient evaluation to $\\mathcal{O}(nk+dk)$, a significant improvement when $k$ is much smaller than $d$ and $n$. Then, we solve the sparse linear regression problem via a proximal gradient method with a homotopy strategy to generate sparse intermediate solutions.

Many existing MTL approaches aim to learn the low-rank structure on the weight matrix, which stores the model parameters of all tasks, to achieve task sharing, and as a consequence the trace norm regularization is widely used in the MTL literature. A major limitation of these approaches based on trace norm regularization is that all the singular values of the weight matrix are penalized simultaneously, leading to impaired estimation on recovering the larger singular values in the weight matrix. To address the issue, we propose a Reduced rAnk MUlti-Stage multi-tAsk learning (RAMUSA) method based on the recently proposed capped norms. Different from existing trace-norm-based MTL approaches which minimize the sum of all the singular values, the RAMUSA method uses a capped trace norm regularizer to minimize only the singular values smaller than some threshold. Due to the non-convexity of the capped trace norm, we develop a simple but well guaranteed multi-stage algorithm to learn the weight matrix iteratively. We theoretically prove that the estimation error at each stage in the proposed algorithm shrinks and finally achieves a lower upper-bound as the number of stages becomes large enough.

    "title": "Reduction Techniques for Graph-Based Convex Clustering",
    "abstract": "The Graph-based Convex Clustering (GCC) method has gained increasing attention recently. The GCC method adopts a fused regularizer to learn the cluster centers and obtains a geometric clusterpath by varying the regularization parameter. One major limitation is that solving the GCC model is computationally expensive. In this paper, we develop efficient graph reduction techniques for the GCC model to eliminate edges, each of which corresponds to two data points from the same cluster, without solving the optimization problem in the GCC method, leading to improved computational efficiency. Specifically, two reduction techniques are proposed according to tree-based and cyclic-graph-based convex clustering methods separately. The proposed reduction techniques are appealing since they only need to scan the data once with negligibly additional cost and they are independent of solvers for the GCC method, making them capable of improving the efficiency of any existing solver. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our methods can largely improve the efficiency of the GCC model",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for the maximum a posteriori decoding (MAPD) of time-homogeneous Hidden Markov Models (HMM), improving the worst-case running time of the classical Viterbi algorithm by a logarithmic factor. In our approach, we interpret the Viterbi algorithm as a repeated computation of matrix-vector (max, +)-multiplications. On time-homogeneous HMMs, this computation is online: a matrix, known in advance, has to be multiplied with several vectors revealed one at a time. Our main contribution is an algorithm solving this version of matrix-vector (max,+)-multiplication in subquadratic time, by performing a polynomial preprocessing of the matrix. Employing this fast multiplication algorithm, we solve the MAPD problem in O(mn2/log n) time for any time-homogeneous HMM of size n and observation sequence of length m, with an extra polynomial preprocessing cost negligible for m > n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for the MAPD problem requiring subquadratic time per observation, under the assumption — usually verified in practice — that the transition probability matrix does not change with time",

In this paper, we propose isMets (Instance Specific METric Subspace) framework which can automatically span the whole metric space in a generative manner and is able to inductively learn a specific metric subspace for each instance via inferring the expectation over the metric bases in a Bayesian manner. The whole framework can be solved with Variational Bayes (VB). Experiment on synthetic data shows that the learned results are with good interpretability.

In this paper, we first define two tractable Schatten quasi-norms, i.e., Frobenius/nuclear hybrid and bi-nuclear quasi-norms, and then prove that they are in essence the Schatten-2/3 and 1/2 quasi-norms, respectively, which lead to the design of very efficient algorithms that only need to update two much smaller factor matrices. We also design two efficient proximal alternating linearzied minimization algorithms for solving representative matrix completion problems. Finally, we provide the global convergence and performance guarantees for our algorithms, which have better convergence properties than existing algorithms.

    "abstract": "Specifying a numeric reward function for reinforcement learning typically requires a lot of hand-tuning from a human expert. In contrast, preference-based reinforcement learning (PBRL) utilizes only pairwise comparisons between trajectories as a feedback signal, which are often more intuitive to specify. Currently available approaches to PBRL for control problems with continuous state/action spaces require a known or estimated model, which is often not available and hard to learn. In this paper, we integrate preference-based estimation of the reward function into a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, resulting in a model-free PBRL algorithm. Our new algorithm is based on Relative Entropy Policy Search (REPS), enabling us to utilize stochastic policies and to directly control the greediness of the policy update. REPS decreases exploration of the policy slowly by limiting the relative entropy of the policy update, which ensures that the algorithm is provided with a versatile set of trajectories, and consequently with informative preferences. The preference-based estimation is computed using a sample-based Bayesian method, which can also estimate the uncertainty of the utility. Additionally, we also compare to a linear solvable approximation, based on inverse RL. We show that both approaches perform favourably to the current state-of-the-art. The overall result is an algorithm that can learn non-parametric continuous action policies from a small number of preferences",

In practice, however, model mismatch is inevitable and while spectral learning remains appealingly fast and simple it may fail to find optimal models. To address this problem, we investigate the use of gradient methods for improving spectrally-learned PSRs.

We introduce a reinforcement learning method for sample-efficient policy search that exploits correlations between control variables. Such correlations are particularly frequent in motor skill learning tasks. The introduced method uses Variational Inference to estimate policy parameters, while at the same time uncovering a low-dimensional latent space of controls. Prior knowledge about the task and the structure of the learning agent can be provided by specifying groups of potentially correlated parameters. This information is then used to impose sparsity constraints on the mapping between the high-dimensional space of controls and a lower-dimensional latent space. In experiments with a simulated bi-manual manipulator, the new approach effectively identifies synergies between joints, performs efficient low-dimensional policy search, and outperforms state-of-the-art policy search methods",

We then relax assumption (1) and characterize the loss in learning performance when the similarity information must also be acquired through repeated sampling.  We further relax both (1) and (2) and present a cost-efficient algorithm that identifies a best crowd from a potentially large set of data sources in terms of both classifier performance and data acquisition cost.

Remarkable performance in multi-domain sentiment analysis datasets has been reported, making deep learning a promising approach to domain adaptation problems. SDAs are distinguished by learning robust data representations for recovering the original features that have been artificially corrupted with noise. The idea has been further exploited to marginalize out the random corruptions by a state-of-the-art method called mSDA. In this paper, a deep learning method for domain adaptation called l2,1-norm stacked robust autoencoders (l2,1-SRA) is proposed to learn useful representations for domain adaptation tasks. Each layer of l2,1-SRA contains two steps: a robust linear reconstruction step which is based on l2,1 robust regression and a non-linear squashing transformation step. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is very effective in multiple cross domain classification datasets which include Amazon review dataset, spam dataset from ECML/PKDD discovery challenge 2006 and 20 newsgroups dataset",

The original graph clustering methods are NP-hard problems. Traditional approaches used spectral relaxation to solve the graph clustering problems. The main disadvantage of these approaches is that the obtained spectral solutions could severely deviate from the true solution. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a new relaxation mechanism for graph clustering methods. Instead of minimizing the squared distances of clustering results, we use the l1-norm distance. More important, considering the normalized consistency, we also use the l1-norm for the normalized terms in the new graph clustering relaxations. Due to the sparse result from the l1-norm minimization, the solutions of our new relaxed graph clustering methods get discrete values with many zeros, which are close to the ideal solutions. Our new objectives are difficult to be optimized, because the minimization problem involves the ratio of nonsmooth terms. The existing sparse learning optimization algorithms cannot be applied to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm to solve this difficult non-smooth ratio minimization problem.

In this paper, a novel model-free algorithm is proposed, which makes use of constant shifting values (CSVs) estimated from prior knowledge. To encourage exploration during the learning process, the algorithm constantly subtracts the CSV from the rewards. A terminating condition is proposed to handle the unboundedness of Q-values caused by such substraction. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved under very mild assumptions. Furthermore, linear function approximation is investigated to generalize our method to handle large-scale tasks. Extensive experiments on representative MDPs and the popular game Tetris show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the state-of-the-art ones",

    "abstract": "With the recent proliferation of large-scale learning problems, there have been a lot of  interest on distributed machine learning algorithms, particularly those that are based  on  stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. However, existing algorithms either  suffer from slow convergence due to the inherent variance of stochastic gradients, or have a fast linear convergence rate but at the expense of poorer solution quality. In this paper, we combine their merits  by proposing a fast distributed asynchronous  SGD-based algorithm with variance reduction. A constant learning rate can be used, and it is also guaranteed to converge linearly to the optimal solution. Experiments on  the Google Cloud Computing Platform demonstrate that the proposed algorithm  outperforms state-of-the-art distributed asynchronous algorithms in terms of both wall  clock time and solution quality",

In this paper, we propose a novel S-shaped rectifiedlinear activation unit (SReLU) to learn both convexand non-convex functions, imitating the multiple function forms given by the two fundamental laws, namely the Webner-Fechner law and the Stevens law, in psychophysics and neural sciences. Specifically, SReLU consists of three piecewise linear functions, which are formulated by four learnable parameters. The SReLU is learned jointly with the training of the whole deep network through back propagation. During the training phase, to initialize SReLU in different layers, we propose a “freezing” method to degenerate SReLU into a predefined leaky rectified linear unit in the initial several training epochs and then adaptively learn the good initial values. SReLU can be universally used in the existing deep networks with negligible additional parameters and computation cost. Experiments with two popular CNN architectures, Network in Network and GoogLeNet on scale-various benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, MNIST and ImageNet demonstrate that SReLU achieves remarkable improvement compared to other activation functions",

    "title": "On Order-Constrained Transitive Distance Clustering",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of approximating order-constrained transitive distance (OCTD) and its clustering applications. Given any pairwise data, transitive distance (TD) is defined as the smallest possible \"gap\" on the set of paths connecting them. While such metric definition renders significant capability of addressing elongated clusters, it is sometimes also an over-simplified representation which loses necessary regularization on cluster structure and overfits to short links easily. As a result, conventional TD often suffers from degraded performance given clusters with \"thick\" structures. Our key intuition is that the maximum (path) order, which is the maximum number of nodes on a path, controls the level of flexibility. Reducing this order benefits the clustering performance by finding a trade-off between flexibility and regularization on cluster structure. Unlike TD, finding OCTD becomes an intractable problem even though the number of connecting paths is reduced. We therefore propose a fast approximation framework, using random samplings to generate multiple diversified TD matrices and a pooling to output the final approximated OCTD matrix. Comprehensive experiments on toy, image and speech datasets show the excellent performance of OCTD, surpassing TD with significant gains and giving state-of-the-art performance on several datasets",

Yet, finding the exact parameterization of the CTBN has often only secondary importance in practical scenarios. We therefore focus on the structure learning problem and present a way to analytically marginalize the Markov chain underlying the CTBN model with respect its parameters. Since the resulting stochastic process is parameter-free, its inference reduces to an optimal filtering problem.

In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain.  We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation.

This paper presents a novel text as network classification framework, which introduces 1) a structured and typed heterogeneous information networks (HINs) representation of texts, and 2) a meta-path based approach to link texts. We show that with the new representation and links of texts, the structured and typed information of entities and relations can be incorporated into kernels. Particularly, we develop both simple linear kernel and indefinite kernel based on meta-paths in the HIN representation of texts, where we call them HIN-kernels. Using Freebase, a well-known world knowledge base, to construct HIN for texts, our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the indefinite HIN kernel based on weighted meta-paths outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and other HIN-kernels",

However, most of the existing algorithms rely on the assumption that data can be stored in the computer memory. When data cannot fit in the memory, these algorithms will suffer severe performance degradations. In order to overcome this issue, we propose a novel sequential SC algorithm for tackling large-scale clustering with limited computational resources, \\textit{e.g.}, memory. We begin with investigating an effective way of approximating the graph affinity matrix via leveraging a bipartite graph. Then we choose a smart graph construction and optimization strategy to avoid random access to data. These efforts lead to an efficient SC algorithm whose memory usage is independent of the number of input data points.

Most of them focus on the matrix completion problem in real number domain, and produce continuous prediction values. However, these methods are not appropriate in some occasions where the entries of matrix are discrete values, such as movie ratings prediction, social network relation and interaction prediction, because their continuous outputs are not probabilities and uninterpretable. In this case, an additional step to process the continuous results with either heuristic threshold parameters or complicated mapping is necessary, while it is inefficient and may diverge from the optimal solution. There are a few matrix completion methods working on discrete number domain, however, they are not applicable to sparse and large-scale data set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal discrete matrix completion model, which is able to learn optimal thresholds automatically and also guarantees an exact low-rank structure of the target matrix. We use stochastic gradient descent algorithm with momentum method to optimize the new objective function and speed up optimization. In the experiments, it is proved that our method can predict discrete values with high accuracy, very close to or even better than these values obtained by carefully tuned thresholds on Movielens and YouTube data sets.

This operator can also be applied to discretized continuous space and time problems, and we provide empirical results evidencing superior performance in this context. Extending the idea of a locally consistent operator, we then derive sufficient conditions for an operator to preserve optimality, leading to a family of operators which includes our consistent Bellman operator.

However, there are a myriad of other useful metrics available, such as total variation, Hellinger distance, and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. This work develops the first random features for pdfs whose dot product approximates kernels using these non-Euclidean metrics. These random features allow estimators to scale to large datasets by working in a primal space, without computing large Gram matrices.

    "title": "Unsupervised Feature Selection on Networks: A Generative View",
    "abstract": "In the past decade, social and information networks have become prevalent, and research on the network data has attracted much attention. Besides the link structure, network data are often equipped with the content information (i.e, node attributes) that is usually noisy and characterized by high dimensionality. As the curse of dimensionality could hamper the performance of many machine learning tasks on networks (e.g., community detection and link prediction), feature selection can be a useful technique for alleviating such issue. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised feature selection on networks. Most existing feature selection methods fail to incorporate the linkage information, and the state-of-the-art approaches usually rely on pseudo labels generated from clustering. Such cluster labels may be far from accurate and can mislead the feature selection process. To address these issues, we propose a generative point of view for unsupervised features selection on networks that can seamlessly exploit the linkage and content information in a more effective manner. We assume that the link structures and node content are generated from a succinct set of high-quality features, and we find these features through maximizing the likelihood of the generation process. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our approach can select more discriminative features than state-of-the-art methods",

    "title": "A Probabilistic Approach to Knowledge Translation",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a novel knowledge reuse scenario where the knowledge in the source schema needs to be translated to a semantically heterogeneous target schema. We refer to this task as “knowledge translation” (KT). Unlike data translation and transfer learning, KT does not require any data from the source or target schema. We adopt a probabilistic approach to KT by representing the knowledge in the source schema, the mapping between the source and target schemas, and the resulting knowledge in the target schema all as probability distributions, specially using Markov random fields and Markov logic networks. Given the source knowledge and mappings, we use standard learning and inference algorithms for probabilistic graphical models to find an explicit probability distribution in the target schema that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the implicit distribution. This gives us a compact probabilistic model that represents knowledge from the source schema as well as possible, respecting the uncertainty in both the source knowledge and the mapping. In experiments on both propositional and relational domains, we find that the knowledge obtained by KT is comparable to other approaches that require data, demonstrating that knowledge can be reused without data",

    "title": "Incremental Stochastic Factorization for Online Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "A construct that has been receiving attention recently in reinforcement learning is stochastic factorization (SF), a particular case of non-negative factorization (NMF) in which the matrices involved are stochastic. The idea is to use SF to approximate the transition matrices of a Markov decision process (MDP). This is useful for two reasons. First, learning the factors of the SF instead of the transition matrices can reduce significantly the number of parameters to be estimated. Second, it has been shown that SF can be used to reduce the number of operations needed to compute an MDP's value function. Recently, an algorithm called expectation-maximization SF (EMSF) has been proposed to compute a SF directly from transitions sampled from an MDP. In this paper we take a closer look at EMSF. First, by exploiting the assumptions underlying the algorithm, we show that it is possible to reduce it to simple multiplicative update rules similar to the ones that helped popularize NMF. Second, we analyze the optimization process underlying EMSF and find that it minimizes a modified version of the Kullback-Leibler divergence that is particularly well-suited for learning a SF from data sampled from an arbitrary distribution. Third, we build on this improved understanding of EMSF to draw an interesting connection with NMF and probabilistic latent semantic analysis. We also exploit the simplified update rules to introduce a new version of EMSF that generalizes and significantly improves its precursor.  This new algorithm provides a practical mechanism to control the trade-off between memory usage and computing time, essentially freeing the space complexity of EMSF from its dependency on the number of sample transitions. The algorithm can also compute its approximation incrementally, which makes it possible to use it concomitantly with the collection of data. This feature makes the new version of EMSF particularly suitable for online reinforcement learning. Empirical results support the utility of the proposed algorithm",

In this work, we develop three new  evaluation approaches which guarantee that, given some history, algorithms are fed samples from the distribution that they would have encountered if they were run online.  Additionally, we are the first to propose an approach that is provably unbiased given finite data, eliminating bias due to the length of the evaluation.

This paper seeks to understand the difference in marginal value between decreasing the noise of the training set via relabeling and increasing the size and diversity of the (noisier) training set by labeling new examples. We use the term re-active learning to denote this generalization of active learning.

This is motivated by large modern datasets and ML toolkits with many combinations of learning algorithms and hyper-parameters. Inspired by the principle of \"optimism under uncertainty,\" we propose an innovative strategy, Data Allocation using Upper Bounds (DAUB), which robustly achieves these objectives across a variety of real-world datasets. We further develop substantial theoretical support for DAUB in an idealized setting where the expected accuracy of a classifier trained on $n$ samples can be known exactly. Under these conditions we establish a rigorous sub-linear bound on the regret of the approach (in terms of misallocated data), as well as a rigorous bound on suboptimality of the selected classifier. Our accuracy estimates using real-world datasets only entail mild violations of the theoretical scenario, suggesting that the practical behavior of DAUB is likely to approach the idealized behavior",

To address these problems, we propose a flexible time series pattern representation and selection framework, called the orthogonalpolynomial-based variant-nearest-neighbor (OPVNN) approach. For the respiratory motion prediction problem, the proposed approach achieved the highest and most robust prediction performance compared to the state-of-the-art time series prediction methods.

Specifically, we develop and analyze asynchronous AdaGrad-style algorithms from the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) and Mirror-Descent family that, unlike previous works, can handle projections and adapt both to the gradients and the delays, without relying  on  either strong convexity or smoothness of the objective function, or data sparsity. Our unified framework builds on a natural reduction from delayed-feedback to standard (non-delayed) online learning. This reduction, together with recent unification results for OCO algorithms, allows us to analyze the regret of generic FTRL and Mirror-Descent algorithms in the delayed-feedback setting in a unified manner using standard proof techniques. In addition, the reduction is exact and can be used to obtain both upper and lower bounds on the regret in the delayed-feedback setting",

    "abstract": "Social punishment, whereby cooperators punish defectors, has been suggested as an important mechanism that promotes the emergence of cooperation or maintenance of social norms in the context of the one-shot (i.e. non-repeated) interaction. However, whenever antisocial punishment, whereby defectors punish cooperators, is available, this antisocial behavior outperforms social punishment, leading to the destruction of cooperation. In this paper, we use evolutionary game theory to show that this antisocial behavior can be efficiently restrained by relying on prior commitments, wherein agents can arrange, prior to an interaction, agreements regarding posterior compensation by those who dishonor the agreements. We show that, although the commitment mechanism by itself can guarantee a notable level of cooperation, a significantly higher level is achieved when both mechanisms, those of proposing prior commitments and of punishment, are available in co-presence. Interestingly, social punishment prevails and dominates in this system as it can take advantage of the commitment mechanism to cope with antisocial behaviors. That is, establishment of a commitment system helps to pave the way for the evolution of social punishment and abundant cooperation, even in the presence of antisocial punishment",

We introduce and study two important special cases of the bribery problem, namely, FRUGAL-BRIBERY and FRUGAL-$BRIBERY where the briber is frugal in nature. By this, we mean that the briber is only able to influence voters who benefit from the suggestion of the briber. More formally, a voter is vulnerable if the outcome of the election improves according to her own preference when she accepts the suggestion of the briber. In the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes. In the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint. We show that both the FRUGAL-BRIBERY and the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problems are intractable for many commonly used voting rules for weighted as well as unweighted elections. These intractability results demonstrate that bribery is a hard computational problem, in the sense that several special cases of this problem continue to be computationally intractable.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to recovering from execution failures that relies on exploiting positive interactions between an agent's intentions.

We have implemented our approach in a scheduling algorithm for BDI agents which we call SP.

We experimentally validate our coordination approach in a variety of scenarios and show that its performance scales to scenarios with hundreds of agents",

    "abstract": "Many solution methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) exploit structure in the problem and are based on value function factorization. Especially multiagent settings, however, are known to suffer from an exponential increase in value component sizes as interactions become denser, restricting problem sizes and types that can be handled. We present an approach to mitigate this limitation for certain types of multiagent systems, exploiting a property that can be thought of as \"anonymous influence\" in the factored MDP. We show how representational benefits from anonymity translate into computational efficiencies, both for variable elimination in a factor graph and for the approximate linear programming solution to factored MDPs. Our methods scale to factored MDPs that were previously unsolvable, such as the control of a stochastic disease process over densely connected graphs with 50 nodes and 25 agents",

In domains featuring partial observability and uncertainty in the agents’ sensing and actuation, especially where communication among agents is sparse (as a part of a cost-minimized plan), plan monitoring can be a significant challenge. We design an Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm for detection of plan deviation of teammates in such a multi-agent system. However, a direct implementation of this algorithm is intractable, so we also design an alternative approach grounded on the agents’ plans, for tractability.

    "abstract": "Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) provide a general framework for multiagent sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Although Dec-POMDPs are typically intractable to solve for real-world problems, recent research on macro-actions (i.e., temporally-extended actions) has significantly increased the size of problems that can be solved. However, current methods assume the underlying Dec-POMDP model is known a priori or a full simulator is available during planning time. To accommodate more realistic scenarios, when such information is not available, this paper presents a policy-based reinforcement learning approach, which learns the agent policies based solely on trajectories generated by previous interaction with the environment (e.g., demonstrations). We show that our approach is able to generate valid macro-action controllers and develop an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm (called Policy-based EM or PoEM), which has convergence guarantees for batch learning. Our experiments show PoEM is a scalable learning method that can learn optimal policies and improve upon hand-coded “expert” solutions",

We assume that such models are not given to the agent, but instead must be learned from (possibly imperfect) observations of the other agents' behavior. The agent maintains a belief over the other agents' models, that is updated via Bayesian inference. To represent this belief we place a flexible stick-breaking distribution over PDFCs, that allows the posterior to concentrate around controllers whose size is not bounded and scales with the complexity of the observed data. Since this Bayesian inference task is not analytically tractable, we devise a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to approximate the posterior distribution. The agent then embeds the result of this inference into its own decision making process using the interactive POMDP framework. We show that our learning algorithm can learn agent models that are behaviorally accurate for problems of varying complexity, and that the agent's performance increases as a result",

    "title": "Temporal Vaccination Games under Resource Constraints",
    "abstract": "The decision to take vaccinations and other protective interventions for avoiding an infection is a natural game-theoretic setting. Most of the work on vaccination games has focused on decisions at the start of an epidemic. However, a lot of people defer their vaccination decisions, in practice. For example, in the case of the seasonal flu, vaccination rates gradually increase, as the epidemic rate increases. This motivates the study of temporal vaccination games, in which vaccination decisions can be made more than once. An important issue in the context of temporal decisions is that of resource limitations, which may arise due to production and distribution constraints. While there has been some work on temporal vaccination games, resource constraints have not been considered. In this paper, we study temporal vaccination games for epidemics in the SI (susceptible-infectious) model, with resource constraints in the form of a repeated game in complex social networks, with budgets on the number of vaccines that can be taken at any time. We find that the resource constraints and the vaccination and infection costs have a significant impact on the structure of Nash equilibria (NE). In general, the budget constraints can cause NE to become very inefficient, and finding efficient NE as well as the social optimum are NP-hard problems. We develop algorithms for finding NE and approximating the social optimum. We evaluate our results using simulations on different kinds of networks",

Given the success of distributed word representations learned from text, several techniques to infuse additional information from sources like WordNet into word representations have been proposed. In this paper, we follow an alternative route. We learn word representations from text and WordNet independently, and then explore simple and sophisticated methods to combine them. The combined representations are applied to an extensive set of datasets on word similarity and relatedness. Simple combination methods happen to perform better that more complex methods like CCA or retrofitting, showing that, in the case of WordNet, learning word representations separately is preferable to learning one single representation space or adding WordNet information directly. A key factor, which we illustrate with examples, is that the WordNet-based representations captures similarity relations encoded in WordNet better than retrofitting. In addition, we show that the average of the similarities from six word representations yields results beyond the state-of-the-art in several datasets, reinforcing the opportunities to explore further combination techniques",

We define a task-based method to quantify topic concentration in datasets, i.e., the ratio of sentences within the dataset that are relevant to the query, and observe that the DUC 2005, 2006 and 2007 datasets suffer from very high topic concentration. We introduce TD-QFS, a new QFS dataset with controlled levels of topic concentration. We compare competitive baseline algorithms on TD-QFS and report strong improvement in ROUGE performance for algorithms that properly model query relevance as opposed to generic summarizers.

We propose a simple yet effective approach to overcome this shortcoming. Our approach relies on the agreement between a pair of target-directional LSTMs, which generates more balanced targets. In addition, we develop two efficient approximate search methods for agreement that are empirically shown to be almost optimal in terms of sequence-level losses. Extensive experiments were performed on two standard sequence-to-sequence trans- duction tasks: machine transliteration and grapheme-to- phoneme transformation. The results show that the proposed approach achieves consistent and substantial im- provements, compared to six state-of-the-art systems.

However, distributional models cannot handle rare and morphologically complex words very well and fail to identify some fine-grained linguistic regularity as they are ignoring the word forms. On the contrary, morphology points out that words are built from some basic units, i.e., morphemes. Therefore, the meaning and function of such rare words can be inferred from the words sharing the same morphemes, and many syntactic relations can be directly identified based on the word forms. However, the limitation of morphology is that it cannot infer the relationship between two words that do not share any morphemes. Considering the advantages and limitations of both approaches, we propose two novel models to build better word representations by modeling both external contexts and internal morphemes in a jointly predictive way, called BEING and SEING. These two models can also be extended to learn phrase representations according to the distributed morphology theory. We evaluate the proposed models on similarity tasks and analogy tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed models can outperform state-of-the-art models significantly on both word and phrase representation learning",

    "abstract": "Without discourse connectives, classifying implicit discourse relations is a challenging task and a bottleneck for building a practical discourse parser. Previous research usually makes use of one kind of discourse framework such as PDTB or RST to improve the classification performance on discourse relations. Actually, under different discourse annotation frameworks, there exist multiple corpora which have internal connections. To exploit the combination of different discourse corpora, we design related discourse classification tasks specific to a corpus, and propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network embedded multi-task learning system to synthesize these tasks by learning both unique and shared representations for each task. The experimental results on the PDTB implicit discourse relation classification task demonstrate that our model achieves significant gains over baseline systems",

    "abstract": "Methods for learning word representations using large text corpora have received much attention lately due to their impressive performancein numerous natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as, semantic similarity measurement, and word analogy detection.Despite their success, these data-driven word representation learning methods do not considerthe rich semantic relational structure between words in a co-occurring context. On the other hand, already much manual effort has gone into the construction of semantic lexicons such as the WordNetthat represent the meanings of words by defining the various relationships that exist among the words in a language.We consider the question, can we improve the word representations learnt using a corpora by integrating theknowledge from semantic lexicons?. For this purpose, we propose a joint word representation learning method that simultaneously predictsthe co-occurrences of two words in a sentence subject to the relational constrains given by the semantic lexicon.We use relations that exist between words in the lexicon to regularize the word representations learnt from the corpus.Our proposed method statistically significantly outperforms previously proposed methods for incorporating semantic lexicons into wordrepresentations on several benchmark datasets for semantic similarity and word analogy",

An effective way is to extract meaningful matching patterns from words, phrases, and sentences to produce the matching score. Inspired by the success of convolutional neural network in image recognition, where neurons can capture many complicated patterns based on the extracted elementary visual patterns such as oriented edges and corners, we propose to model text matching as the problem of image recognition. Firstly, a matching matrix whose entries represent the similarities between words is constructed and viewed as an image. Then a convolutional neural network is utilized to capture rich matching patterns in a layer-by-layer way. We show that by resembling the compositional hierarchies of patterns in image recognition, our model can successfully identify salient signals such as n-gram and n-term matchings.

    "abstract": "Matching natural language sentences is central for many applications such as information retrieval and question answering. Existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. However, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. To tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. Specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through k-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. Our model has several advantages: (1) By using Bi-LSTM, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) By matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) Experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model",

We compare models that learn vector-space representations of the events denoted by verbs in chains centering on a single protagonist. We find that recent work on learning vector-space embeddings to capture word meaning can be effectively applied to this task, including simple incorporation of a verb's arguments in the representation by vector addition.

LIA uses a CCG semantic parser to ground the semantics of each command in terms of primitive executable procedures defining sensors and effectors of the agent. Given a natural language command that LIA does not understand, it prompts the user to explain how to achieve the command through a sequence of steps, also specified in natural language. A novel lexicon induction algorithm enables LIA to generalize across taught commands, e.g., having been taught how to \"forward an email to Alice,\" LIA can correctly interpret the command \"forward this email to Bob.\" A user study involving email tasks demonstrates that users voluntarily teach LIA new commands, and that these taught commands significantly reduce task completion time.

In contrast to current approaches that require language identification, our method is agnostic about the languages with which the documents in the corpus are expressed, and does not rely on parallel corpora to constrain the spaces. Instead we utilize a small set of human provided word translations---which are often freely and readily available. We can encode such word translations as hard constraints in the model's objective functions; however, we find that we can more naturally constrain the space by allowing words in one language to borrow distributional statistics from context words in another language. We achieve this via a process we term artificial code-switching. As the name suggests, we induce code-switching so that words across multiple languages appear in contexts together. Not only do embedding models trained on code-switched data learn common cross-lingual structure, the common structure allows an NLP model trained in a source language to generalize to multiple target languages (achieving up to 80% of the accuracy of models trained with target-language data)",

    "abstract": "In clinical documents, medical terms are often expressed in multi-word phrases. Traditional topic modelling approaches relying on the \"bag-of-words\" assumption are not effective in extracting topic themes from clinical documents. This paper proposes to first extract medical phrases using an off-the-shelf tool for medical concept mention extraction, and then train a topic model which takes a hierarchy of Pitman-Yor processes as prior for modelling the generation of phrases of arbitrary length. Experimental results on patients' discharge summaries show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art topical phrase extraction model on both perplexity and topic coherence measure and finds more interpretable topics",

However, because discourse structures describe the relationships between segments of discourse, word embeddings cannot be directly integrated to perform the task. In this paper, we introduce a mixed generative-discriminative framework, in which we use vector offsets between embeddings of words to represent the semantic relations between text segments and Fisher kernel framework to convert a variable number of vector offsets into a fixed length vector. In order to incorporate the weights of these offsets into the vector, we also propose the Weighted Fisher Vector. Experimental results on two different datasets show that the proposed method without using manually designed features can achieve better performance on recognizing the discourse level relations in most cases",

    "abstract": "We study tag recommendation for questions in community question answering (CQA). Tags represent the semantic summarization of questions are useful for navigation and expert finding in CQA and can facilitate content consumption such as searching and mining in these web sites.  The task is challenging, as both questions and tags are short and a large fraction of tags are tail tags which occur very infrequently. To solve these problems, we propose matching  questions and tags not only by themselves, but also by similar questions and similar tags. The idea is then formalized as a model in which we calculate question-tag similarity using a linear combination of similarity with similar questions and tags weighted by tag importance.Question similarity, tag similarity, and tag importance are learned in a supervised random walk framework by fusing multiple features. Our model thus can not only accurately identify question-tag similarity for head tags, but also improve the accuracy of recommendation of tail tags. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art  methods on tag recommendation for questions. Particularly, it improves tail tag recommendation accuracy by a large margin",

This paper proposes an effective way to automatically collect large scales of news-related multi-document summaries with reference to social media's reactions. We utilize two types of social labels in tweets, i.e., hashtags and hyper-links. Hashtags are used to cluster documents into different topic sets. Also, a tweet with a hyper-link often highlights certain key points of the corresponding document. We synthesize a linked document cluster to form a reference summary which can cover most key points. To this aim, we adopt the ROUGE metrics to measure the coverage ratio, and develop an Integer Linear Programming solution to discover the sentence set reaching the upper bound of ROUGE. Since we allow summary sentences to be selected from both documents and high-quality tweets, the generated reference summaries could be abstractive. Both informativeness and readability of the collected summaries are verified by manual judgment. In addition, we train a Support Vector Regression summarizer on DUC generic multi-document summarization benchmarks. With the collected data as extra training resource, the performance of the summarizer improves a lot on all the test sets. We release this dataset for further research",

To break the bottleneck of labeled data, a promising approach is to exploit easily obtained indirect supervision knowledge – which we usually refer to as distant supervision (DS).

In this paper, we propose a global distant supervision model for relation extraction, which can: 1) compensate the lack of supervision with a wide variety of indirect supervision knowledge; and 2) reduce the uncertainty in DS by performing joint inference across relation instances. Experimental results show that, by exploiting the consistency between relation labels, the consistency between relations and arguments, and the consistency between neighbor instances using Markov logic, our method significantly outperforms traditional DS approaches",

Traditional microblog sentiment classification methods usually use a single model to classify the messages from different users and omit individuality. However, microblogging users frequently embed their personal character, opinion bias and language habits into their messages, and the same word may convey different sentiments in messages posted by different users. In this paper, we propose a personalized approach for microblog sentiment classification. In our approach, each user has a personalized sentiment classifier, which is decomposed into two components, a global one and a user-specific one. Our approach can capture the individual personality and at the same time leverage the common sentiment knowledge shared by all users. The personalized sentiment classifiers of massive users are trained in a collaborative way based on multi-task learning to handle the data sparseness problem. In addition, we incorporate users' social relations into our model to strengthen the learning of the personalized models. Moreover, we propose a distributed optimization algorithm to solve our model in parallel. Experiments on two real-world microblog sentiment datasets validate that our approach can improve microblog sentiment classification accuracy effectively and efficiently",

Seminal methods extract manual discrete features from automatic syntactic parse trees in order to capture semantic information of the enclosing sentence with respect to a target entity mention. Recently, it has been shown that competitive accuracies can be achieved without using syntactic parsers, which can be highly inaccurate on noisy text such as tweets. This is achieved by applying distributed word representations and rich neural pooling functions over a simple and intuitive segmentation of tweets according to target entity mentions. In this paper, we extend this idea by proposing a sentence-level neural model to address the limitation of pooling functions, which do not explicitly model tweet-level semantics. First, a bi-directional gated neural network is used to connect the words in a tweet so that pooling functions can be applied over the hidden layer instead of words for better representing the target and its contexts. Second, a three-way gated neural network structure is used to model the interaction between the target mention and its surrounding contexts. Experiments show that our proposed model gives significantly higher accuracies compared to the current best method for targeted sentiment analysis",

The pipeline strategy first constructs the alignments independently, and then uses the obtained alignments to construct queries. However, alignment construction is not a trivial task, and the introduced noises would be passed on to query construction. By contrast, we notice that alignment construction and query construction are interactive steps, and jointly considering them would be beneficial. To this end, we present a novel joint model based on integer linear programming (ILP), uniting these two procedures into a uniform framework.

In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework to assign temporal labels on highlighted video shots. To be specific, due to the informal expression of bullet-screen comments, we first propose a temporal deep structured semantic model (T-DSSM) to represent comments into semantic vectors by taking advantage of their temporal correlation. Then, video highlights are recognized and labeled via semantic vectors in a supervised way. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset prove that our framework could effectively label video highlights with a significant margin compared with baselines, which clearly validates the potential of our framework on video understanding, as well as bullet-screen comments interpretation",

However, in our preliminary experiments, this naive method actually failed to improve the why-QA performance. The main reason was that the machine-generated questions were often incomprehensible like \"Why does (it) happen?\", and that the system suffered from overfitting to the results of our automatic causality recognizer. Hence, we developed a novel method that effectively filters out incomprehensible questions and retrieves from texts answers that are likely to be paraphrases of a given causal relation. Through a series of experiments, we showed that our approach significantly improved the precision of the top answer by 8% over the current state-of-the-art system for Japanese why-QA",

Different from most previous studies that address novel entity discovery as a submodule of entity linking systems, our model is more a generalized approach and can be applied as a pre-filtering step of novel entities for any entity linking systems. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on identifying novel entities",

    "abstract": "We address two key challenges in end-to-end event coreference resolution research: (1) the error propagation problem, where an event coreference resolver has to assume as input the noisy outputs produced by its upstream components in the standard information extraction (IE) pipeline; and (2) the data annotation bottleneck, where manually annotating data for all the components in the IE pipeline is prohibitively expensive. This is the case in the vast majority of the world's natural languages, where such annotated resources are not readily available. To address these problems, we propose to perform joint inference over a lightly supervised IE pipeline, where all the models are trained using either active learning or unsupervised learning. Using our approach, only 25% of the training sentences in the Chinese portion of the ACE 2005 corpus need to be annotated with entity and event mentions in order for our event coreference resolver to surpass its fully supervised counterpart in performance",

In narrative stories and personal conversations, recognizing  that some events have a strong affective polarity is essential to  understand the discourse and the emotional states of the affected  people.  However, current NLP systems mainly depend on sentiment  analysis tools, which fail to recognize many events that are  implicitly affective based on human knowledge about the event itself and cultural norms. Our goal is to automatically acquire knowledge of stereotypically positive and negative events from personal blogs.  Our research creates an event context graph from a large collection of blog posts  and uses a sentiment classifier and semi-supervised label propagation  algorithm to discover affective events. We explore several graph  configurations that propagate affective polarity across edges using  local context, discourse proximity, and event-event co-occurrence.  We then harvest highly affective events from the graph and evaluate the agreement of the polarities with human judgements",

In this paper, we introduce the task of microsummarization, which combines sentiment analysis, summarization, and entity recognition in order to surface key content to users. We explore unsupervised and supervised methods for this task, and find we can reliably extract relevant entities and the sentiment targeted towards them using crowdsourced labels as supervision.

Our approach of finding the terminal value function is to learn a mapping from an MDP to its value function by solving many similar MDPs during a training phase and fit a regression estimator.

We show that an approximately optimal non-simple path can be efficiently computed under some natural constraints.

    "abstract": "The global growth in urbanisation increases the demand for services including road transport infrastructure, presenting challenges in terms of mobility. In this scenario, optimising the exploitation of urban road networks is a pivotal challenge. Existing urban traffic control approaches, based on complex mathematical models, can effectively deal with planned-ahead events, but are not able to cope with unexpected situations --such as roads blocked due to car accidents or weather-related events-- because of their huge computational requirements. Therefore, such unexpected situations are mainly dealt with manually, or by exploiting pre-computed policies. Our goal is to show the feasibility of using mixed discrete-continuous planning to deal with unexpected circumstances in urban traffic control. We present a PDDL+ formulation of urban traffic control, where continuous processes are used to model flows of cars, and show how planning can be used to efficiently reduce congestion of specified roads by controlling traffic light green phases.

A model with partial observability is relevant to goal recognition applications such as assisted cognition and security, which suffer from reduced observability due to sensor malfunction or lack of sufficient budget.

    "abstract": "In contingent planning under partial observability with sensing actions, agents actively use sensing to discover meaningful facts about the world. For this class of problems the solution can be represented as a plan tree, branching on various possible observations. Recent successful approaches translate the partially observable contingent problem into a non-deterministic fully observable problem, and then use a planner for non-deterministic planning. While this approach has been successful in many domains, the translation may become very large, encumbering the task of the non-deterministic planner. In this paper we suggest a different approach - using an online contingent solver repeatedly to construct a plan tree. We execute the plan returned by the online solver until the next observation action, and then branch on the possible observed values, and replan for every branch independently. In many cases a plan tree can be exponential in the number of state variables, but still, the tree has a structure that allows us to compactly represent it using a directed graph. We suggest a mechanism for tailoring such a graph that reduces both the computational effort and the storage space. Furthermore, unlike recent state of the art offline planners, our approach is not bounded to a specific class of contingent problems, such as limited problem width, or simple contingent problems.

    "title": "Randomised Procedures for Initialising and Switching Actions in Policy Iteration",
    "abstract": "Policy Iteration (PI) (Howard 1960) is a classical method for computing an optimal policy for a finite Markov Decision Problem (MDP). The method is conceptually simple: starting from some initial policy, “policy improvement” is repeatedly performed to obtain progressively dominating policies, until eventually, an optimal policy is reached. Being remarkably efficient in practice, PI is often favoured over alternative approaches such as Value Iteration and Linear Programming. Unfortunately, even after several decades of study, theoretical bounds on the complexity of PI remain unsatisfactory. For an MDP with n states and k actions, Mansour and Singh (1999) bound the number of iterations taken by Howard’s PI, the canonical variant of the method, by O(kn / n). This bound merely improves upon the trivial bound of kn by a linear factor. However, a randomised variant of PI introduced by Mansour and Singh (1999) does yield an exponential improvement, with its expected number of iterations bounded by O(((1 + 2/log2(k)) k / 2)n).With the objective of furnishing improved upper bounds for PI, we introduce two randomised procedures in this paper. Our first contribution is a routine to find a good initial policy for PI. After evaluating a number of randomly generated policies, this procedure applies a novel criterion to pick one to initialise PI. When PI is subsequently applied, we show that the expected number of policy evaluations—including both the initialisation and the improvement stages—remains bounded in expectation by O(kn/2). The key construction employed in this routine is a total order on the set of policies. Our second contribution is a randomised action-switching rule for PI, which admits a bound of O((2 + ln(k – 1))n) on the expected number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the tightest complexity bound known for PI when k >= 3",

As our first contributionin this work, we show that a much broader classof algebraic constraints can be collapsed by leveraging the properties of a Dirac delta model of deterministic constraints. Unfortunately, the collapsing processcan lead to highly piecewise densities that pose challenges for existing probabilistic inference tools. Thus,our second contribution to address these challenges is to present a variation of Gibbs sampling that efficiently samples from these piecewise densities. The key insight to achieve this is to introduce a class of functions that (1) is sufficiently rich to approximate arbitrary models up to arbitrary precision, (2) is closed under dimension reduction (collapsing) for models with (non)linear algebraic constraints and (3) always permits one analytical integral sufficient to automatically derive closed-form conditionals for Gibbs sampling. Experiments demonstrate the proposed sampler converges at least an order of magnitude faster than existing Monte Carlo samplers",

    "title": "From Exact to Anytime Solutions for Marginal MAP",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the anytime performance of search-based algorithms for solving the Marginal MAP task over graphical models. The current state of the art for solving this challenging task is based on best-first search exploring the AND/OR graph with the guidance of heuristics based on mini-bucket and variational cost-shifting principles. Yet, those schemes are uncompromising in that they solve the problem exactly, or not at all, and often suffer from memory problems. In this work, we explore the well known principle of weighted search for converting best-first search solvers into anytime schemes. The weighted best-first search schemes report a solution early in the process by using inadmissible heuristics, and subsequently improve the solution. While it was demonstrated recently that weighted schemes can yield effective anytime behavior for pure MAP tasks, Marginal MAP is far more challenging (e.g., a conditional sum must be evaluated for every solution). Yet, in an extensive empirical analysis we show that weighted schemes are indeed highly effective for Marginal MAP yielding the most competitive schemes to date for this task",

Exact samples can, in principle, be obtained by computing the mode of the original model perturbed with an exponentially many i.i.d. random variables. We propose a novel algorithm that views this as a combinatorial optimization problem and searches for the extreme state using a standard integer linear programming (ILP) solver, appropriately extended to account for the random perturbation. Our technique, GumbelMIP, leverages linear programming (LP) relaxations to evaluate the qualityof samples and prune large portions of the search space, and can thus scale to large tree-width models beyond the reach of current exact inference methods. Further, when the optimization problem is not solved to optimality, our method yields a novel approximate sampling technique. We empirically demonstrate that our approach parallelizes well, our exact sampler scales better than alternative approaches, and our approximate sampler yields better quality samples than a Gibbs sampler and a low-dimensional perturbation method",

A key characteristic of these problems is that matching of services to customers in one round has a direct impact on the matching of services to customers in the next round. For instance, in the case of taxis, in the second round taxis can only pick up customers closer to the drop off point of the customer from the first round of matching.  Traditionally,  greedy myopic approaches have been adopted to address such large scale online matching problems. While they provide solutions in a scalable manner, due to their myopic nature the quality of matching obtained can be improved significantly (demonstrated in our experimental results).  In this paper, we present a two stage stochastic optimization formulation to consider expected future demand.

We present a lighter weight filtering algorithm for incNGs in the context of restart-based search using dynamic event sets (dynamic subscriptions). We show formally that the lightweight version enforces GAC on each nogood while reducing the number of subscribed decisions. The paper also introduces an efficient approximation to nogood minimization such that all shortened reduced nld-nogoods from the same restart are also increasing and can be propagated with the new filtering algorithm.

We achieve this by framing the problem as a deep learning task and exploit sequence models in the form of recurrent neural networks to learn a mapping from sensor measurements to object tracks. In particular, we propose a learning method based on a form of input dropout which allows learning in an unsupervised manner, only based on raw, occluded sensor data without access to ground-truth annotations. We demonstrate our approach using a synthetic dataset designed to mimic the task of tracking objects in 2D laser data — as commonly encountered in robotics applications — and show that it learns to track many dynamic objects despite occlusions and the presence of sensor noise",

    "abstract": "To solve ever more complex and longer tasks, mobile robots need to generate more elaborate plans and must handle dynamic environments and incomplete knowledge. We address this challenge by integrating two seemingly different approaches — PDDL-based planning for efficient plan generation and Golog for highly expressive behavior specification — in a coherent framework that supports continual planning. The latter allows to interleave plan generation and execution through assertions, which are placeholder actions that are dynamically expanded into conditional sub-plans (using classical planners) once a replanning condition is satisfied. We formalize and implement continual planning in Golog which was so far only supported in PDDL-based systems. This enables combining the execution of generated plans with regular Golog programs and execution monitoring. Experiments on autonomous mobile robots show that the approach supports expressive behavior specification combined with efficient sub-plan generation to handle dynamic environments and incomplete knowledge in a unified way",

However, the significant performance decline with decreasing resolution is a major bottleneck of current state-of-the-art methods. For the popular boosting-based detectors, one of the main reasons is that low resolution samples, which are usually more difficult to detect than high resolution ones, are treated by equal costs in the boosting process, leading to the consequence that they are more easily being rejected in early stages and can hardly be recovered in late stages as false negatives. To address this problem, we propose in this paper a new multi-resolution detection approach based on a novel group cost-sensitive boosting algorithm, which extends the popular AdaBoost by exploring different costs for different resolution groups in the boosting process, and places more emphases on low resolution group in order to better handle detection of hard samples.

This task is tackled through a model that partitions vehicle camera input into distinct semantic classes, by taking into account visual contextual cues. The use of structured machine learning models is investigated, which not only allow for complex input, but also arbitrarily structured output. Towards this goal, an outdoor road scene dataset is constructed with accompanying fine-grained image labelings. For coherent segmentation, a structured predictor is modeled to encode label distributions conditioned on the input images. After optimizing this model through max-margin learning, based on an ontological loss function, efficient classification is realized via graph cuts inference using alpha-expansion. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that by taking into account contextual relations between pixel segmentation regions within a second-degree neighborhood, spurious label assignments are filtered out, leading to highly accurate semantic segmentations for outdoor scenes",

Using the selected neurons as supervisionto mimic the single networks of DeepID2+ andDeepID3, which are the state-of-the-art face recognition systems, a compact student with simple network structure achieves better verification accuracy on LFW than its teachers, respectively.

For handling the model drift problem caused by occlusion or distracter, we propose saliency proposals as prior information to provide candidates and reduce background interference. In addition to saliency proposals, a ranking strategy is proposed to determine the importance of these proposals by exploiting the learnt appearance filter, historical preserved object samples and the distracting proposals. In this way, the proposed approach could effectively explore the color-gradient characteristics and alleviate the model drift problem.

Repair of missing or damaged pixels is essential for video maintenance and preservation. Most methods seek to fill in missing holes by synthesizing similar textures from local or global frames. However, this can introduce incorrect contexts, especially when the missing hole or number of damaged frames is large. Furthermore, simple texture synthesis can introduce artifacts in undamaged and recovered areas. To address aforementioned problems, we propose the diversified dynamical Gaussian process latent variable model (D2GPLVM) for considering the variety in existing videos and thus introducing a diversity encouraging prior to inducing points. The aim is to ensure that the trained inducing points, which are a smaller set of all observed undamaged frames, are more diverse and resistant for context-aware and artifacts-free based video repair.

Supervised hashing improves the quality of hash coding by exploiting the semantic similarity on data pairs and has received increasing attention recently. For most existing supervised hashing methods for image retrieval, an image is first represented as a vector of hand-crafted or machine-learned features, then quantized by a separate quantization step that generates binary codes. However, suboptimal hash coding may be produced, since the quantization error is not statistically minimized and the feature representation is not optimally compatible with the hash coding. In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Quantization Network (DQN) architecture for supervised hashing, which learns image representation for hash coding and formally control the quantization error. The DQN model constitutes four key components: (1) a sub-network with multiple convolution-pooling layers to capture deep image representations; (2) a fully connected bottleneck layer to generate dimension-reduced representation optimal for hash coding; (3) a pairwise cosine loss layer for similarity-preserving learning; and (4) a product quantization loss for controlling hashing quality and the quantizability of bottleneck representation.

To explore their interaction, this work proposes an end-to-end learning framework called DARI, i.e. Distance metric And Representation Integration, and validates the effectiveness of DARI in the challenging task of person verification. Given the training images annotated with the labels, we first produce a large number of triplet units, and each one contains three images, i.e. one person and the matched/mismatch references. For each triplet unit, the distance disparity between the matched pair and the mismatched pair tends to be maximized. We solve this objective by building a deep architecture of convolutional neural networks. In particular, the Mahalanobis distance matrix is naturally factorized as one top fully-connected layer that is seamlessly integrated with other bottom layers representing the image feature. The image feature and the distance metric can be thus simultaneously optimized via the one-shot backward propagation. On several public datasets, DARI shows very promising performance on re-identifying individuals cross cameras against various challenges, and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches",

    "title": "Multi-View 3D Human Tracking in Crowded Scenes",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust multi-view method for tracking people in 3D scene. Our method distinguishes itself from previous works in two aspects. Firstly, we define a set of binary spatial relationships for individual subjects or pairs of subjects that appear at the same time, e.g. being left or right, being closer or further to the camera, etc. These binary relationships directly reflect relative positions of subjects in 3D scene and thus should be persisted during inference. Secondly, we introduce an unified probabilistic framework to exploit binary spatial constraints for simultaneous 3D localization and cross-view human tracking. We develop a cluster Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to search the optimal solution. We evaluate our method on both public video benchmarks and newly built multi-view video dataset. Results with comparisons showed that our method could achieve state-of-the-art tracking results and meter-level 3D localization on challenging videos",

    "abstract": "We propose a simple but effective unsupervised learning algorithm to detect a common activity (co-activity) from a set of videos, which is formulated using absorbing Markov chain in a principled way. In our algorithm, a complete multipartite graph is first constructed, where vertices correspond to subsequences extracted from videos using a temporal sliding window and edges connect between the vertices originated from different videos; the weight of an edge is proportional to the similarity between the features of two end vertices. Then, we extend the graph structure by adding edges between temporally overlapped subsequences in a video to handle variable-length co-activities using temporal locality, and create an absorbing vertex connected from all other nodes. The proposed algorithm identifies a subset of subsequences as co-activity by estimating absorption time in the constructed graph efficiently. The great advantage of our algorithm lies in the properties that it can handle more than two videos naturally and identify multiple instances of a co-activity with variable lengths in a video. Our algorithm is evaluated intensively in a challenging dataset and illustrates outstanding performance quantitatively and qualitatively",

    "abstract": "Vast quantities of videos are now being captured at astonishing rates, but the majority of these are not labelled.  To cope with such data, we consider the task of content-based activity recognition in videos without any manually labelled examples, also known as zero-shot video recognition. To achieve this, videos are represented in  terms of detected visual concepts, which are then scored as relevant or irrelevant according to their similarity with a given textual query.  In this paper, we propose a more robust approach for scoring concepts in order to alleviate many of the brittleness and low precision problems of previous work. Not only do we jointly consider semantic relatedness, visual reliability, and discriminative power. To handle noise and non-linearities in the ranking scores of the selected concepts, we propose a novel pairwise order matrix approach for score aggregation.

We show how this can be estimated using as few as a single labeled training sample per class. Then, using these feature signs, we extend an initial supervised learning problem into an (almost) unsupervised clustering formulation that can incorporate new data without requiring ground truth labels. Our method works both as a feature selection mechanism and as a fully competitive classifier. It has important properties, low computational cost annd excellent accuracy, especially in difficult cases of very limited training data.

However, existing methods are limited because (1) they are sensitive to noise often resulting in a large number of false alarms; and (2) they rely on elaborate models leading to high computational cost thus unsuitable for processing a large number of video inputs in real-time. In this paper, we overcome these limitations  by introducing a novel complex behaviour modeling framework, which consists of a Binarized Cumulative Directional (BCD) feature as representation, novel spatial and  temporal context modeling via an iterative correlation maximization, and a set of behaviour models, each being a simple Bernoulli distribution. Despite its simplicity, our experiments on three benchmark datasets show  that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for both temporal video segmentation and rare event detection. Importantly, it is extremely efficient — reaches 90Hz on a normal PC platform using MATLAB",

Inspired by hierarchical object representation and recent application of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) on human pose estimation, we propose a novel formulation that incorporates both hierarchical exemplar-based models and DCNNs in the spatial terms. Specifically, we obtain more expressive spatial models by assuming independence between exemplars at different levels in the hierarchy; we also obtain stronger spatial constraints by inferring the spatial relations between parts at the same level. As our method strikes a good balance between expressiveness and strength of spatial models, it is both effective and generalizable, achieving state-of-the-art results on different benchmarks: Leeds Sports Dataset and CUB-200-2011",

In this paper, we describe a novel multimodal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture which seamlessly unifies both visual and auditory modalities from the beginning of each sequence input. The key idea is to extend the conventional LSTM by not only sharing weights across time steps, but also sharing weights across modalities. We show that modeling the temporal dependency across face and voice can significantly improve the robustness to content quality degradations and variations. We also found that our multimodal LSTM is robustness to distractors, namely the non-speaking identities. We applied our multimodal LSTM to The Big Bang Theory dataset and showed that our system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems in speaker identification with lower false alarm rate and higher recognition accuracy",

    "abstract": "Viewpoint estimation, especially in case of multiple object classes, remains an important and challenging problem. First, objects under different views undergo extreme appearance variations, often making within-class variance larger than between-class variance. Second, obtaining precise ground truth for real-world images, necessary for training supervised viewpoint estimation models, is extremely difficult and time consuming. As a result, annotated data is often available only for a limited number of classes. Hence it is desirable to share viewpoint information across classes. Additional complexity arises from unaligned pose labels between classes, i.e. a side view of a car might look more like a frontal view of a toaster, than its side view. To address these problems, we propose a metric learning approach for joint class prediction and pose estimation. Our approach allows to circumvent the problem of viewpoint alignment across multiple classes, and does not require dense viewpoint labels. Moreover, we show, that the learned metric generalizes to new classes, for which the pose labels are not available, and therefore makes it possible to use only partially annotated training sets, relying on the intrinsic similarities in the viewpoint manifolds. We evaluate our approach on two challenging multi-class datasets, 3DObjects and PASCAL3D+",

In principle, zero-shot learning makes it possible to train an event detection model based on the assumption that events (e.g. birthday party) can be described by multiple mid-level semantic concepts (e.g. ``blowing candle'', ``birthday cake''). Towards this goal, we first pre-train a bundle of concept classifiers using data from other sources. Then we evaluate the semantic correlation of each concept w.r.t. the event of interest and pick up the relevant concept classifiers, which are applied on all test videos to get multiple prediction score vectors. While most existing systems combine the predictions of the concept classifiers with fixed weights, we propose to learn the optimal weights of the concept classifiers for each testing video by exploring a set of online available videos with free-form text descriptions of their content. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have conducted extensive experiments on the latest TRECVID MEDTest 2014, MEDTest 2013 and CCV dataset.

The commonsense theories of psychology and sociology necessary for such inferences have been a focus of logic-based knowledge representation research, but have been difficult to employ in robust automated reasoning architectures. In this paper we model behavior interpretation as a process of logical abduction, where the reasoning task is to identify the most probable set of assumptions that logically entail the observable behavior of others, given commonsense theories of psychology and sociology. We evaluate our approach using Triangle-COPA, a benchmark suite of 100 challenge problems based on an early social psychology experiment by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel. Commonsense knowledge of actions, social relationships, intentions, and emotions are encoded as defeasible axioms in first-order logic. We identify sets of assumptions that logically entail observed behaviors by backchaining with these axioms to a given depth, and order these sets by their joint probability assuming conditional independence. Our approach solves almost all (91) of the 100 questions in Triangle-COPA, and demonstrates a promising approach to robust behavior interpretation that integrates both logical and probabilistic reasoning",

The practices however have a few shortcomings. QA puts sole emphasis on agents’ organizational compliance aspect whereas C-Sat attempts to measure customers’ satisfaction only based on post dialogue surveys. As a result, outcome of independent QA and C-Sat analysis may not always be in correspondence. Secondly, both processes are retrospective in nature and hence, evidences of bad past dialogues (and consequently bad customer experiences) can only be found after hours or days or weeks depending on their periodicity. Finally, human intensive nature of these practices lead to time and cost overhead while being able to analyze only a small fraction of dialogues. In this paper, we introduce an automatic real-time quality assurance system for contact centers — QART (pronounced cart). QART performs multi-faceted analysis on dialogue utterances, as they happen, using sophisticated statistical and rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It covers various aspects inspired by today’s QA and C-Sat practices as well as introduces novel incremental dialogue summarization capability. QART front-end is an interactive dashboard providing views of ongoing dialogues at different granularity enabling agents’ supervisors to monitor and take corrective actions as needed. We demonstrate effectiveness of different back-end modules as well as the overall system by experimental results on a real-life contact center chat dataset",

For example, an assistant who has learned the subgoal struc- ture of a colleague’s task can more rapidly rec- ognize and support their actions as they unfold. Here we model how humans infer subgoals from observations of complex action sequences using a nonparametric Bayesian model, which assumes that observed actions are generated by approxi- mately rational planning over unknown subgoal sequences. We test this model with a behavioral experiment in which humans observed diﬀerent se- ries of goal-directed actions, and inferred both the number and composition of the subgoal sequences associated with each goal. The Bayesian model predicts human subgoal inferences with high ac- curacy, and signiﬁcantly better than several al- ternative models and straightforward heuristics. Motivated by this result, we simulate how learn- ing and inference of subgoals can improve perfor- mance in an artiﬁcial user assistance task.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a cognitive model of goal formulation in designing that is triggered by surprise. Cognitive system approaches to design synthesis focus on generating alternative designs in response to design goals or requirements. Few existing systems provide models for how goals change during designing, a hallmark of creative design in humans. In this paper we present models of surprise and reformulation as metacognitive processes that transform design goals in order to explore surprising regions of a design search space. The model provides a system with specific goals for exploratory behaviour, whereas previous systems have modelled exploration and novelty-seeking abstractly. We use observed designs to construct a probabilistic model that represents expectations about the design domain, and then reason about the unexpectedness of new designs with that model. We implement our model in the domain of culinary creativity, and demonstrate how the cognitive behaviors of surprise and problem reformulation can be incorporated into design reasoning",

    "title": "Modeling Human Ad Hoc Coordination",
    "abstract": "Whether in groups of humans or groups of computer agents, collaboration is most effective between individuals who have the ability to coordinate on a joint strategy for collective action. However, in general a rational actor will only intend to coordinate if that actor believes the other group members have the same intention. This circular dependence makes rational coordination difficult in uncertain environments if communication between actors is unreliable and no prior agreements have been made. An important normative question with regard to coordination in these ad hoc settings is therefore how one can come to believe that other actors will coordinate, and with regard to systems involving humans, an important empirical question is how humans arrive at these expectations. We introduce an exact algorithm for computing the infinitely recursive hierarchy of graded beliefs required for rational coordination in uncertain environments, and we introduce a novel mechanism for multiagent coordination that uses it. Our algorithm is valid in any environment with a finite state space, and extensions to certain countably infinite state spaces are likely possible. We test our mechanism for multiagent coordination as a model for human decisions in a simple coordination game using existing experimental data. We then explore via simulations whether modeling humans in this way may improve human-agent collaboration",

    "title": "Topic Models to Infer Socio-Economic Maps",
    "abstract": "Socio-economic maps contain important information regarding the population of a country. Computing these maps is critical given that policy makers often times make important decisions based upon such information. However, the compilation of socio-economic maps requires extensive resources and becomes highly expensive. On the other hand, the ubiquitous presence of cell phones, is generating large amounts of spatiotemporal data that can reveal human behavioral traits related to specific socio-economic characteristics. Traditional inference approaches have taken advantage of these datasets to infer regional socio-economic characteristics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach whereby topic models are used to infer socio-economic levels from large-scale spatio-temporal data. Instead of using a pre-determined set of features, we use latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract latent recurring patterns of co-occurring behaviors across regions, which are then used in the prediction of socio-economic levels. We show that our approach improves state of the art prediction results by 9%",

    "abstract": "Transportation and mobility are central to sustainable urban development, where multiagent-based route guidance is widely applied. Traditional multiagent-based route guidance always seeks LET (least expected travel time) paths. However, drivers usually have specific expectations, i.e., tight or loose deadlines, which may not be all met by LET paths. We thus adopt and extend the probability tail model that aims to maximize the probability of reaching destinations before deadlines. Specifically, we propose a decentralized multiagent approach, where infrastructure agents locally collect intentions of concerned vehicle agents and formulate route guidance as a route assignment problem, to guarantee their arrival on time. Experimental results on real road networks justify its ability to increase the chance of arrival on time",

The purpose of this paper is to build a unified learning framework for latent infection state estimation for the hGCHMM, regardless of the infection rate and transition function. We derive our algorithm based on a dynamic auto-encoding variational inference scheme, thus potentially generalizing the hGCHMM to models other than those that work on highly contagious diseases.

    "abstract": "Sensor selection has become an active topic aimed at energy saving, information overload prevention, and communication cost planning in sensor networks. In many real applications, often the sensors' observation regions have overlaps and thus the sensor network is inherently redundant. Therefore it is important to select proper sensors to avoid data redundancy. This paper focuses on how to incrementally select a subset of sensors in a streaming scenario to minimize information redundancy, and meanwhile meet the power consumption constraint. We propose to perform sensor selection in a multi-variate interpolation framework, such that the data sampled by the selected sensors can well predict those of the inactive sensors. Importantly, we incorporate sensors' spatial information as two regularizers, which leads to significantly better prediction performance. We also define a statistical variable to store sufficient information for incremental learning, and introduce a forgetting factor to track sensor streams' evolvement. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, our method is over 10 times faster than the state-of-the-art sensor selection algorithm",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting how influenza propagates is vital to reduce its impact. In this paper we develop a nonparametric model based on Gaussian process (GP) regression to capture the complex spatial and temporal dependencies present in the data. A stochastic variational inference approach was adopted to address scalability. Rather than modeling the problem as a time-series as in many studies, we capture the space-time dependencies by combining different kernels. A kernel averaging technique which converts spatially-diffused point processes to an area process is proposed to model geographical distribution. Additionally, to accurately model the variable behavior of the time-series, the GP kernel is further modified to account for non-stationarity and seasonality. Experimental results on two datasets of state-wide US weekly flu-counts consisting of 19,698 and 89,474 data points, ranging over several years, illustrate the robustness of the model as a tool for further epidemiological investigations",

    "abstract": "In electricity markets, the choice of the right pricing regime is crucial for the utilities because the price they charge to their consumers, in anticipation of their demand in real-time, is a key determinant of their profits and ultimately their survival in competitive energy markets. Among the existing pricing regimes, in this paper, we consider ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes as (i) they help to address the peak demand problem (a crucial problem in smart grids), and (ii) they are transparent and fair to consumers as the cost of electricity can be calculated before the actual consumption. In particular, we propose an axiomatic framework that establishes the conceptual underpinnings of the class of ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes. We first propose five key axioms that reflect the criteria that are vital for energy utilities and their relationship with consumers. We then prove an impossibility theorem to show that there is no pricing regime that satisfies all the five axioms simultaneously. We also study  multiple cost functions arising from various pricing regimes to examine the subset of axioms that they satisfy. We believe that our proposed framework in this paper is first of its kind to evaluate the class of ex-ante dynamic pricing schemes in a manner that can be operationalised by energy utilities",

We investigate if existing AI planning techniques have the potential to improve upon the current solutions. In particular, we propose a light weight but realistic simulator and investigate if an online planning method (UCT) can utilise this simulator to improve the cost-efficiency of pumping station control policies.

State-of-the-art research is focused on either analyzing sensor observations or citizen observations; we seek to exploit both in a synergistic manner. We demonstrate the role of domain knowledge in capturing the non-linearity of speed and travel-time dynamics by segmenting speed and travel-time observations into simpler components amenable to description using linear models such as Linear Dynamical System (LDS).

However, current large-scale environmental participatory sensing campaigns typically do not coordinate the measurements of participants, which can lead to gaps or redundancy in the collected data. While some work has considered this problem, it has made several unrealistic assumptions. In particular, it assumes that complete and accurate knowledge about the participants future movements is available and it does not consider constraints on the number of measurements a user is willing to take. To address these shortcomings, we develop a computationally-efficient coordination algorithm (Best-match) to suggest to users where and when to take measurements. Our algorithm exploits human mobility patterns, but explicitly considers the inherent uncertainty of these patterns.

We consider average winter precipitation over Great Lakes Region in order to identify its dominant influencing factors.Experiments show that global climate indices, computed at different temporal lags, offer predictive information for winter precipitation. Further, among the dominant factors identified using randomized permutation tests, multiple climate indices indicate the influence of geopotential height patterns on winter precipitation.Using composite analysis, we illustrate that certain patterns are indeed typical in high and low precipitation years, and offer plausible scientific reasons for variations in precipitation.Thus, feature selection methods can be useful in identifying influential climate processes and variables, and thereby provide useful hypotheses over physical mechanisms affecting local precipitation",

Poverty data, for example, is typically scarce, sparse in coverage, and labor-intensive to obtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery, on the other hand, is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately, such data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to automatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help direct humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to extract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite imagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce, making it difficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light intensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN model to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning features that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters identifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads, buildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We demonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty mapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected in the field",

To address this shortcoming, we assume that network parameters are only partially known, specified via interval bounds. We then develop a decision making approach that computes the solution with minimax regret. We provide new theoretical results regarding the structure of the minmax regret solution which help develop a computationally efficient approach.

Using the axioms of Shapley value as the conditions for fairness, we show that a stable, fair and budget balanced allocation does not exist in many instances of the game. By relaxing budget balance, we then propose an allocation scheme based on the normalized Shapley value. We show that this scheme maintains stability and fairness while requiring minimum subsidy.

Exponentially-weighted forecast bias estimates and error covariance matrices are formed at observation sites, aggregated spatially and temporally, and used to formulate a constrained, regularized least squares regression problem that may be solved using quadratic programming. The model is re-trained when new observations arrive, updating the forecast bias estimates and consensus combination weights to adapt to weather regime and input forecast model changes. The algorithm is illustrated for 0-72 hour temperature forecasts at over 1200 sites in the contiguous U.S. based on a 22-member forecast ensemble, and its performance over multiple seasons is compared to a state-of-the-art ensemble-based forecasting system.

A critical, though relatively understudied, aspect of effective tutoring is modulating the student's affective state throughout the tutoring session in order to maximize long-term learning gains. We developed an integrated experimental paradigm in which children play a second-language learning game on a tablet, in collaboration with a fully autonomous social robotic learning companion. As part of the system, we measured children's valence and engagement via an automatic facial expression analysis system. These signals were combined into a reward signal that fed into the robot's affective reinforcement learning algorithm. Over several sessions, the robot played the game and personalized its motivational strategies (using verbal and non-verbal actions) to each student. We evaluated this system with 34 children in preschool classrooms for a duration of two months. We saw that (1) children learned new words from the repeated tutoring sessions, (2) the affective policy personalized to students over the duration of the study, and (3) students who interacted with a robot that personalized its affective feedback strategy showed a significant increase in valence, as compared to students who interacted with a non-personalizing robot. This integrated system of tablet-based educational content, affective sensing, affective policy learning, and an autonomous social robot holds great promise for a more comprehensive approach to personalized tutoring",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, which involves the degeneration of various brain functions, resulting in memory loss, cognitive disorder and death. Large amounts of multivariate heterogeneous medical test data are available for the analysis of brain deterioration. How to measure the deterioration remains a challenging problem. In this study, we first investigate how different regions of the human brain change as the patient develops AD. Correlation analysis and feature ranking are performed based on the feature vectors from different stages of the pathologic process in Alzheimer disease. Then, an automatic diagnosis system is presented, which is based on a hybrid manifold learning for feature embedding and the bootstrap aggregating (Bagging) algorithm for classification.We investigate two different tasks, i.e. diagnosis and progression prediction. Extensive comparison is made against Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT) and Random Subspace (RS) methods. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm yields superior results when compared to the other methods, suggesting promising robustness for possible clinical applications",

    "abstract": "We present a domain-independent approach to reference resolution that allows a robotic or virtual agent to resolve references to entities (e.g., objects and locations) found in open worlds when the information needed to resolve such references is distributed among multiple heterogeneous knowledge bases in its architecture. An agent using this approach can combine information from multiple sources without the computational bottleneck associated with centralized knowledge bases. The proposed approach also facilitates “lazy constraint evaluation”, i.e., verifying properties of the referent through different modalities only when the information is needed. After specifying the interfaces by which a reference resolution algorithm can request information from distributed knowledge bases, we present an algorithm for performing open-world reference resolution within that framework, analyze the algorithm’s performance, and demonstrate its behavior on a simulated robot",

    "abstract": "Teaching artificial intelligence is effective if the experience is a visual and interactive one, with educational materials that utilize combinations of various content types such as text, math, and code into an integrated experience. Unfortunately, easy-to-use tools for creating such pedagogical resources are not available to the educators, resulting in most courses being taught using a disconnected set of static materials, which is not only ineffective for learning AI, but further, requires repeated and redundant effort for the instructor. In this paper, we introduce Moro, a software tool for easily creating and presenting AI-friendly teaching materials. Moro notebooks integrate content of different types (text, math, code, images), allow real-time interactions via modifiable and executable code blocks, and are viewable in browsers both as long-form pages and as presentations. Creating notebooks is easy and intuitive; the creation tool is also in-browser, is WYSIWYG for quick iterations of editing, and supports a variety of shortcuts and customizations for efficiency. We present three deployed case studies of Moro that widely differ from each other, demonstrating its utility in a variety of scenarios such as in-class teaching and conference tutorials",

In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to influence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because of their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are rare and tend to focus on the output of the required action; instead, this work focuses on the acceptability of persuasive acts themselves.Building systems able to persuade while being ethically acceptable requires that they be capable of intervening flexibly and of taking decisions about which specific persuasive strategy to use. We show how, exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment of moral dilemmas, we obtain results that will lead to more ethically appropriate systems. Experiments we have conducted address the type of persuader, the strategies adopted and the circumstances. Dimensions surfaced that can characterize the interpersonal differences concerning moral acceptability of machine performed persuasion, usable for strategy adaptation. We also show that the prevailing preconceived negative attitude toward persuasion by a machine is not predictive of actual moral acceptability judgement when subjects are confronted with specific cases",

Thus hybrid collective decision making systems will be in great need. In this scenario, both machines and collective decision making systems should follow some form of moral values and ethical principles (appropriate to where they will act but always aligned to humans'), as well as safety constraints. In fact, humans would accept and trust more machines that behave as ethically as other humans in the same environment. Also, these principles would make it easier for machines to determine their actions and explain their behavior in terms understandable by humans. Moreover, often machines and humans will need to make decisions together, either through consensus or by reaching a compromise.

    "title": "Deploying PAWS to Combat Poaching: Game-Theoretic Patrolling in Areas with Complex Terrain (Demonstration)",
    "abstract": "The conservation of key wildlife species such as tigers and elephants are threatened by poaching activities. In many conservation areas, foot patrols are conducted to prevent poaching but they may not be well-planned to make the best use of the limited patrolling resources. While prior work has introduced PAWS (Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security) as a game-theoretic decision aid to design effective foot patrol strategies to protect wildlife, the patrol routes generated by PAWS may be difficult to follow in areas with complex terrain. Subsequent research has worked on the significant evolution of PAWS, from an emerging application to a regularly deployed software. A key advance of the deployed version of PAWS is that it incorporates the complex terrain information and generates a strategy consisting of easy-to-follow routes. In this demonstration, we provide 1) a video introducing the PAWS system; 2) an interactive visualization of the patrol routes generated by PAWS in an example area with complex terrain; and 3) a machine-human competition in designing patrol strategy given complex terrain and animal distribution",

It is crucial to evaluate the credibility of information and detect the rumors on social media automatically. In this work, we establish a Network Information Credibility Evaluation (NICE) platform, which collects a database of rumors that have been verified on Sina Weibo and automatically evaluates the information generated by users on social media but has not been verified. Users can use a query to search related information. If the according information appears in our database, users can identify it is a rumor immediately. Otherwise, NICE will show users with real-time results crawled automatically from social media and can calculate credibility of a specific result with our algorithm. Our algorithm learns dynamic representations for information on social media based on behavior information, dynamic information, user information and comment information. Then, we use an ordinary logistic regression to classify information into rumors and non-rumors. Based on our algorithm, NICE system achieves satisfactory performance on evaluating information credibility and detecting rumors on social media",

Unfortunately, only a few native applications (provided by the OS developer) are typically voice enabled in devices of today. Since, the utility of a smart device is determined more by the strength of external applications developed for the device, voice enabling non-native applications in a scalable, seamless manner within the device is a critical use case and is the focus of our work. We have developed a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) framework that uses templates supported by the application (as determined by the application developer). This framework can be employed in any mobile OS (Android, iOS, Tizen, Android wear) for a wide range of devices. To aid this demonstration, we have implemented the framework as a service in Android OS. When the user issues a voice command, the natural language query is obtained by this service (using one of local, cloud based or hybrid speech recognizers). The service then executes our NLU framework to identify the relevant application and particular action details. In this demonstration, we will showcase this NLU framework implemented as an Android service on a set of applications that will be installed on the fly. Specifically, we will show how the voice queries are understood and necessary services are launched on android smart wearables and phones",

The presence of certain species of insects, especially storage beetles, is a reliable indicator of  possible contamination during storage and food processing. However, the current approach of identifying species by visual examination of insect fragments is rather subjective and time-consuming. To aid this inspection process, we have developed in collaboration with FDA food analysts some image analysis-based machine intelligence to achieve species identification with up to 90% accuracy. The current project is a continuation of this development effort. Here we present an image analysis environment that allows practical deployment of the machine intelligence on computers with limited processing power and memory. Using this environment, users can prepare input sets by selecting images for analysis, and inspect these images through the integrated panning and zooming capabilities. After species analysis, the results panel allows the user to compare the analyzed images with reference images of the proposed species. Further additions to this environment should include a log of previously analyzed images, and eventually extend to interaction with a central cloud repository of images through a web-based interface",

    "title": "Artificial Intelligence for Predictive and Evidence Based Architecture Design",
    "abstract": "The evidence-based analysis of people's navigation and wayfinding behaviour in large-scale built-up environments (e.g., hospitals, airports) encompasses the measurement and qualitative analysis of a range of aspects including people's visual perception in new and familiar surroundings, their decision-making procedures and intentions, the affordances of the environment itself, etc. In our research on large-scale evidence-based qualitative analysis of wayfinding behaviour, we construe visual perception and navigation in built-up environments as a dynamic narrative construction process of movement and exploration driven by situation-dependent goals, guided by visual aids such as signage and landmarks, and influenced by environmental (e.g., presence of other people, time of day, lighting) and personal (e.g., age, physical attributes) factors. We employ a range of sensors for measuring the embodied visuo-locomotive experience of building users: eye-tracking, egocentric gaze analysis, external camera based visual analysis to interpret fine-grained behaviour (e.g., stopping, looking around, interacting with other people), and also manual observations made by human experimenters. Observations are processed, analysed, and integrated in a holistic model of the visuo-locomotive narrative experience at the individual and group level. Our model also combines embodied visual perception analysis with analysis of the structure and layout of the environment (e.g., topology, routes, isovists) computed from available 3D models of the building. In this framework, abstract regions like the visibility space, regions of attention, eye movement clusters, are treated as first class visuo-spatial and iconic objects that can be used for interpreting the visual experience of subjects in a high-level qualitative manner. The final integrated analysis of the wayfinding experience is such that it can even be presented in a virtual reality environment thereby providing an immersive experience (e.g., using tools such as the Oculus Rift) of the qualitative analysis for single participants, as well as for a combined analysis of large group. This capability is especially important for experiments in post-occupancy analysis of building performance. Our construction of indoor wayfinding experience as a form of moving image analysis centralizes the role and influence of perceptual visuo-spatial characteristics and morphological features of the built environment into the discourse on wayfinding research. We will demonstrate the impact of this work with several case-studies, particularly focussing on a large-scale experiment conducted at the New Parkland Hospital in Dallas Texas, USA",

The research of my PhD thesis focuses on image emotion computing (IEC), which aims to predict the emotion perceptions of given images. The development of IEC is greatly constrained by two main challenges: affective gap and subjective evaluation. Previous works mainly focused on finding features that can express emotions better to bridge the affective gap, such as elements-of-art based features and shape features. According to the emotion representation models, including categorical emotion states (CES) and dimensional emotion space (DES), three different tasks are traditionally performed on IEC:  affective image classification, regression and retrieval. The state-of-the-art methods on the three above tasks are image-centric, focusing on the dominant emotions for the majority of viewers. For my PhD thesis, I plan to answer the following questions: (1) Compared to the low-level elements-of-art based features, can we find some higher level features that are more interpretable and have stronger link to emotions? (2) Are the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image subjective and different? If they are, how can we tackle the user-centric emotion prediction? (3) For image-centric emotion computing, can we predict the emotion distribution instead of the dominant emotion category?",

When multiple entities start distributing content, information can reach unintended individuals and inference can reveal more information about the user. Existing applications do not focus on detecting privacy violations before they occur in the system. This thesis proposes an agent-based representation of a social network, where the agents manage users' privacy requirements and create privacy agreements with agents. The privacy context, such as the relations among users, various content types in the system, and so on are represented with a formal language. By reasoning with this formal language, an agent checks the current state of the system to resolve privacy violations before they occur. We argue that commonsense reasoning could be useful to solve some of privacy examples reported in the literature. We will develop new methods to automatically identify private information using commonsense reasoning, which has never been applied to privacy context. Moreover, agents may have conflicting privacy requirements. We will study how to use agreement technologies in privacy settings for agents to resolve conflicts automatically",

    "title": "Apprenticeship Scheduling for Human-Robot Teams",
    "abstract": "Resource optimization and scheduling is a costly, challenging problem that affects almost every aspect of our lives. One example that affects each of us is health care: Poor systems design and scheduling of resources can lead to higher rates of patient noncompliance and burnout of health care providers, as highlighted by the Institute of Medicine (Brandenburg et al. 2015). In aerospace manufacturing, every minute re-scheduling in response to dynamic disruptions in the build process of a Boeing 747 can cost up to $100.000. The military is also highly invested in the effective use of resources. In missile defense, for example, operators must =solve a challenging weapon-to-target problem, balancing the cost of expendable, defensive weapons while hedging against uncertainty in adversaries’ tactics. Researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) planning and scheduling strive to develop algorithms to improve resource allocation. However, there are two primary challenges. First, optimal task allocation and sequencing with upper and lower-bound temporal constraints (i.e., deadlines and wait constraints) is NP-Hard (Bertsimas and Weismantel 2005). Approximation techniques for scheduling exist and typically rely on the algorithm designer crafting heuristics based on domain expertise to decompose or structure the scheduling problem and prioritize the manner in which resources are allocated and tasks are sequenced (Tang and Parker 2005; Jones, Dias, and Stentz 2011). The second problem is this aforementioned reliance on crafting clever heuristics based on domain knowledge. Manually capturing domain knowledge within a scheduling algorithm remains a challenging process and leaves much to be desired (Ryan et al. 2013). The aim of my thesis is to develop an autonomous system that 1) learns the heuristics and implicit rules-of-thumb developed by domain experts from years of experience, 2) embeds and leverages this knowledge within a scalable resource optimization framework, and 3) provides decision support in a way that engages users and benefits them in their decision-making process. By intelligently leveraging the ability of humans to learn heuristics and the speed of modern computation, we can improve the ability to coordinate resources in these time and safety-critical domains",

    "abstract": "In many real-world domains, the presence of machines is becoming more ubiquitous to the point that they are usually more than simple automation tools. As part of the environment amongst human users, it is necessary for these computers and robots to be able to interact with them reasonably by either working independently around them or participating in a task, especially one with which a person needs help. This interactive procedure requires several steps: recognizing the user and environment from sensor data, interpreting the user’s activity and motives, determining a responsive behavior, performing the behavior, and then recognizing everything again to confirm the behavior choice and replan if necessary. At the moment, the research areas addressing these steps, activity recognition, plan recognition, intent recognition, and planning, have all been primarily studied independently. However, pipelining each independent process can be risky in real-time situations where there may be enough time to only run a few steps. This leads to a critical question: how do we perform everything under time constraints? In this thesis summary, I propose a framework that integrates these processes by taking advantage of features shared between them",

In partially observable multiagent domains, agents much share information regarding aspects of the environment such that uncertainty is reduced across the team, permitting better coordination. Similarly, we consider how communication may be utilized within ad hoc teams to resolve behavioral uncertainty. Transmitting intentional messages allows agents to adjust predictions of a teammate's individual course of action. In short, an ad hoc agent coordinating with an unknown teammate can identify uncertainties within its own predictive model of teammate behavior then request the appropriate policy information, allowing the agent to adapt its personal plan. The main contribution of this work is the characterization of the interaction between learning, communication, and planning in ad hoc teams",

Therefore, several lifted inference algorithms that exploit relational structure and operate at the compact first-order level, have been developed in recent years. However, the focus of much of existing research on lifted inference is on marginal inference while algorithms for MAP and marginal MAP inference are far less advanced.

    "title": "Direct Discriminative Bag Mapping for Multi-Instance Learning",
    "abstract": "Multi-instance learning (MIL) is useful for tackling labeling ambiguity in learning tasks, by allowing a bag of instances to share one label. Recently, bag mapping methods, which transform a bag to a single instance in a new space via instance selection, have drawn significant attentions. To date, most existing works are developed based on the original space, i.e., utilizing all instances for bag mapping, and instance selection is indirectly tied to the MIL objective.

In this paper, we propose a direct discriminative mapping approach for multi-instance learning (MILDM), which identifies instances to directly distinguish bags in the new mapping space.

Many existing methods reduce LP to binary classification. However, the dominance of absent links in real world networks makes misclassification error a poor performance metric. Instead, researchers have argued for using ranking performance measures, like AUC, AP and NDCG, for evaluation. We recast the LP problem as a learning to rank problem and use effective learning to rank techniques directly during training which allows us to deal with the class imbalance problem systematically. As a demonstration of our general approach, we develop an LP method by optimizing the cross-entropy surrogate, originally used in the popular ListNet ranking algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available co-authorship, citation and metabolic networks to demonstrate the merits of our method",

The challenge in utilizing such data is how to robustly extract people's trip sequences from sparse and noisy cell phone data and endow the extracted trips with semantic meaning, i.e., trip purposes.In this study we reconstruct trip sequences from sparse cell phone records. Next we propose a Bayesian trip purpose classification method and compare it to a Markov random field based trip purpose clustering method, representing scenarios with and without labeled training data respectively. This procedure shows how the cell phone data, despite their coarse granularity and sparsity, can be turned into a low cost, long term, and ubiquitous sensor network for mobility related services",

Then we can obtain two kinds of similarities, one is between question and the candidate answer, and the other one is between support answers and the candidate answer.

The second order optimization methods, such as quasi-Newton methods, were proposed to deal with this problem. However, the non-convexity results in many obstructions for training RBM, including the infeasibility of applying second order optimization methods. In order to overcome this obstruction, we introduce an em-like iterative project quasi-Newton (IPQN) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively perform the sampling procedure where it is not necessary to update parameters, and the sub-training procedure that is convex. In sub-training procedures, we apply quasi-Newton methods to deal with the pathological problem. We further show that Newton's method turns out to be a good approximation of the natural gradient (NG) method in RBM training. We evaluate IPQN in a series of density estimation experiments on the artificial dataset and the MNIST digit dataset.

    "abstract": "Empirical evaluations of DCOP algorithms are typically done in simulation and under the assumption that the communication times between all pairs of agents are identical, which is unrealistic in many real-world applications. In this abstract, we incorporate non-uniform communication times in the default DCOP model and propose heuristics that exploit these communication times to speed up DCOP algorithms that operate on pseudo-trees",

    "abstract": "In impromptu or ad hoc settings, participating players are precluded from precoordination. Subsequently, each player's own model is private and includes some uncertainty about the others' types or behaviors. Harsanyi's formulation of a Bayesian game lays emphasis on this uncertainty while the players each play exactly one turn. We propose a new game-theoretic framework where Bayesian players engage in a Markov game and each has private but imperfect information regarding other players' types. Consequently, we construct player types whose structure is explicit and includes a finite level belief hierarchy instead of utilizing Harsanyi's abstract types and a common prior distribution. We formalize this new framework and demonstrate its effectiveness on two standard ad hoc teamwork domains involving two or more ad hoc players",

However, modeling many realistic interactions between agents results in games that are extremely large. In these cases computing standard solutions like Nash equilibrium may be intractable. To overcome this issue the idea of abstraction has been investigated, most prominently in research on computer Poker. Solving a game using abstraction requires using some method to simplify the game before it is analyzed. We study a new variation for solving normal form games using abstraction that is based on finding and solving suitable sub games. We compare this method with several variations of a common type of abstraction based on clustering similar strategies",

    "abstract": "Stackelberg Security Games (SSG) have been widely applied for solving real-world security problems—with a significant research emphasis on modeling attackers’ behaviors to handle their bounded rationality. However, access to real-world data (used for learning an accurate behavioral model) is often limited, leading to uncertainty in attacker’s behaviors while modeling. This paper therefore focuses on addressing behavioral uncertainty in SSG with the following main contributions: 1) we present a new uncertainty game model that integrates uncertainty intervals into a behavioral model to capture behavioral uncertainty; 2) based on this game model, we propose a novel robust algorithm that approximately computes the defender’s optimal strategy in the worst-case scenario of uncertainty—with a bound guarantee on its solution quality",

    "abstract": "Trust and cooperation are fundamental to human interactions.  How much we trust other people directly influences the decisions we make and our willingness to cooperate. It thus seems natural that trust be equally important in successful human-robot interaction (HRI), since how much a human trusts a robot affects how they might interact with it.  We propose using a coin entrustment game, a variant of prisoner’s dilemma, to measure trust and cooperation as separate phenomenon between human and robot agents. With this game, we test the following hypotheses: (1) Humans will achieve and maintain higher levels of trust when interacting with what they believe to be a robot than with another human; and (2) humans will cooperate more readily with robots and will maintain a higher level of cooperation. This work contributes an experimental paradigm that uses the coin entrustment game as a way to test our hypotheses. Our empirical analysis shows that humans tend to trust robots to a greater degree than other humans, while cooperating equally well in both",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge in temporal planning is robustly dealing with non-determinism introduced by the environment, e.g., the durational uncertainty of an action taken by a robot in the physical world due to slippage or other unexpected influences. Recent advances show that robustness, which accounts for uncertainty in predicting schedule success, is a better measure of solution quality than traditional metrics such as flexibility. This paper introduces the Robust Execution Problem (REP) for finding maximally robust dispatch strategies for general probabilistic temporal planning problems. While the REP is generally intractable in practice, we introduce approximate solution techniques—one that can be computed statically prior to the start of execution while providing robustness guarantees and one that dynamically adjusts to opportunities and setbacks during execution. We show empirically that dynamically optimizing for robustness improves the likelihood of execution success",
