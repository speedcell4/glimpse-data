    "title": "Interdependent Scheduling Games",
    "abstract": "We propose a model of interdependent scheduling games in which each player controls a set of services that they schedule independently. A player is free to schedule his own services at any time; however, each of these services only begins to accrue reward for the player when all predecessor services, which may or may not be controlled by the same player, have been activated. This model, where players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced in planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring electricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical care in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of staff, equipment, and medicine. We undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this setting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization, computing best responses, Nash dynamics, and existence and computation of Nash equilibria",

    "abstract": "Synergistic interactions between task/resource allocation and stochastic planning exist in many environments such as transportation and logistics, UAV task assignment and disaster rescue. Existing research in exploiting these synergistic interactions between the two problems have either only considered domains where tasks/resources are completely independent of each other or have focussed on approaches with limited scalability. In this paper, we address these two limitations by introducing a generic model for task/resource constrained multi-agent stochastic planning, referred to as TasC-MDPs. We provide two scalable greedy algorithms, one of which provides posterior quality guarantees. Finally, we illustrate the high scalability and solution performance of our approaches in comparison with existing work on two benchmark problems from the literature",

We extend previous work on verification of multi-agent systems where actions of agents produce and consume resources, by adding epistemic pre- and postconditions to actions. This allows us to model scenarios where agents perform both actions which change the world, and actions which change their knowledge about the world, such as observation and communication. To avoid logical omniscience and obtain a compact model of the system, our model of agents' knowledge is syntactic. We define a class of coalition-uniform strategies with respect to any (decidable) notion of coalition knowledge.

    "abstract": "We study a fair division problem with indivisible items, namely the computation of maximin share allocations. Given a set of n players, the maximin share of a single player is the best she can guarantee to herself, if she would partition the items in any way she prefers, into n bundles, and then receive her least desirable bundle. The objective then is to find an allocation, so that each player is guaranteed her maximin share. Previous works have studied this problem purely algorithmically, providing constant factor approximation algorithms. In this work, we embark on a mechanism design approach and investigate the existence of truthful mechanisms. We propose three models regarding the information that the mechanism attempts to elicit from the players, based on the cardinal and ordinal representation of preferences. We establish positive and negative (impossibility) results for each model and highlight the limitations imposed by truthfulness on the approximability of the problem.

    "title": "Randomized Social Choice Functions under Metric Preferences",
    "abstract": "We determine the quality of randomized social choice mechanisms in a setting in which the agents have metric preferences: every agent has a cost for each alternative, and these costs form a metric. We assume that these costs are unknown to the mechanisms (and possibly even to the agents themselves), which means we cannot simply select the optimal alternative, i.e. the alternative that minimizes the total agent cost (or median agent cost). However, we do assume that the agents know their ordinal preferences that are induced by the metric space. We examine randomized social choice functions that require only this ordinal information and select an alternative that is good in expectation with respect to the costs from the metric. To quantify how good a randomized social choice function is, we bound the distortion, which is the worst-case ratio between expected cost of the alternative selected and the cost of the optimal alternative. We provide new distortion bounds for a variety of randomized mechanisms, for both general metrics and for important special cases. Our results show a sizable improvement in distortion over deterministic mechanisms",

    "abstract": "Recently, much attention has been devoted to discrete preference games to model the formation of opinions in social networks. More specifically, these games model the agents' strategic decision of expressing publicly an opinion, which is a result of an interplay between the agent's private belief and the social pressure. However, these games have very limited expressive power; they can model only very simple social relations and they assume that all the agents respond to social pressure in the same way. In this paper, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games. These games have additional characteristics that can model social relations to allies or competitors and complex relations among more than two agents. Moreover, they introduce different levels of strength for each relation, and they personalize the dependence of each agent to her neighborhood",

For each of them, we consider the corresponding Pareto optimality notion, and we study the complexity of computing and verifying Pareto optimal outcomes.

In such games, each agent has a weight, and a coalition of agents wins the game if the sum of the weights of its members exceeds a certain quota. The Shapley value is used as an index for the true power held by the agents in such games. Earlier work has studied the implications of setting the value of the quota on the agents' power under the assumption that the game is given with a fixed set of agent weights. We focus on a model where the agent weights originate from a stochastic process, resulting in weight uncertainty. We analyze the expected effect of the quota on voting power given the weight generating process. We examine two extreme cases of the balls and bins model: uniform and exponentially decaying probabilities. We show that the choice of a quota may have a large influence on the power disparity of the agents, even when the governing distribution is likely to result in highly similar weights for the agents.

Most existing algorithms for game theoretic computation, from computing expected utilities and best responses to finding Nash equilibrium and other solution concepts, all involve enumeration of pure strategies. As a result, such algorithms would take exponential time on these congestion games. In this work, we study congestion games in which each player's strategy space can be described compactly using a set of linear constraints. For instance, network congestion games naturally fall into this subclass as each player's strategy can be described by a set of flow constraints. We show that we can represent any mixed strategy compactly using marginals which specify the probability of using each resource. As a consequence, the expected utilities and the best responses can be computed in polynomial time. We reduce the problem of computing a best/worst symmetric approximate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in symmetric congestion games to a constraint optimization problem on a graph formed by the resources and the strategy constraints. As a result, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this problem when the graph has bounded tree width",

The traditional computational question, that asks to compute a draw (optimal draw) that maximizes the winning probability for a distinguished player, has received a lot of attention. Previous works consider the problem where the pairwise winning probabilities are known precisely, while we study how robust is the winning probability with respect to small errors in the pairwise winning probabilities. First, we present several illuminating examples to establish: (a) there exist deterministic tournaments (where the pairwise winning probabilities are 0 or 1) where one optimal draw is much more robust than the other; and (b) in general, there exist tournaments with slightly suboptimal draws that are more robust than all the optimal draws. The above examples motivate the study of the computational problem of robust draws that guarantee a specified winning probability. Second, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the robustness of a draw for sufficiently small errors in pairwise winning probabilities, and obtain that the stated computational problem is NP-complete. We also show that two natural cases of deterministic tournaments where the optimal draw could be computed in polynomial time also admit polynomial-time algorithms to compute robust optimal draws",

    "title": "Better Strategyproof Mechanisms without Payments or Prior — An Analytic Approach",
    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of designing strategyproof mechanisms for allocating divisible items among two agents who have linear utilities, where payments are disallowed and there is no prior information on the agents' preferences. The objective is to design strategyproof mechanisms which are competitive against the most efficient (but not strategyproof) mechanism. For the case with two items: We provide a set of sufficient conditions for strategyproofness. We use an analytic approach to derive strategyproof mechanisms which are more competitive than all prior strategyproof mechanisms. We improve the linear-program-based proof of Guo and Conitzer to show new upper bounds on competitive ratios. We provide the first compact proof on upper bound of competitiveness. For the cases with any number of items, we build on the Partial Allocation mechanisms introduced by Cole et al. to design a strategyproof mechanism which is 0.67776-competitive, breaking the 2/3 barrier. We also propose a new sub-class of strategyproof mechanisms for any numbers of agents and items, which we call it Dynamic-Increasing-Price mechanisms, where each agent purchases the items using virtual money, and the prices of the items depend on other agents' preferences",

    "title": "Approximating Value Equivalence in Interactive Dynamic Influence Diagrams Using Behavioral Coverage",
    "abstract": "Interactive dynamic influence diagrams~(I-DIDs) provide an explicit way of modeling how a subject agent solves decision making problems in the presence of other agents in a common setting. To optimize its decisions, the subject agent needs to predict the other agents' behavior, that is generally obtained by solving their candidate models. This becomes extremely difficult since the model space may be rather large, and grows when the other agents act and observe over the time. A recent proposal for solving I-DIDs lies in a concept of value equivalence (VE) that shows potential advances on significantly reducing the model space. In this paper, we establish a principled framework to implement the VE techniques and propose an approximate method to compute VE of candidate models. The development offers ample opportunity of exploiting VE to further improve the scalability of I-DID solutions. We theoretically analyze properties of the approximate techniques and show empirical results in multiple problem domains",

Prior works on preference elicitation focus on unrestricted domain and the domain of single peaked preferences and show that the preferences in single peaked domain can be elicited by much less number of queries compared to unrestricted domain. We extend this line of research and study preference elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset of the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity crucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the distance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other natural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any direct role in determining query complexity. We then investigate the query complexity for finding a weak Condorcet winner for preferences single peaked on a tree and show that this task has much less query complexity than preference elicitation. Here again we observe that the number of leaves in the underlying single peaked tree and the path cover number of the tree influence the query complexity of the problem",

    "title": "Complexity of Manipulation with Partial Information in Voting",
    "abstract": "The Coalitional Manipulation problem has been studied extensively in the literature for many voting rules. However, most studies have focused on the complete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most real-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate knowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter. In this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator). For many of them, the corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be computationally intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very little information is missing, or in other words, even when the instances are quite close to the complete information setting. Our overall conclusion is that computational hardness continues to be a valid obstruction to manipulation, in the context of a more realistic model",

Standard exchange models, such as house allocation and kidney exchange cannot be applied to an emerging industrial application, coined digital good exchange, where an agent still possesses her initial endowment after exchanging with others. However, her valuation toward her endowment decreases as it is possessed by more agents. We put forward game theoretical models tailored for digital good exchange. In the first part of the paper, we first consider a natural class of games where agents can choose either a subset of other participants' items or no participation at all. It turns out that this class of games can be modeled as a variant of congestion games. We prove that it is in general NP-complete to determine whether there exists a non-trivial pure Nash equilibrium where at least some agent chooses a nonempty subset of items. However, we show that in a subset of games for single-minded agents with unit demand, there exist non-trivial Pure Nash equilibria and put forward an efficient algorithm to find such equilibria. In the second part of the paper, we investigate digital good exchange from a mechanism design perspective. We ask if there is a truthful mechanism in this setting that can achieve good social welfare guarantee. To this end, we design a randomized fixed-price-exchange mechanism that is individually rational and truthful, and for two-player case yields a tight log-approximation with respect to any individually rational allocation",

We develop novel allocation and payment mechanisms which truthfully elicit the EV owners' preferences and constraints, including arrival, departure, required charge, as well as the costs of discharging due to loss of efficiency of the battery. The car park will schedule the charging and discharging of each EV, ensuring the constraints of the EVs are met, and taking into consideration predictions about future electricity prices. Optimally solving the global problem is intractable, and we present three novel heuristic online scheduling algorithms.

    "abstract": "We consider a nonatomic selfish routing model with independent stochastic travel times for each edge, represented by mean and variance latency functions that depend on arc flows. This model can apply to traffic in the Internet or in a road network. Variability negatively impacts packets or drivers, by introducing jitter in transmission delays which lowers quality of streaming audio or video, or by making it more difficult to predict the arrival time at destination. The price of risk aversion (PRA) has been defined as the worst-case ratio of the cost of an equilibrium with risk-averse players who seek risk-minimizing paths, and that of an equilibrium with risk-neutral users who minimize the mean travel time of a path [Nikolova and Stier-Moses, 2015]. This inefficiency metric captures the degradation of system performance caused by variability and risk aversion. In this paper, we provide the first lower bounds on the PRA. First, we show a family of structural lower bounds, which grow linearly with the size of the graph and players' risk-aversion. They are tight for graph sizes that are powers of two. We also provide asymptotically tight functional bounds that depend on the allowed latency functions but not on the topology. The functional bounds match the price-of-anarchy bounds for congestion games multiplied by an extra factor that accounts for risk aversion. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula of the PRA for a family of graphs that generalize series-parallel graphs and the Braess graph. This formula also applies to the mean-standard deviation user objective a much more complex model of risk-aversion due to the cost of a path being non-additive over edge costs",

In contrast, we consider norm emergence in an open system, where membership can change, and where no predetermined graph structure exists. We propose Silk, a mechanism wherein a generator monitors interactions among member agents and recommends norms to help resolve conflicts. Each member decides on whether to accept or reject a recommended norm. Upon exiting the system, a member passes its experience along to incoming members of the same type. Thus, members develop norms in a hybrid manner to resolve conflicts. We evaluate Silk via simulation in the traffic domain.

    "title": "Incentivizing Intelligent Customer Behavior in Smart-Grids: A Risk-Sharing Tariff & Optimal Strategies",
    "abstract": "Current electricity tariffs for retail rarely provide incentives for intelligent demand response of flexible customers. Such customers could otherwise contribute to balancing supply and demand in future smart grids. This paper proposes an innovative risk-sharing tariff to incentivize intelligent customer behavior. A two-step parameterized payment scheme is proposed, consisting of a prepayment based on the expected consumption, and a supplementary payment for any observed deviation from the anticipated consumption. Within a game-theoretical analysis, we capture the strategic conflict of interest between a retailer and a customer in a two-player game, and we present optimal, i.e., best response, strategies for both players in this game. We show analytically that the proposed tariff provides customers of varying flexibility with variable incentives to assume and alleviate a fraction of the balancing risk, contributing in this way to the uncertainty reduction in the envisioned smart-grid",

    "title": "Dynamic Auctions with Bank Accounts",
    "abstract": "Consider a buyer with independent additive valuations for a set of goods, and a seller who is constrained to sell one item at a time in an online fashion. If the seller is constrained to run independent auctions for each item, then he would run Myerson's optimal auction for each item. If the seller is allowed to use the full power of dynamic mechanism design and have the auction for each item depend on the outcome of the previous auctions, he is able to perform much better. The main issues in implementing such strategies in online settings where items arrive over time are that the auction might be too complicated or it makes too strong assumptions on the buyer's rationality or seller's commitment over time. This motivates us to explore a restricted family of dynamic auctions that can be implemented in an online fashion and without too much commitment from the seller ahead of time. In particular, we study a set of auction in which the space of single-shot auctions is augmented with a structure that we call bank account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. This structure allows the seller to store deficits or surpluses of buyer utility from each individual auction and even them out on the long run. This is akin to enforcing individual rationality constraint on average rather than per auction. We also study the effect of enforcing a maximum limit to the values that bank account might grow, which means that we enforce that besides the auction being individually rational on average it is also not far from being individually rational at any given interval. Interestingly, even with these restrictions, we can achieve significantly better revenue and social welfare compared to separate Myerson auctions",

    "abstract": "Plan Recognition algorithms require to recognize a complete hierarchy explaining the agent's actions and goals. While the output of such algorithms is informative to the recognizer, the cost of its calculation is high in run-time, space, and completeness. Moreover, performing plan recognition online requires the observing agent to reason about future actions that have not yet been seen and maintain a set of hypotheses to support all possible options. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for online plan recognition called SLIM (Semi-Lazy Inference Mechanism). It combines both a bottom-up and top-down parsing processes, which allow it to commit only to the minimum necessary actions in real-time, but still provide complete hypotheses post factum. We show both theoretically and empirically that although the computational cost of this process is still exponential, there is a significant improvement in run-time when compared to a state of the art of plan recognition algorithm",

    "title": "Sequential Plan Recognition",
    "abstract": "Plan recognition algorithms infer agents' plans from their observed actions. Due to imperfect knowledge about the agent's behavior and the environment, it is often the case that there are multiple hypotheses about an agent's plans that are consistent with the observations, though only one of these hypotheses is correct. This paper addresses the problem of how to disambiguate between hypotheses, by querying the acting agent about whether a candidate plan in one of the hypotheses matches its intentions. This process is performed sequentially and used to update the set of possible hypotheses during the recognition process. The paper defines the sequential plan recognition process (SPRP), which seeks to reduce the number of hypotheses using a minimal number of queries. We propose a number of policies for the SPRP which use maximum likelihood and information gain to choose which plan to query. We show this approach works well in practice on two domains from the literature, significantly reducing the number of hypotheses using fewer queries than a baseline approach. Our results can inform the design of future plan recognition systems that interleave the recognition process with intelligent interventions of their users",

Multiple aspects should be taken into account for this, such as agents' skills and constraints posed by existing assignments. In this paper, we focus on another aspect: when the agents are self-interested, careful role assignment is necessary to make cooperative behavior an equilibrium of the repeated game. We formalize this problem and provide an easy-to-check necessary and sufficient condition for a given role assignment to induce cooperation. However, we show that finding whether such a role assignment exists is in general NP-hard. Nevertheless, we give two algorithms for solving the problem. The first is based on a mixed-integer linear program formulation. The second is based on a dynamic program, and runs in pseudopolynomial time if the number of agents is constant. Minor modifications of these algorithms also allow for determination of the minimal subsidy necessary to induce cooperation. In our experiments, the IP performs much, much faster",

    "title": "Core-Selecting Payment Rules for Combinatorial Auctions with Uncertain Availability of Goods",
    "abstract": "In some auction domains, there is uncertainty regarding the final availability of the goods being auctioned off. For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are execution-contingent, i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules",

In this paper, we analyze TH equilibria of Plurality voting. We provide an efficient algorithm for computing a TH best response and establish many useful properties of TH equilibria in Plurality voting games.

We propose Generalized DBA (GDBA) to span the 24 combinations in the three dimensions. In our theoretical analysis we prove that some variants of GDBA are equivalent for certain problems, and prove that other variants may find suboptimal solutions even on tree topologies where DBA is complete.

Meanwhile, such systems can substantially decrease private car ownership and use, and thus significantly reduce traffic congestion, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. To achieve this objective, an AMoD system requires private information about the demand from passengers. However, due to self-interestedness, passengers are unlikely to cooperate with the service providers in this regard. Therefore, an online mechanism is desirable if it incentivizes passengers to truthfully report their actual demand. For the purpose of promoting ridesharing, we hereby introduce a posted-price, integrated online ridesharing mechanism (IORS) that satisfies desirable properties such as ex-post incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget-balance.

These games capture the idea of coordination in the absence of globally common strategies. Prior work shows that the problem of determining the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for these games is NP-complete already for graphs with all weights equal to one and no bonuses. However, for several classes of graphs (e.g. DAGs and cliques) pure Nash equilibria or even strong equilibria always exist and can be found by simply following a particular improvement or coalition-improvement path, respectively. In this paper we identify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or coalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a consequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in polynomial time. We also argue that these results are optimal in the sense that in natural generalisations of these classes of graphs, a pure Nash equilibrium may not even exist",

In each iteration of the search in such algorithms, every agent selects a group of agents that comply with some selection criteria (each algorithm specifies different criteria).

A contest between mediators of adjacent groups determines which groups will replace their assignments in that iteration to the found optimal ones. In this work we present a framework called RODA (Region-Optimal DCOP Algorithm) that encompasses the algorithms in the region-optimality family, and in particular any method for selecting groups. We devise a secure implementation of RODA, called PRODA, which preserves constraint privacy and partial decision privacy.

In contrast, the problem of how election control can be prevented or deterred has been largely ignored. We introduce the problem of optimal protection against election control, where manipulation is allowed at the granularity of groups of voters (e.g., voting locations), through a denial-of-service attack, and the defender allocates limited protection resources to prevent control. We show that for plurality voting, election control through group deletion to prevent a candidate from winning is in P, while it is NP-Hard to prevent such control. We then present a double-oracle framework for computing an optimal prevention strategy, developing exact mixed-integer linear programming for mulations for both the defender and attacker oracles (both of these subproblems we show to be NP-Hard), as well as heuristic oracles.

An individual agent's decision-making problem is modeled by the standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation.

We refer to these upper bound constraints as \"safety\" constraints. If agents follow unconstrained policies (policies that do not impose the safety constraints), the safety constraints might be violated. In this paper, we devise algorithms that provide safe decision-making policies. The set of safe decision policies can be shown to be convex, and hence the policy synthesis is tractable via reliable and fast Interior Point Method (IPM) algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms first using a simple MDP, and then using a dynamic traffic assignment problem.

Recently, Programming by Optimization (PbO) has been proposed as an alternative design paradigm in which algorithmic choices are left open by design and algorithm configuration methods (e.g. ParamILS) are used to automatically generate the best algorithm for a specific use-case. We argue that, while powerful, contemporary configurators limit themselves by abstracting information that can otherwise be exploited to speed up the optimization process as well as improve the quality of the resulting design. In this work, we propose an alternative white box approach, reformulating the algorithm design problem as a Markov Decision Process, capturing the intrinsic relationships between design decisions and their respective contribution to overall algorithm performance. Subsequently, we discuss and illustrate the benefits of this formulation experimentally",

    "abstract": "Many combinatorial problems are solved with a Depth-First search (DFS) guided by a heuristic and it is well-known that this method is very fragile with respect to heuristic mistakes. One standard way to make DFS more robust is to search by increasing number of discrepancies. This approach has been found useful in several domains where the search structure is a height-bounded OR tree. In this paper we investigate the generalization of discrepancy-based search to AND/OR search trees and propose an extension of the Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) algorithm. We demonstrate the relevance of our proposal in the context of Graphical Models. In these problems, which can be solved with either a standard OR search tree or an AND/OR tree, we show the superiority of our approach. For a fixed number of discrepancies, the search space visited by the AND/OR algorithm strictly contains the search space visited by standard LDS, and many more nodes can be visited due to the multiplicative effect of the AND/OR decomposition. Besides, if the AND/OR tree achieves a significant size reduction with respect to the standard OR tree, the cost of each iteration of the AND/OR algorithm is asymptotically lower than in standard LDS. We report experiments on the minsum problem on different domains and show that the AND/OR version of LDS usually obtains better solutions given the same CPU time",

    "abstract": "Recently, MRFs with two-dimensional (2D) labels have proved useful to many applications, such as image matching and optical flow estimation. Due to the huge 2D label set in these problems, existing optimization algorithms tend to be slow for the inference of 2D label MRFs, and this greatly limits the practical use of 2D label MRFs. To solve the problem, this paper presents an efficient algorithm, named FastLCD. Unlike previous popular move-making algorithms (e.g., α-expansion) that visit all the labels exhaustively in each step, FastLCD optimizes the 2D label MRFs by performing label coordinate descents alternately in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, and by this way, it does not need to visit all the labels exhaustively. FastLCD greatly reduces the search space of the label set and benefits from a lower time complexity. Experimental results show that FastLCD is much faster, while it still yields high quality results",

We consider two special cases of the MarkovSLS algorithm: SoftSLS and AdaptiveSLS. In SoftSLS, the probability parameters are fixed, enabling analysis using standard homogeneous Markov chains. We study the interaction between the restart and noise parameters in SoftSLS, and optimize them analytically in addition to the traditional empirical approach. Experimentally, we investigate the dependency of SoftSLS's performance on its noise and restart parameters, validating the analytical results. AdaptiveSLS dynamically adjusts its noise and restart parameters during search. Experimentally, on synthetic and feature selection problems, we compare AdaptiveSLS with other algorithms including an analytically optimized version of SoftSLS, and find that it performs well while not requiring prior knowledge of the search space",

Most existing approaches performing the two steps separately are of a heuristic nature and produce results of varying quality. Instead, we address the problem of finding an optimal constrained conceptual clustering by using integer linear programming techniques. Most other generic approaches for this problem tend to have problems scaling.

Compared to the segment abstraction algorithm by Walsh et al. [2010] for the same problem, it yields two orders of magnitude improvement in run time and significant improvement in abstraction quality. These benefits hold both for guaranteed and non-guaranteed campaigns. The performance stems from three improvements: 1) a quadratic-time (as opposed to doubly exponential or heuristic) algorithm for finding an optimal split of an abstract segment, 2) a better scoring function for evaluating splits, and 3) splitting time lossily like any other targeting attribute (instead of losslessly segmenting time first)",

We extend this idea to allow the use of multiple intermediate goal states and show that heuristic I is no longer effective. We solve this problem and show that our heuristic D is effective in this situation. Sokoban is a well-known single-agent search domain characterized by a large branching factor, long solution lengths, and the presence of unsolvable states.

    "abstract": "A Virtual Best Solver (VBS) is a hypothetical algorithm that selects the best solver from a given portfolio of alternatives on a per-instance basis. The VBS idealizes performance when all solvers in a portfolio are run in parallel, and also gives a valuable bound on the performance of portfolio-based algorithm selectors. Typically, VBS performance is measured by running every solver in a portfolio once on a given instance and reporting the best performance over all solvers. Here, we argue that doing so results in a flawed measure that is biased to reporting better performance when a randomized solver is present in an algorithm portfolio. As long as there is more than 1 solver in the portfolio, a single randomized solver can cause VBS bias. Specifically, this flawed notion of VBS tends to show performance better than that achievable by a perfect selector that for each given instance runs the solver with the best expected running time. We report results from an empirical study using solvers and instances submitted to several SAT competitions, in which we observe significant bias on many random instances and some combinatorial instances. We also show that the bias increases with the number of randomized solvers and decreases as we average solver performance over many independent runs per instance. We propose an alternative VBS performance measure by (1) empirically obtaining the solver with best expected performance for each instance and (2) taking bootstrap samples for this solver on every instance, to obtain a confidence interval on VBS performance. Our findings shed new light on widely studied algorithm selection benchmarks and help explain performance gaps observed between VBS and state-of-the-art algorithm selection approaches",

In this context, formal specification languages have been devised to express constraint problems in a manner similar to natural yet rigorous specifications that use a mixture of natural language and discrete mathematics. Yet, a gap remains between such languages and the natural language in which humans informally describe problems. This work aims to alleviate this issue by proposing a method for detecting constraints in natural language problem descriptions using a structured-output classifier. To evaluate the method, we develop an original annotated corpus which gathers 110 problem descriptions from several resources. Our results show significant accuracy with respect to metrics used in cognate tasks",

    "abstract": "We present a new preprocessing technique for propositional model counting. This technique leverages definability, i.e., the ability to determine that some gates are implied by the input formula Σ. Such gates can be exploited to simplify Σ without modifying its number of models. Unlike previous techniques based on gate detection and replacement, gates do not need to be made explicit in our approach. Our preprocessing technique thus consists of two phases: computing a bipartition I, O of the variables of Σ where the variables from O are defined in Σ in terms of I, then eliminating some variables of O in Σ. Our experiments show the computational benefits which can be achieved by taking advantage of our preprocessing technique for model counting",

An efficient GAC filtering algorithm is presented for the reflex ordering constraint. We propose the ReflexLeader method, which is a variant of LexLeader using the reflex ordering instead, and give conditions when ReflexLeader is safe to combine with the Precedence and multiset ordering constraints.

    "abstract": "Complex collaborative activities such as treating patients, co-authoring documents and developing software are often characterized by teamwork that is loosely coupled and extends in time. To remain coordinated and avoid conflicts, team members need to identify dependencies between their activities — which though loosely coupled may interact — and share information appropriately. The loose-coupling of tasks increases the difficulty of identifying dependencies, with the result that team members often lack important information or are overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This paper formalizes a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork (ISLET). It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm, MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. Importantly, because the extended duration of the teamwork precludes team-members developing complete plans in advance, the MIP-Nets approach, unlike prior work on information sharing, does not rely on a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans. Instead, it models collaboration patterns and dependencies among people and their activities based on team-members' interactions. Empirical evaluations show that this approach is able to learn collaboration patterns and identify relevant information to share with team members",

This paper studies interactive teaching strategies for identifying when a student can benefit from teacher-advice in a reinforcement learning framework. In student-teacher learning, a teacher agent can advise the student on which action to take. Prior work has considered heuristics for the teacher to choose advising opportunities. While these approaches effectively accelerate agent training, they assume that the teacher constantly monitors the student. This assumption may not be satisfied with human teachers, as people incur cognitive costs of monitoring and might not always pay attention. We propose strategies for a teacher and a student to jointly identify advising opportunities so that the teacher is not required to constantly monitor the student. Experimental results show that these approaches reduce the amount of attention required from the teacher compared to teacher-initiated strategies, while maintaining similar learning gains. The empirical evaluation also investigates the effect of the information communicated to the teacher and the quality of the student's initial policy on teaching outcomes",

However, human domain experts often have difficulty describing their decision-making processes, causing the codification of this knowledge to become laborious.

The traditional methods for describing schemas define the primitives and the relationships between them in advance. Therefore, it is difficult to adapt the constructed schemas in new situations. However, the proposed method constructs the schemas automatically from the data. Therefore, it has a novelty that the constructed schemas can be applied to new and unexpected situations flexibly. The key idea of constructing the hierarchical schema is selecting informative sensory data, integrating them sequentially and extracting high-level information. For the experiments, we collected sensory data using multiple wearable devices in restaurant situations. The experimental results demonstrate the real hierarchical schemas, which are probabilistic scripts and action primitives, constructed from the methods. Also, we show the constructed schemas can be used to predict the corresponding event to the low-level sensor data. Moreover, we show the prediction accuracy outperforms the conventional method significantly",

Taking inspiration from the psychological Belief-Desire Theory of Emotions (BDTE), our work specifies models of hope and fear based on best and worst forward traces. To efficiently estimate these traces, we integrate a well-known Monte Carlo Tree Search procedure (UCT) into a model based RL architecture. Test results in three known RL domains illustrate emotion dynamics, dependencies on policy and environmental stochasticity, and plausibility in individual Pacman game settings. Our models enable agents to naturally elicit hope and fear during learning, and moreover, explain what anticipated event caused this",

We present an algorithm for segmenting a path and mapping each segment to an utterance, as a function of the desired point in the verbalization space, and demonstrate its application using our mobile service robot moving in our buildings.

To tackle this problem we propose iDR, an interactive system for generating personalized appliance usage scheduling recommendations that maximize savings and convenience with minimal intrusiveness.

Understanding and verifying the refutation generated by the prover turned out to be a time-consuming task. Its completion, as reported here, required the reconstruction of the refutation in the Isabelle proof assistant, and it also led to a novel and more efficient way of automating higher-order modal logic S5 with a universal accessibility relation. Furthermore, the development of an improved syntactical hiding for the utilized logic embedding technique allows the refutation to be presented in a human-friendly way, suitable for non experts in the technicalities of higher-order theorem proving.

However, for optimization problems this approach lacks the possibility to report solutions before the optimum is found, and for search problems it often computes a lot of unnecessary rows. In this paper, we present a novel ASP-based system allowing for \"lazy\" DP, which utilizes recent multi-shot ASP technology. Preliminary experimental results show that this approach not only yields better performance for search problems, but also outperforms some state-of-the-art ASP encodings for optimization problems in terms of anytime computation, i.e., measuring the quality of the best solution after a certain timeout",

Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for defining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the initial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we look at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from contracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the plausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the most straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of permissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining plausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are characterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling properties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated contraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision. We finish by observing that a salient member of this family allows for the derivation of counterparts for contraction of some well known iterated revision operators, as well as for defining new iterated contraction operators",

    "abstract": "Choosing a language for knowledge representation and reasoning involves a trade-off between two competing desiderata: succinctness (the encoding should be small) and tractability (the language should support efficient reasoning algorithms). The area of knowledge compilation is devoted to the systematic study of representation languages along these two dimensions — in particular, it aims to determine the relative succinctness of languages. Showing that one language is more succinct than another typically involves proving a nontrivial lower bound on the encoding size of a carefully chosen function, and the corresponding arguments increase in difficulty with the succinctness of the target language. In this paper, we introduce a general technique for obtaining lower bounds on Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNFs), one of the most widely studied and succinct representation languages, by relating the size of DNNFs to multi-partition communication complexity. This allows us to directly translate lower bounds from the communication complexity literature into lower bounds on the size of DNNF representations. We use this approach to prove exponential separations of DNNFs from deterministic DNNFs and of CNF formulas from DNNFs",

First, we prove that the epistemic planning problem with propositional preconditions and without postconditions is in PSPACE, and is thus PSPACE-complete.

We focus on model-conservative rewritability (T' entails T and all models of T are expandable to models of T'), subsumption-conservative rewritability (T' entails T and all subsumptions in the signature of T entailed by T' are entailed by T), and standard description logics between ALC and ALCQI. We give model-theoretic characterizations of conservative rewritability via bisimulations, inverse p-morphisms and generated subinterpretations, and use them to obtain a few rewriting algorithms and complexity results for deciding rewritability",

We first analyse this problem from the point of view of machine learning theory, determining the VC dimension of possibilistic stratifications as well as the complexity of the associated learning problems, after which we present a heuristic learning algorithm that can easily scale to thousands of defaults. An important property of our approach is that it is inherently able to handle noisy and conflicting sets of defaults. Among others, this allows us to learn possibilistic logic theories from crowdsourced data and to approximate propositional Markov logic networks using heuristic MAP solvers. We present experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach",

In this paper we investigate the problem of answering metaqueries in Hi(OWL 2 QL), which are unions of conjunctive queries with both ABox and TBox atoms. We first focus on a specific class of ontologies, called TBox-complete, where there is no uncertainty about TBox axioms, and show that query answering in this case has the same complexity (both data and combined) as in OWL2QL. We then move to general ontologies and show that answering metaqueries is coNP-complete with respect to ontology complexity, Π2p-complete with respect to combined complexity, and remains AC0 with respect to ABox complexity. Finally, we present an optimized query answering algorithm that can be used for TBox-complete ontologies",

However, systematically modeling a location's context (i.e., the set of locations visited before or after this location) is relatively unexplored. In this paper, by leveraging the Skip-gram model, we learn the latent representation for a location to capture the influence of its context. A pair-wise ranking loss that considers the confidences of observed user preferences for locations is then proposed to learn users' latent representations for personalized top-N location recommendations. Moreover, we also extend our model by taking into account temporal influence. Stochastic gradient descent based optimization algorithms are developed to fit the models. We conduct comprehensive experiments over four real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art location recommendation methods",

    "abstract": "We propose a new algorithm called DPC+ to enforce partial path consistency (PPC) on qualitative constraint networks. PPC restricts path consistency (PC) to a triangulation of the underlying constraint graph of a network. As PPC retains the sparseness of a constraint graph, it can make reasoning tasks such as consistency checking and minimal labelling of large qualitative constraint networks much easier to tackle than PC. For qualitative constraint networks defined over any distributive subalgebra of well-known spatio-temporal calculi, such as the Region Connection Calculus and the Interval Algebra, we show that DPC+ can achieve PPC very fast. Indeed, the algorithm enforces PPC on a qualitative constraint network by processing each triangle in a triangulation of its underlying constraint graph at most three times. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements of DPC+ over the state-of-the-art PPC enforcing algorithm",

    "title": "Belief Update for Proper Epistemic Knowledge Bases",
    "abstract": "Reasoning about the nested beliefs of others is important in many multi-agent scenarios. While epistemic and doxastic logics lay a solid groundwork to approach such reasoning, the computational complexity of these logics is often too high for many tasks. Proper Epistemic Knowledge Bases (PEKBs) enforce two syntactic restrictions on formulae to obtain efficient querying: both disjunction and infinitely long nestings of modal operators are not permitted. PEKBs can be compiled, in exponential time, to a prime implicate formula that can be queried in polynomial time, while more recently, it was shown that consistent PEKBs had certain logical properties that meant this compilation was unnecessary, while still retaining polynomial-time querying. In this paper, we present a belief update mechanism for PEKBs that ensures the knowledge base remains consistent when new beliefs are added. This is achieved by first erasing any formulae that contradict these new beliefs. We show that this update mechanism can be computed in polynomial time, and we assess it against the well-known KM postulates for belief update",

    "abstract": "Computational and model-theoretic properties of logical languages constitute a central field of research in logic-based knowledge representation. Datalog is a very popular formalism, a de-facto standard for expressing and querying knowledge. Diverse results exist regarding the expressivity of Datalog and its extension by input negation (semipositive Datalog) and/or a linear order (order-invariant Datalog). When classifying the expressivity of logical formalisms by their model-theoretic properties, a very natural and prominent such property is preservation under homomorphisms. This paper solves the remaining open questions needed to arrive at a complete picture regarding the interrelationships between the class of homomorphism-closed queries and the query classes related to the four versions of Datalog. Most notably, we exhibit a query that is both homomorphism-closed and computable in polynomial time but cannot be expressed in order-invariant Datalog",

In this setting, each agent expresses her belief through a propositional formula and revises her own belief at each step by considering the beliefs of her acquaintances, using belief change tools. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which BRGs satisfy some monotonicity properties, i.e., whether promoting some desired piece of belief to a given set of agents is actually always useful for making it accepted by all of them. We formally capture such a concept of promotion by a new family of belief change operators. We show that some basic monotonicity properties are not satisfied by BRGs in general, even when the agent's merging-based revision policies are fully rational (in the AGM sense). We also identify some classes where they hold",

We propose a solution in which a normative planning problem serves as the basis for a practical reasoning approach based on argumentation. The properties of the best plan(s) w.r.t. goal achievement and norm compliance are mapped to arguments that are used to explain why a plan is justified, using a dialogue game",

    "abstract": "Model-Based Diagnosis is a principled approach to identify the possible causes when a system under observation behaves unexpectedly. In case the number of possible explanations for the unexpected behavior is large, sequential diagnosis approaches can be applied. The strategy of such approaches is to iteratively take additional measurements to narrow down the set of alternatives in order to find the true cause of the problem. In this paper we propose a sound and complete sequential diagnosis approach which does not require any information about the structure of the diagnosed system. The method is based on the new concept of \"partial\" diagnoses, which can be efficiently computed given a small number of minimal conflicts. As a result, the overall time needed for determining the best next measurement point can be significantly reduced. An experimental evaluation on different benchmark problems shows that our sequential diagnosis approach needs considerably less computation time when compared with an existing domain-independent approach",

    "title": "Diagnosability of Discrete-Event Systems with Uncertain Observations",
    "abstract": "Diagnosability is the property that a Discrete-Event System (DES) exhibits if every fault can be detected and isolated within a finite number of (observable) events that have taken place after its occurrence. In the literature, diagnosability of DESs relies on the availability of a certain observation, which equals the sequence of observable events that have taken place in the DES. But can diagnosability be achieved even if the observation is uncertain? The present paper provides an answer to this question when the observation is temporally or logically uncertain, that is, when the order of the observed events or their (discrete) values are partially unknown. The original notion of compound observable event enables a smooth extension of both the definition of DES diagnosability in the literature and the twin plant method to check such a property. The intuition is to deal with a compound observable event the same way as with a single event. In case a DES is diagnosable even if its observation is uncertain, the diagnosis task can be performed (without any loss in the ability to identify every fault) although the available measuring equipment cannot get a certain observation",
