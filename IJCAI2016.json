    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "We propose a model of interdependent scheduling games in which each player controls a set of services that they schedule independently. A player is free to schedule his own services at any time; however, each of these services only begins to accrue reward for the player when all predecessor services, which may or may not be controlled by the same player, have been activated. This model, where players have interdependent services, is motivated by the problems faced in planning and coordinating large-scale infrastructures, e.g., restoring electricity and gas to residents after a natural disaster or providing medical care in a crisis when different agencies are responsible for the delivery of staff, equipment, and medicine. We undertake a game-theoretic analysis of this setting and in particular consider the issues of welfare maximization, computing best responses, Nash dynamics, and existence and computation of Nash equilibria",

Existing research in exploiting these synergistic interactions between the two problems have either only considered domains where tasks/resources are completely independent of each other or have focussed on approaches with limited scalability. In this paper, we address these two limitations by introducing a generic model for task/resource constrained multi-agent stochastic planning, referred to as TasC-MDPs. We provide two scalable greedy algorithms, one of which provides posterior quality guarantees. Finally, we illustrate the high scalability and solution performance of our approaches in comparison with existing work on two benchmark problems from the literature",

Given a set of n players, the maximin share of a single player is the best she can guarantee to herself, if she would partition the items in any way she prefers, into n bundles, and then receive her least desirable bundle. The objective then is to find an allocation, so that each player is guaranteed her maximin share. Previous works have studied this problem purely algorithmically, providing constant factor approximation algorithms. In this work, we embark on a mechanism design approach and investigate the existence of truthful mechanisms. We propose three models regarding the information that the mechanism attempts to elicit from the players, based on the cardinal and ordinal representation of preferences. We establish positive and negative (impossibility) results for each model and highlight the limitations imposed by truthfulness on the approximability of the problem.

We assume that these costs are unknown to the mechanisms (and possibly even to the agents themselves), which means we cannot simply select the optimal alternative, i.e. the alternative that minimizes the total agent cost (or median agent cost). However, we do assume that the agents know their ordinal preferences that are induced by the metric space. We examine randomized social choice functions that require only this ordinal information and select an alternative that is good in expectation with respect to the costs from the metric. To quantify how good a randomized social choice function is, we bound the distortion, which is the worst-case ratio between expected cost of the alternative selected and the cost of the optimal alternative. We provide new distortion bounds for a variety of randomized mechanisms, for both general metrics and for important special cases. Our results show a sizable improvement in distortion over deterministic mechanisms",

More specifically, these games model the agents' strategic decision of expressing publicly an opinion, which is a result of an interplay between the agent's private belief and the social pressure. However, these games have very limited expressive power; they can model only very simple social relations and they assume that all the agents respond to social pressure in the same way. In this paper, we define and study the novel class of generalized discrete preference games. These games have additional characteristics that can model social relations to allies or competitors and complex relations among more than two agents. Moreover, they introduce different levels of strength for each relation, and they personalize the dependence of each agent to her neighborhood",

Earlier work has studied the implications of setting the value of the quota on the agents' power under the assumption that the game is given with a fixed set of agent weights. We focus on a model where the agent weights originate from a stochastic process, resulting in weight uncertainty. We analyze the expected effect of the quota on voting power given the weight generating process. We examine two extreme cases of the balls and bins model: uniform and exponentially decaying probabilities. We show that the choice of a quota may have a large influence on the power disparity of the agents, even when the governing distribution is likely to result in highly similar weights for the agents.

In many congestion games, each player's number of strategies can be exponential in the natural description of the game. Most existing algorithms for game theoretic computation, from computing expected utilities and best responses to finding Nash equilibrium and other solution concepts, all involve enumeration of pure strategies. As a result, such algorithms would take exponential time on these congestion games. In this work, we study congestion games in which each player's strategy space can be described compactly using a set of linear constraints. For instance, network congestion games naturally fall into this subclass as each player's strategy can be described by a set of flow constraints. We show that we can represent any mixed strategy compactly using marginals which specify the probability of using each resource. As a consequence, the expected utilities and the best responses can be computed in polynomial time. We reduce the problem of computing a best/worst symmetric approximate mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in symmetric congestion games to a constraint optimization problem on a graph formed by the resources and the strategy constraints. As a result, we present a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for this problem when the graph has bounded tree width",

Previous works consider the problem where the pairwise winning probabilities are known precisely, while we study how robust is the winning probability with respect to small errors in the pairwise winning probabilities. First, we present several illuminating examples to establish: (a) there exist deterministic tournaments (where the pairwise winning probabilities are 0 or 1) where one optimal draw is much more robust than the other; and (b) in general, there exist tournaments with slightly suboptimal draws that are more robust than all the optimal draws. The above examples motivate the study of the computational problem of robust draws that guarantee a specified winning probability. Second, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating the robustness of a draw for sufficiently small errors in pairwise winning probabilities, and obtain that the stated computational problem is NP-complete. We also show that two natural cases of deterministic tournaments where the optimal draw could be computed in polynomial time also admit polynomial-time algorithms to compute robust optimal draws",

For the case with two items: We provide a set of sufficient conditions for strategyproofness. We use an analytic approach to derive strategyproof mechanisms which are more competitive than all prior strategyproof mechanisms. We improve the linear-program-based proof of Guo and Conitzer to show new upper bounds on competitive ratios. We provide the first compact proof on upper bound of competitiveness. For the cases with any number of items, we build on the Partial Allocation mechanisms introduced by Cole et al. to design a strategyproof mechanism which is 0.67776-competitive, breaking the 2/3 barrier. We also propose a new sub-class of strategyproof mechanisms for any numbers of agents and items, which we call it Dynamic-Increasing-Price mechanisms, where each agent purchases the items using virtual money, and the prices of the items depend on other agents' preferences",

    "abstract": "Interactive dynamic influence diagrams~(I-DIDs) provide an explicit way of modeling how a subject agent solves decision making problems in the presence of other agents in a common setting. To optimize its decisions, the subject agent needs to predict the other agents' behavior, that is generally obtained by solving their candidate models. This becomes extremely difficult since the model space may be rather large, and grows when the other agents act and observe over the time. A recent proposal for solving I-DIDs lies in a concept of value equivalence (VE) that shows potential advances on significantly reducing the model space. In this paper, we establish a principled framework to implement the VE techniques and propose an approximate method to compute VE of candidate models. The development offers ample opportunity of exploiting VE to further improve the scalability of I-DID solutions. We theoretically analyze properties of the approximate techniques and show empirical results in multiple problem domains",

We extend this line of research and study preference elicitation for single peaked preferences on trees which is a strict superset of the domain of single peaked preferences. We show that the query complexity crucially depends on the number of leaves, the path cover number, and the distance from path of the underlying single peaked tree, whereas the other natural parameters like maximum degree, diameter, pathwidth do not play any direct role in determining query complexity. We then investigate the query complexity for finding a weak Condorcet winner for preferences single peaked on a tree and show that this task has much less query complexity than preference elicitation.

    "abstract": "The Coalitional Manipulation problem has been studied extensively in the literature for many voting rules. However, most studies have focused on the complete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the non-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing intractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most real-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate knowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation with incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial order for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter. In this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of manipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems are easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator). For many of them, the corresponding manipulative questions that we propose turn out to be computationally intractable. Our hardness results often hold even when very little information is missing, or in other words, even when the instances are quite close to the complete information setting. Our overall conclusion is that computational hardness continues to be a valid obstruction to manipulation, in the context of a more realistic model",

Standard exchange models, such as house allocation and kidney exchange cannot be applied to an emerging industrial application, coined digital good exchange, where an agent still possesses her initial endowment after exchanging with others. However, her valuation toward her endowment decreases as it is possessed by more agents. We put forward game theoretical models tailored for digital good exchange. In the first part of the paper, we first consider a natural class of games where agents can choose either a subset of other participants' items or no participation at all. It turns out that this class of games can be modeled as a variant of congestion games. We prove that it is in general NP-complete to determine whether there exists a non-trivial pure Nash equilibrium where at least some agent chooses a nonempty subset of items. However, we show that in a subset of games for single-minded agents with unit demand, there exist non-trivial Pure Nash equilibria and put forward an efficient algorithm to find such equilibria. In the second part of the paper, we investigate digital good exchange from a mechanism design perspective. We ask if there is a truthful mechanism in this setting that can achieve good social welfare guarantee. To this end, we design a randomized fixed-price-exchange mechanism that is individually rational and truthful, and for two-player case yields a tight log-approximation with respect to any individually rational allocation",

We develop novel allocation and payment mechanisms which truthfully elicit the EV owners' preferences and constraints, including arrival, departure, required charge, as well as the costs of discharging due to loss of efficiency of the battery. The car park will schedule the charging and discharging of each EV, ensuring the constraints of the EVs are met, and taking into consideration predictions about future electricity prices. Optimally solving the global problem is intractable, and we present three novel heuristic online scheduling algorithms.

    "abstract": "We consider a nonatomic selfish routing model with independent stochastic travel times for each edge, represented by mean and variance latency functions that depend on arc flows. This model can apply to traffic in the Internet or in a road network. Variability negatively impacts packets or drivers, by introducing jitter in transmission delays which lowers quality of streaming audio or video, or by making it more difficult to predict the arrival time at destination. The price of risk aversion (PRA) has been defined as the worst-case ratio of the cost of an equilibrium with risk-averse players who seek risk-minimizing paths, and that of an equilibrium with risk-neutral users who minimize the mean travel time of a path [Nikolova and Stier-Moses, 2015]. This inefficiency metric captures the degradation of system performance caused by variability and risk aversion. In this paper, we provide the first lower bounds on the PRA. First, we show a family of structural lower bounds, which grow linearly with the size of the graph and players' risk-aversion. They are tight for graph sizes that are powers of two. We also provide asymptotically tight functional bounds that depend on the allowed latency functions but not on the topology. The functional bounds match the price-of-anarchy bounds for congestion games multiplied by an extra factor that accounts for risk aversion. Finally, we provide a closed-form formula of the PRA for a family of graphs that generalize series-parallel graphs and the Braess graph. This formula also applies to the mean-standard deviation user objective a much more complex model of risk-aversion due to the cost of a path being non-additive over edge costs",

The direct mechanism elicits both response probabilities and costs, while the indirect mechanism elicits willingness to accept a penalty in the case of non-response. We benchmark against a spot auction, in which demand reduction is purchased from agents when needed. Both the direct and indirect mechanisms achieve the reliability target in a dominant-strategy equilibrium, select a small number of agents to prepare, and do so at low cost and with much lower variance in payments than the spot auction",

We first characterize serial dictatorships by a minimal set of three axiomatic properties: strategy-proofness, non-bossiness, and category-wise neutrality. Then, we propose a natural extension of serial dictatorships called categorial sequential allocation mechanisms (CSAMs), which allocate the items in multiple rounds: in each round, the designated agent chooses an item from a designated category.

Researchers have studied norm emergence through social learning where the agents interact repeatedly in a graph structure. In contrast, we consider norm emergence in an open system, where membership can change, and where no predetermined graph structure exists. We propose Silk, a mechanism wherein a generator monitors interactions among member agents and recommends norms to help resolve conflicts. Each member decides on whether to accept or reject a recommended norm. Upon exiting the system, a member passes its experience along to incoming members of the same type. Thus, members develop norms in a hybrid manner to resolve conflicts. We evaluate Silk via simulation in the traffic domain.

Such customers could otherwise contribute to balancing supply and demand in future smart grids. This paper proposes an innovative risk-sharing tariff to incentivize intelligent customer behavior. A two-step parameterized payment scheme is proposed, consisting of a prepayment based on the expected consumption, and a supplementary payment for any observed deviation from the anticipated consumption. Within a game-theoretical analysis, we capture the strategic conflict of interest between a retailer and a customer in a two-player game, and we present optimal, i.e., best response, strategies for both players in this game. We show analytically that the proposed tariff provides customers of varying flexibility with variable incentives to assume and alleviate a fraction of the balancing risk, contributing in this way to the uncertainty reduction in the envisioned smart-grid",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Consider a buyer with independent additive valuations for a set of goods, and a seller who is constrained to sell one item at a time in an online fashion. If the seller is constrained to run independent auctions for each item, then he would run Myerson's optimal auction for each item. If the seller is allowed to use the full power of dynamic mechanism design and have the auction for each item depend on the outcome of the previous auctions, he is able to perform much better. The main issues in implementing such strategies in online settings where items arrive over time are that the auction might be too complicated or it makes too strong assumptions on the buyer's rationality or seller's commitment over time. This motivates us to explore a restricted family of dynamic auctions that can be implemented in an online fashion and without too much commitment from the seller ahead of time. In particular, we study a set of auction in which the space of single-shot auctions is augmented with a structure that we call bank account, a real number for each node that summarizes the history so far. This structure allows the seller to store deficits or surpluses of buyer utility from each individual auction and even them out on the long run. This is akin to enforcing individual rationality constraint on average rather than per auction. We also study the effect of enforcing a maximum limit to the values that bank account might grow, which means that we enforce that besides the auction being individually rational on average it is also not far from being individually rational at any given interval. Interestingly, even with these restrictions, we can achieve significantly better revenue and social welfare compared to separate Myerson auctions",

While the output of such algorithms is informative to the recognizer, the cost of its calculation is high in run-time, space, and completeness. Moreover, performing plan recognition online requires the observing agent to reason about future actions that have not yet been seen and maintain a set of hypotheses to support all possible options. This paper presents a new and efficient algorithm for online plan recognition called SLIM (Semi-Lazy Inference Mechanism). It combines both a bottom-up and top-down parsing processes, which allow it to commit only to the minimum necessary actions in real-time, but still provide complete hypotheses post factum.

    "abstract": "Plan recognition algorithms infer agents' plans from their observed actions. Due to imperfect knowledge about the agent's behavior and the environment, it is often the case that there are multiple hypotheses about an agent's plans that are consistent with the observations, though only one of these hypotheses is correct. This paper addresses the problem of how to disambiguate between hypotheses, by querying the acting agent about whether a candidate plan in one of the hypotheses matches its intentions. This process is performed sequentially and used to update the set of possible hypotheses during the recognition process. The paper defines the sequential plan recognition process (SPRP), which seeks to reduce the number of hypotheses using a minimal number of queries. We propose a number of policies for the SPRP which use maximum likelihood and information gain to choose which plan to query. We show this approach works well in practice on two domains from the literature, significantly reducing the number of hypotheses using fewer queries than a baseline approach. Our results can inform the design of future plan recognition systems that interleave the recognition process with intelligent interventions of their users",

We formalize this problem and provide an easy-to-check necessary and sufficient condition for a given role assignment to induce cooperation. However, we show that finding whether such a role assignment exists is in general NP-hard. Nevertheless, we give two algorithms for solving the problem. The first is based on a mixed-integer linear program formulation. The second is based on a dynamic program, and runs in pseudopolynomial time if the number of agents is constant.

For example, a government may auction off spectrum from its public safety network, but it may need this spectrum back in times of emergency. In such a domain, standard combinatorial auctions perform poorly because they lead to violations of individual rationality (IR), even in expectation, and to very low efficiency. In this paper, we study the design of core-selecting payment rules for such domains. Surprisingly, we show that in this new domain, there does not exist a payment rule with is guaranteed to be ex-post core-selecting. However, we show that by designing rules that are execution-contingent, i.e., by charging payments that are conditioned on the realization of the availability of the goods, we can reduce IR violations. We design two core-selecting rules that always satisfy IR in expectation. To study the performance of our rules we perform a computational Bayes-Nash equilibrium analysis. We show that, in equilibrium, our new rules have better incentives, higher efficiency, and a lower rate of ex-post IR violations than standard core-selecting rules",

Therefore, an online mechanism is desirable if it incentivizes passengers to truthfully report their actual demand.

Prior work shows that the problem of determining the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium for these games is NP-complete already for graphs with all weights equal to one and no bonuses.

In this paper we identify several natural classes of graphs for which a finite improvement or coalition-improvement path of polynomial length always exists, and, as a consequence, a Nash equilibrium or strong equilibrium in them can be found in polynomial time.

To capture the uncertainty and partial observability of the domain, we model this problem as a POMDP. However, the resulting model is computationally intractable and cannot be solved by most existing POMDP solvers due to the large state and action spaces. By exploiting the problem structure we propose a novel online planning algorithm to solve this model. Specifically, we generate plans for the responders based on Monte-Carlo simulations and compute actions for the UAVs according to the value of information. Our empirical results confirm that our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art both in time and solution quality",

Many countries have built marine protected areas (MPAs) and protect their ecosystems through boat patrol.

In this paper, we view the problem of efficiently patrolling for protecting coral reef ecosystems from a game-theoretic perspective and propose 1) a new Stackelberg game model to formulate the problem of protecting MPAs, 2) two algorithms to compute the efficient protection agency's strategies: CLP in which the protection agency's strategies are compactly represented as fractional flows in a network, and CDOG which combines the techniques of compactly representing defender strategies and incrementally generating strategies.

    "abstract": "Election control encompasses attempts from an external agent to alter the structure of an election in order to change its outcome. This problem is both a fundamental theoretical problem in social choice, and a major practical concern for democratic institutions.Consequently, this issue has received considerable attention, particularly as it pertains to different voting rules. In contrast, the problem of how election control can be prevented or deterred has been largely ignored. We introduce the problem of optimal protection against election control, where manipulation is allowed at the granularity of groups of voters (e.g., voting locations), through a denial-of-service attack, and the defender allocates limited protection resources to prevent control. We show that for plurality voting, election control through group deletion to prevent a candidate from winning is in P, while it is NP-Hard to prevent such control. We then present a double-oracle framework for computing an optimal prevention strategy, developing exact mixed-integer linear programming for mulations for both the defender and attacker oracles (both of these subproblems we show to be NP-Hard), as well as heuristic oracles. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed computational framework can scale to realistic problem instances",

    "abstract": "This paper studies a decision-making problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems with safety density constraints. An individual agent's decision-making problem is modeled by the standard Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation. However, an important special case occurs when the MDP states may have limited capacities, hence upper bounds on the expected number of agents in each state are imposed. We refer to these upper bound constraints as \"safety\" constraints. If agents follow unconstrained policies (policies that do not impose the safety constraints), the safety constraints might be violated. In this paper, we devise algorithms that provide safe decision-making policies. The set of safe decision policies can be shown to be convex, and hence the policy synthesis is tractable via reliable and fast Interior Point Method (IPM) algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms first using a simple MDP, and then using a dynamic traffic assignment problem. The numerical results demonstrate that safe decision-making algorithms in this paper significantly outperform other baselines",

We argue that, while powerful, contemporary configurators limit themselves by abstracting information that can otherwise be exploited to speed up the optimization process as well as improve the quality of the resulting design.

    "abstract": "Many combinatorial problems are solved with a Depth-First search (DFS) guided by a heuristic and it is well-known that this method is very fragile with respect to heuristic mistakes. One standard way to make DFS more robust is to search by increasing number of discrepancies. This approach has been found useful in several domains where the search structure is a height-bounded OR tree. In this paper we investigate the generalization of discrepancy-based search to AND/OR search trees and propose an extension of the Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) algorithm. We demonstrate the relevance of our proposal in the context of Graphical Models. In these problems, which can be solved with either a standard OR search tree or an AND/OR tree, we show the superiority of our approach. For a fixed number of discrepancies, the search space visited by the AND/OR algorithm strictly contains the search space visited by standard LDS, and many more nodes can be visited due to the multiplicative effect of the AND/OR decomposition. Besides, if the AND/OR tree achieves a significant size reduction with respect to the standard OR tree, the cost of each iteration of the AND/OR algorithm is asymptotically lower than in standard LDS. We report experiments on the minsum problem on different domains and show that the AND/OR version of LDS usually obtains better solutions given the same CPU time",

To solve the problem, this paper presents an efficient algorithm, named FastLCD. Unlike previous popular move-making algorithms (e.g., α-expansion) that visit all the labels exhaustively in each step, FastLCD optimizes the 2D label MRFs by performing label coordinate descents alternately in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, and by this way, it does not need to visit all the labels exhaustively. FastLCD greatly reduces the search space of the label set and benefits from a lower time complexity.

When good actions are sparse, domain knowledge is often used to identify a discrete set of promising actions.

The reduction of the problem to a discrete search problem causes severe limitations, notably, not exploiting all of the sampled outcomes when evaluating actions, and not using outcomes to help find new actions outside the original set. We propose a new Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm specifically designed for exploiting an execution model in this setting. Using kernel regression, it generalizes the information about action quality between actions and to unexplored parts of the action space. In a high fidelity simulator of the olympic sport of curling, we show that this approach significantly outperforms existing MCTS methods",

    "title": "Bias in Algorithm Portfolio Performance Evaluation",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "A Virtual Best Solver (VBS) is a hypothetical algorithm that selects the best solver from a given portfolio of alternatives on a per-instance basis. The VBS idealizes performance when all solvers in a portfolio are run in parallel, and also gives a valuable bound on the performance of portfolio-based algorithm selectors. Typically, VBS performance is measured by running every solver in a portfolio once on a given instance and reporting the best performance over all solvers. Here, we argue that doing so results in a flawed measure that is biased to reporting better performance when a randomized solver is present in an algorithm portfolio. As long as there is more than 1 solver in the portfolio, a single randomized solver can cause VBS bias. Specifically, this flawed notion of VBS tends to show performance better than that achievable by a perfect selector that for each given instance runs the solver with the best expected running time. We report results from an empirical study using solvers and instances submitted to several SAT competitions, in which we observe significant bias on many random instances and some combinatorial instances. We also show that the bias increases with the number of randomized solvers and decreases as we average solver performance over many independent runs per instance. We propose an alternative VBS performance measure by (1) empirically obtaining the solver with best expected performance for each instance and (2) taking bootstrap samples for this solver on every instance, to obtain a confidence interval on VBS performance. Our findings shed new light on widely studied algorithm selection benchmarks and help explain performance gaps observed between VBS and state-of-the-art algorithm selection approaches",

This article presents a novel decision procedure for LRA that leverages SMT solvers for the ground fragment of LRA, but avoids explicit quantifier elimination. The intuition behind the algorithm stems from an interpretation of a quantified formula as a game between two players, whose goals are to prove that the formula is either satisfiable or not.

    "abstract": "Complex collaborative activities such as treating patients, co-authoring documents and developing software are often characterized by teamwork that is loosely coupled and extends in time. To remain coordinated and avoid conflicts, team members need to identify dependencies between their activities — which though loosely coupled may interact — and share information appropriately. The loose-coupling of tasks increases the difficulty of identifying dependencies, with the result that team members often lack important information or are overwhelmed by irrelevant information. This paper formalizes a new multi-agent systems problem, Information Sharing in Loosely-Coupled Extended-Duration Teamwork (ISLET). It defines a new representation, Mutual Influence Potential Networks (MIP-Nets) and an algorithm, MIP-DOI, that uses this representation to determine the information that is most relevant to each team member. Importantly, because the extended duration of the teamwork precludes team-members developing complete plans in advance, the MIP-Nets approach, unlike prior work on information sharing, does not rely on a priori knowledge of a team's possible plans. Instead, it models collaboration patterns and dependencies among people and their activities based on team-members' interactions. Empirical evaluations show that this approach is able to learn collaboration patterns and identify relevant information to share with team members",

While these approaches effectively accelerate agent training, they assume that the teacher constantly monitors the student. This assumption may not be satisfied with human teachers, as people incur cognitive costs of monitoring and might not always pay attention. We propose strategies for a teacher and a student to jointly identify advising opportunities so that the teacher is not required to constantly monitor the student. Experimental results show that these approaches reduce the amount of attention required from the teacher compared to teacher-initiated strategies, while maintaining similar learning gains.

Understanding and verifying the refutation generated by the prover turned out to be a time-consuming task. Its completion, as reported here, required the reconstruction of the refutation in the Isabelle proof assistant, and it also led to a novel and more efficient way of automating higher-order modal logic S5 with a universal accessibility relation. Furthermore, the development of an improved syntactical hiding for the utilized logic embedding technique allows the refutation to be presented in a human-friendly way, suitable for non experts in the technicalities of higher-order theorem proving.

Specifically, just as the Harper Identity provides a recipe for defining the belief set resulting from contracting A in terms of (i) the initial belief set and (ii) the belief set resulting from revision by not-A, we look at ways to define the plausibility ordering over worlds resulting from contracting A in terms of (iii) the initial plausibility ordering, and (iv) the plausibility ordering resulting from revision by not-A. After noting that the most straightforward such extension leads to a trivialisation of the space of permissible orderings, we provide a family of operators for combining plausibility orderings that avoid such a result. These operators are characterised in our domain of interest by a pair of intuitively compelling properties, which turn out to enable the derivation of a number of iterated contraction postulates from postulates for iterated revision. We finish by observing that a salient member of this family allows for the derivation of counterparts for contraction of some well known iterated revision operators, as well as for defining new iterated contraction operators",

The area of knowledge compilation is devoted to the systematic study of representation languages along these two dimensions — in particular, it aims to determine the relative succinctness of languages. Showing that one language is more succinct than another typically involves proving a nontrivial lower bound on the encoding size of a carefully chosen function, and the corresponding arguments increase in difficulty with the succinctness of the target language. In this paper, we introduce a general technique for obtaining lower bounds on Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNFs), one of the most widely studied and succinct representation languages, by relating the size of DNNFs to multi-partition communication complexity. This allows us to directly translate lower bounds from the communication complexity literature into lower bounds on the size of DNNF representations.

    "abstract": "The capability to predict changes of spatial regions is important for an intelligent system that interacts with the physical world. For example, in a disaster management scenario, predicting potentially endangered areas and inferring safe zones is essential for planning evacuations and countermeasures. Existing approaches usually predict such spatial changes by simulating the physical world based on specific models. Thus, these simulation-based methods will not be able to provide reliable predictions when the scenario is not similar to any of the models in use or when the input parameters are incomplete. In this paper, we present a prediction approach that overcomes the aforementioned problem by using a more general model and by analysing the trend of the spatial changes. The method is also flexible to adopt to new observations and to adapt its prediction to new situations",

    "title": "Towards Fast Algorithms for the Preference Consistency Problem Based on Hierarchical Models",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we construct and compare algorithmic approaches to solve the Preference Consistency Problem for preference statements based on hierarchical models. Instances of this problem contain a set of preference statements that are direct comparisons (strict and non-strict) between some alternatives, and a set of evaluation functions by which all alternatives can be rated. An instance is consistent based on hierarchical preference models, if there exists an hierarchical model on the evaluation functions that induces an order relation on the alternatives by which all relations given by the preference statements are satisfied. Deciding if an instance is consistent is known to be NP-complete for hierarchical models. We develop three approaches to solve this decision problem. The first involves a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation, the other two are recursive algorithms that are based on properties of the problem by which the search space can be pruned. Our experiments on synthetic data show that the recursive algorithms are faster than solving the MILP formulation and that the ratio between the running times increases extremely quickly",

Results in this direction are mainly concerned with adapting representation theorems. However, fragment-driven belief change also leads to novel research questions. In this paper we propose the concept of belief distribution, which can be understood as the reverse task of merging. More specifically, we are interested in the following question: given an arbitrary knowledge base K and some merging operator Δ, can we find a profile E and a constraint μ, both from a given fragment of classical logic, such that Δμ(E) yields a result equivalent to K? In other words, we are interested in seeing if K can be distributed into knowledge bases of simpler structure, such that the task of merging allows for a reconstruction of the original knowledge. Our initial results show that merging based on drastic distance allows for an easy distribution of knowledge, while the power of distribution for operators based on Hamming distance relies heavily on the fragment of choice",

We propose a structured inference system for this task, formulated as an Integer Linear Program (ILP), that answers natural language questions using a semi-structured knowledge base derived from text, including questions requiring multi-step inference and a combination of multiple facts. On a dataset of real, unseen science questions, our system significantly outperforms (+14%) the best previous attempt at structured reasoning for this task, which used Markov Logic Networks (MLNs).

PEKBs can be compiled, in exponential time, to a prime implicate formula that can be queried in polynomial time, while more recently, it was shown that consistent PEKBs had certain logical properties that meant this compilation was unnecessary, while still retaining polynomial-time querying.

    "title": "Diagnosability of Discrete-Event Systems with Uncertain Observations",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Diagnosability is the property that a Discrete-Event System (DES) exhibits if every fault can be detected and isolated within a finite number of (observable) events that have taken place after its occurrence. In the literature, diagnosability of DESs relies on the availability of a certain observation, which equals the sequence of observable events that have taken place in the DES. But can diagnosability be achieved even if the observation is uncertain? The present paper provides an answer to this question when the observation is temporally or logically uncertain, that is, when the order of the observed events or their (discrete) values are partially unknown. The original notion of compound observable event enables a smooth extension of both the definition of DES diagnosability in the literature and the twin plant method to check such a property. The intuition is to deal with a compound observable event the same way as with a single event. In case a DES is diagnosable even if its observation is uncertain, the diagnosis task can be performed (without any loss in the ability to identify every fault) although the available measuring equipment cannot get a certain observation",

Our approach is sound and complete for ontologies expressed in the lightweight DL DL-Lite, but for more expressive DLs the problem is known to be intractable, hence our algorithm only computes upper approximations. Nevertheless, its structure motivates a new type of ICAR-like semantics which can be computed in polynomial time for a very large family of DLs.

By regarding each relation as one translation from head entity to tail entity, translation-based methods including TransE, TransH and TransR are simple, effective and achieving the state-of-the-art performance. However, they still suffer the following issues: (i) low performance when modeling 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations. (ii) limited performance due to the structure sparseness of the knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge graph representation learning method by taking advantage of the rich context information in a text corpus. The rich textual context information is incorporated to expand the semantic structure of the knowledge graph and each relation is enabled to own different representations for different head and tail entities to better handle 1-to-N, N-to-1 and N-to-N relations.

Qualitative spatial and temporal representation (QSTR) is concerned with abstractions of infinite spatial and temporal domains, which represent configurations of objects using a finite vocabulary of relations, also called a qualitative calculus. Classically, reasoning in QSTR is based on constraints. An important task is to identify decision procedures that are able to handle constraints from a single calculus or from several calculi. In particular the latter aspect is a longstanding challenge due to the multitude of calculi proposed. In this paper we consider propositional closures of qualitative constraints which enable progress with respect to the longstanding challenge. Propositional closure allows one to establish several translations between distinct calculi. This enables joint reasoning and provides new insights into computational complexity of individual calculi. We conclude that the study of propositional languages instead of previously considered purely relational languages is a viable research direction for QSTR leading to expressive formalisms and practical algorithms",

As precise link prediction is critical, we propose a manifold-based embedding principle (ManifoldE) which could be treated as a well-posed algebraic system that expands the position of golden triples from one point in current models to a manifold in ours.

In particular, we consider a general approach where changes are detected by comparing the distribution of the log-likelihood of the datastream over different time windows. Despite the fact that this approach constitutes the frame of several change-detection methods, its effectiveness when data dimension scales has never been investigated, which is indeed the goal of our paper. We show that the magnitude of the change can be naturally measured by the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions, and that the detectability of a change of a given magnitude worsens when the data dimension increases. This problem, which we refer to as detectability loss, is due to the linear relationship between the variance of the log-likelihood and the data dimension. We analytically derive the detectability loss on Gaussian-distributed datastreams, and empirically demonstrate that this problem holds also on real-world datasets and that can be harmful even at low data-dimensions (say, 10)",

To address the first challenge, we formulate the problem as predicting the percentage of a story a user will listen to; to address the remaining challenges, we propose several matrix factorization algorithms that cluster users, n-grams, and stories simultaneously, while optimizing prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate our approach on a dataset of 50K users, 26K stories, and 975K interactions collected over a five month period.

However, globally optimized latent factors may not reflect the unique interests shared among only subsets of users/items, without which unique interests of users may not be accurately modelled. As a result, existing MA methods, which cannot capture the uniqueness of different user/item, cannot provide optimal recommendation. In this paper, a mixture probabilistic matrix approximation (MPMA) method is proposed, which unifies globally optimized user/item feature vectors (on the entire rating matrix) and locally optimized user/item feature vectors (on subsets of user/item ratings) to improve recommendation accuracy. More specifically, in MPMA, a method is developed to find both globally and locally optimized user/item feature vectors. Then, a Gaussian mixture model is adopted to combine global predictions and local predictions to produce accurate rating predictions.

Different from previous work, we propose a principled and unified probabilistic model APE (Anomaly detection via Probabilistic pairwise interaction and Entity embedding) that directly models the likelihood of events. In this model, we embed entities into a common latent space using their observed co-occurrence in different events. More specifically, we first model the compatibility of each pair of entities according to their embeddings. Then we utilize the weighted pairwise interactions of different entity types to define the event probability. Using Noise-Contrastive Estimation with \"context-dependent\" noise distribution, our model can be learned efficiently regardless of the large event space.

This paper explores a novel inductive logic programming approach to learn such programs from examples. To reduce the complexity of the learned programs, and thus the search for such a program, we introduce higher-order operations involving an alternation of Abstraction and Invention. Abstractions are described using logic program definitions containing higher-order predicate variables. Inventions involve the construction of definitions for the predicate variables used in the Abstractions. The use of Abstractions extends the Meta-Interpretive Learning framework and is supported by the use of a user-extendable set of higher-order operators, such as map, until, and ifthenelse. Using these operators reduces the textual complexity required to express target classes of programs. We provide sample complexity results which indicate that the approach leads to reductions in the numbers of examples required to reach high predictive accuracy, as well as significant reductions in overall learning time. Our experiments demonstrate increased accuracy and reduced learning times in all cases.

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "With the rapid increase in the available data, it becomes computationally harder to extract useful information. Thus, several techniques like PCA were proposed to embed high-dimensional data into low-dimensional latent space. However, these techniques don't take the data relations into account. This motivated the development of other techniques like MDS and LLE which preserve the relations between the data instances. Nonetheless, all these techniques still use latent features, which are difficult for data analysts to understand and grasp the information encoded in them. In this work, a new embedding technique is proposed to mitigate the previous problems by projecting the data to a space described by few points (i.e, exemplars) which preserves the relations between the data points. The proposed method Exemplar-based Kernel Preserving (EBEK) embedding is shown theoretically to achieve the lowest reconstruction error of the kernel matrix. Using EBEK in approximate nearest neighbor task shows its ability to outperform related work by up to 60% in the recall while maintaining a good running time. In addition, our interpretability experiments show that EBEK's selected basis are more understandable than the latent basis in images datasets",

    "abstract": "A classifier able to minimize the generalization error of a particular problem for any set of unseen samples is named Bayes-optimal classifier. The hypothesis induced by such classifier is equivalent to the optimal Bayes point, which is approximately equivalent to the center of mass of the version space. However, there are only a few methods for estimating the center of mass and most of them are computationally expensive or impractical, especially for large datasets. In this paper we present the Version Space Reduction Machine (VSRM), a new method that obtains an approximation of the center of mass. The method works by means of successive reductions of the version space which are consistent with an oracle's decision. This oracle is represented by the majority voting of an ensemble, whose components must contain a reasonable diversity level to ensure an effective approximation. We conduct an experimental study on microarray datasets and assess the performance of the proposed method compared to Support Vector Machine and Bayes Point Machine. Our method consistently outperforms the others. Such result indicates that the proposed method provides a better approximation of the center of mass",

    "abstract": "The Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodels (MMSB) is a popular framework for modelling social relationships by fully exploiting each individual node's participation (or membership) in a social network. Despite its powerful representations, MMSB assumes that the membership indicators of each pair of nodes (i.e., people) are distributed independently. However, such an assumption often does not hold in real-life social networks, in which certain known groups of people may correlate with each other in terms of factors such as their membership categories. To expand MMSB's ability to model such dependent relationships, a new framework - a Copula Mixed-Membership Stochastic Blockmodel - is introduced in this paper for modeling intra-group correlations, namely an individual Copula function jointly models the membership pairs of those nodes within the group of interest. This framework enables various Copula functions to be used on demand, while maintaining the membership indicator's marginal distribution needed for modelling membership indicators with other nodes outside of the group of interest. Sampling algorithms for both the finite and infinite number of groups are also detailed.

    "abstract": "The performance of deep neural networks is well-known to be sensitive to the setting of their hyperparameters. Recent advances in reverse-mode automatic differentiation allow for optimizing hyperparameters with gradients. The standard way of computing these gradients involves a forward and backward pass of computations. However, the backward pass usually needs to consume unaffordable memory to store all the intermediate variables to exactly reverse the forward training procedure. In this work we propose a simple but effective method, DrMAD, to distill the knowledge of the forward pass into a shortcut path, through which we approximately reverse the training trajectory. Experiments on several image benchmark datasets show that DrMAD is at least 45 times faster and consumes 100 times less memory compared to state-of-the-art methods for optimizing hyperparameters with minimal compromise to its effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, DrMAD is the first research attempt to make it practical to automatically tune thousands of hyperparameters of deep neural networks.

We also adopt a variance-reducing gradient method to improve PGRD's performance. The new method improves UCT's performance on multiple ATARI games compared to UCT without the reward bonus.

This limitation hinders the full utilization of labeled instances for learning a more precise hashing model. To overcome this limitation, we propose a class-wise supervised hashing method that trains a model based on a class-pairwise similarity matrix, whose size is much smaller than the instance-pairwise similarity matrix in many applications. In addition, besides a set of hash functions, our proposed method learns a set of classwise code-prototypes with active bits for different classes.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the task of change detection from noisy multivariate time-series data. One major feature of our approach is to leverage directional statistics as the noise-robust signature of time-series data. To capture major patterns, we introduce a regularized maximum likelihood equation for the von Mises-Fisher distribution, which simultaneously learns directional statistics and sample weights to filter out unwanted samples contaminated by the noise. We show that the optimization problem is reduced to the trust region subproblem in a certain limit, where global optimality is guaranteed. To evaluate the amount of changes, we introduce a novel distance measure on the Stiefel manifold. The method is validated with real-world data from an ore mining system",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Knowledge transfer between tasks can improve the performance of learned models, but requires an accurate estimate of the inter-task relationships to identify the relevant knowledge to transfer. These inter-task relationships are typically estimated based on training data for each task, which is inefficient in lifelong learning settings where the goal is to learn each consecutive task rapidly from as little data as possible. To reduce this burden, we develop a lifelong reinforcement learning method based on coupled dictionary learning that incorporates high-level task descriptors to model the inter-task relationships. We show that using task descriptors improves the performance of the learned task policies, providing both theoretical justification for the benefit and empirical demonstration of the improvement across a variety of dynamical control problems. Given only the descriptor for a new task, the lifelong learner is also able to accurately predict the task policy through zero-shot learning using the coupled dictionary, eliminating the need to pause to gather training data before addressing the task",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Multi-label learning has been extensively studied in the area of bioinformatics, information retrieval, multimedia annotation, etc. In multi-label learning, each instance is associated with multiple interdependent class labels, the label information can be noisy and incomplete. In addition, multi-labeled data often has noisy, irrelevant and redundant features of high dimensionality. As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its effectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for numerous data mining and machine learning tasks. Most of existing multi-label feature selection algorithms either boil down to solving multiple single-labeled feature selection problems or directly make use of imperfect labels. Therefore, they may not be able to find discriminative features that are shared by multiple labels. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label informed feature selection framework MIFS, which exploits label correlations to select discriminative features across multiple labels. Specifically, to reduce the negative effects of imperfect label information in finding label correlations, we decompose the multi-label information into a low-dimensional space and then employ the reduced space to steer the feature selection process.

In this paper, we consider planning with accurate models and investigate structural properties of MDPs that bound the loss incurred by using smaller than specified planning horizons. We identify a number of structural parameters some of which depend on the reward function alone, some on the transition dynamics alone, and some that depend on the interaction between rewards and transition dynamics. We provide planning loss bounds in terms of these structural parameters and, in some cases, also show tightness of the upper bounds.

But despite the high hopes raised by this new class of algorithms, their practical impact is still below expectations. One reason for this is the difficulty in adapting spectral methods to exploit structural constraints about different target environments which can be known beforehand. A natural structure intrinsic to many dynamical systems is a multi-resolution behaviour where interesting phenomena occur at different time scales during the evolution of the system. In this paper we introduce the multi-step predictive state representation (M-PSR) and an associated learning algorithm that finds and leverages frequent patterns of observations at multiple scales in dynamical systems with discrete observations. We perform experiments on robot exploration tasks in a wide variety of environments and conclude that the use of M-PSRs improves over the classical PSR for varying amounts of data, environment sizes, and number of observations symbols",

To this end, we propose a Relaxed Ranking-based Factor Model, RRFM, to relax pairwise ranking into a SVM-like task, where positive and negative feedbacks are separated by the soft boundaries, and their non-separate property is employed to capture the characteristic of unobserved data.

We present adversarial sequence tagging, a consistent structured prediction framework for minimizing Hamming loss by pessimistically viewing uncertainty.

This paper proposes a novel approach, named joint Feature Selection and Structure Preservation (FSSP), for unsupervised domain adaptation.

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel MKC algorithm with a \"local\" kernel alignment, which only requires that the similarity of a sample to its k-nearest neighbours be aligned with the ideal similarity matrix. Such an alignment helps the clustering algorithm to focus on closer sample pairs that shall stay together and avoids involving unreliable similarity evaluation for farther sample pairs. We derive a new optimization problem to implement this idea, and design a two-step algorithm to efficiently solve it. As experimentally demonstrated on six challenging multiple kernel learning benchmark data sets, our algorithm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art comparable methods in the recent literature, verifying the effectiveness and superiority of maximizing local kernel alignment",

To this end, it is desired to judge the quality of graph and develop performance-safe GSSL methods. In this paper we propose a large margin separation method 'Lead' for safe GSSL. Our basic idea is that, if a certain graph owns a high quality, its predictive results on unlabeled data may have a large margin separation. We should exploit the large margin graphs while keeping the small margin graphs (which might be risky) to be rarely exploited.

Such CNN models are extremely powerful to deal with massive amounts of training data by using millions and billions of parameters. However, these models are typically deficient due to the heavy cost in model storage, which prohibits their usage on resource-limited applications like mobile or embedded devices. In this paper, we target at compressing CNN models to an extreme without significantly losing their discriminability. Our main idea is to explicitly model the output reconstruction error between the original and compressed CNNs, which error is minimized to pursuit a satisfactory rate-distortion after compression. In particular, a global error reconstruction method termed GER is presented, which firstly leverages an SVD-based low-rank approximation to coarsely compress the parameters in the fully connected layers in a layer-wise manner. Subsequently, such layer-wise initial compressions are jointly optimized in a global perspective via back-propagation. The proposed GER method is evaluated on the ILSVRC2012 image classification benchmark, with implementations on two widely-adopted convolutional neural networks, i.e. the AlexNet and VGGNet-19. Comparing to several state-of-the-art and alternative methods of CNN compression, the proposed scheme has demonstrated the best rate-distortion performance on both networks",

In particular, we propose to learn a network embedding with the follower-ship/followee-ship of each user explicitly modeled as input/output context vector representations so as to preserve the proximity of users with \"similar\" followers/followees in the embedded space. For the alignment, we add both known and potential anchor users across the networks to facilitate the transfer of context information across networks. We solve both the network embedding problem and the user alignment problem simultaneously under a unified optimization framework. The stochastic gradient descent and negative sampling algorithms are used to address scalability issues. Extensive experiments on real social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared with several state-of-the-art methods",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Consider a binary classification problem in which the learner is given a labeled training set, an unlabeled test set, and is restricted to choosing exactly k test points to output as positive predictions. Problems of this kind — transductive precision@k — arise in many applications. Previous methods solve these problems in two separate steps, learning the model and selecting k test instances by thresholding their scores. In this way, model training is not aware of the constraint of choosing k test instances as positive in the test phase. This paper shows the importance of incorporating the knowledge of k into the learning process and introduces a new approach, Transductive Top K (TTK), that seeks to minimize the hinge loss over all training instances under the constraint that exactly k test instances are predicted as positive. The paper presents two optimization methods for this challenging problem. Experiments and analysis confirm the benefit of incoporating k in the learning process. In our experimental evaluations, the performance of TTK matches or exceeds existing state-of-the-art methods on 7 benchmark datasets for binary classification and 3 reserve design problem instances",

    "abstract": "Among learning-based hashing methods, supervised hashing tries to find hash codes which preserve semantic similarities of original data. Recent years have witnessed much efforts devoted to design objective functions and optimization methods for supervised hashing learning, in order to improve search accuracy and reduce training cost. In this paper, we propose a very straightforward supervised hashing algorithm and demonstrate its superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. The key idea of our approach is to treat label vectors as binary codes and to learn target codes which have similar structure to label vectors. To circumvent direct optimization on large Gram matrices, we identify an inner-product-preserving transformation and use it to bring close label vectors and hash codes without changing the structure. The optimization process is very efficient and scales well. In our experiment, training 16-bit and 96-bit code on NUS-WIDE cost respectively only 3 and 6 minutes",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Outliers are ubiquitous in modern data sets. Distance-based techniques are a popular non-parametric approach to outlier detection as they require no prior assumptions on the data generating distribution and are simple to implement. Scaling these techniques to massive data sets without sacrificing accuracy is a challenging task. We propose a novel algorithm based on the intuition that outliers have a significant influence on the quality of divergence-based clustering solutions. We propose sensitivity - the worst-case impact of a data point on the clustering objective - as a measure of outlierness. We then prove that influence - a (non-trivial) upper-bound on the sensitivity can be computed by a simple linear time algorithm. To scale beyond a single machine, we propose a communication efficient distributed algorithm. In an extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness and establish the statistical significance of the proposed approach. In particular, it outperforms the most popular distance-based approaches while being several orders of magnitude faster",

    "title": "Avoiding Optimal Mean Robust PCA",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Robust principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most important dimension reduction techniques to handle high-dimensional data with outliers. However, the existing robust PCA presupposes that the mean of the data is zero and incorrectly utilizes the Euclidean distance based optimal mean for robust PCA with &ell;1-norm. Some studies consider this issue and integrate the estimation of the optimal mean into the dimension reduction objective, which leads to expensive computation.In this paper, we equivalently reformulate the maximization of variances for robust PCA, such that the optimal projection directions are learned by maximizing the sum of the projected difference between each pair of instances, rather than the difference between each instance and the mean of the data.Based on this reformulation, we propose a novel robust PCA to automatically avoid the calculation of the optimal mean based on &ell;1-norm distance. This strategy also makes the assumption of centered data unnecessary. Additionally, we intuitively extend the proposed robust PCA to its 2D version for image recognition. Efficient non-greedy algorithms are exploited to solve the proposed robust PCA and 2D robust PCA with fast convergence and low computational complexity.Some experimental results on benchmark data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approaches on image reconstruction and recognition",

    "title": "On Combining Side Information and Unlabeled Data for Heterogeneous Multi-Task Metric Learning",
    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Distance metric learning (DML) is critical for a wide variety of machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition applications. Transfer metric learning (TML) leverages the side information (e.g., similar/dissimilar constraints over pairs of samples) from related domains to help the target metric learning (with limited information). Current TML tools usually assume that different domains exploit the same feature representation, and thus are not applicable to tasks where data are drawn from heterogeneous domains. Heterogeneous transfer learning approaches handle heterogeneous domains by usually learning feature transformations across different domains. The learned transformation can be used to derive a metric, but these approaches are mostly limited by their capability of only handling two domains. This motivates the proposed heterogeneous multi-task metric learning (HMTML) framework for handling multiple domains by combining side information and unlabeled data. Specifically, HMTML learns the metrics for all different domains simultaneously by maximizing their high-order correlation (parameterized by feature covariance of unlabeled data) in a common subspace, which is induced by the transformations derived from the metrics. Extensive experiments on both multi-language text categorization and multi-view social image annotation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method",

    "volume": "main",
    "abstract": "Large-scale customer service call records include lots of valuable information for business intelligence. However, the analysis of those records has not utilized in the big data era before. There are two fundamental problems before mining and analyses: 1) The telephone conversation is mixed with words of agents and users which have to be recognized before analysis; 2) The speakers in conversation are not in a pre-defined set. These problems are new challenges which have not been well studied in the previous work. In this paper, we propose a four-phase framework for role labeling in real customer service telephone conversation, with the benefit of integrating multi-modality features, i.e., both low-level acoustic features and semantic-level textual features. Firstly, we conduct ΔBayesian Information Criterion (ΔBIC) based speaker diarization to get two segments clusters from an audio stream. Secondly, the segments are transferred into text in an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) phase with a deep learning model DNN-HMM. Thirdly, by integrating acoustic and textual features, dialog level role labeling is proposed to map the two clusters into the agent and the user. Finally, sentence level role correction is designed in order to label results correctly in a fine-grained notion, which reduces the errors made in previous phases. The proposed framework is tested on two real datasets: mobile and bank customer service calls datasets. The precision of dialog level labeling is over 99.0%. On the sentence level, the accuracy of labeling reaches 90.4%, greatly outperforming traditional acoustic features based method which achieves only 78.5% in accuracy",

One challenging problem is: whether and to what extent we can address the anchor link prediction problem, if only structural information of networks is available. Most existing methods, unsupervised or supervised, directly work on networks themselves rather than on their intrinsic structural regularities, and thus their effectiveness is sensitive to the high dimension and sparsity of networks. To offer a robust method, we propose a novel supervised model, called PALE, which employs network embedding with awareness of observed anchor links as supervised information to capture the major and specific structural regularities and further learns a stable cross-network mapping for predicting anchor links. Through extensive experiments on two realistic datasets, we demonstrate that PALE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods",

    "abstract": "A fundamental artificial intelligence challenge is how to design agents that intelligently trade off exploration and exploitation while quickly learning about an unknown environment. However, in order to learn quickly, we must somehow generalize experience across states. One promising approach is to use Bayesian methods to simultaneously cluster dynamics and control exploration; unfortunately, these methods tend to require computationally intensive MCMC approximation techniques which lack guarantees. We propose Thompson Clustering for Reinforcement Learning (TCRL), a family of Bayesian clustering algorithms for reinforcement learning that leverage structure in the state space to remain computationally efficient while controlling both exploration and generalization. TCRL-Theoretic achieves near-optimal Bayesian regret bounds while consistently improving over a standard Bayesian exploration approach. TCRL-Relaxed is guaranteed to converge to acting optimally, and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian clustering algorithms across a variety of simulated domains, even in cases where no states are similar",

Lately, multi-view maximum entropy discrimination (MVMED) and alternative MVMED (AMVMED) were proposed as extensions of maximum entropy discrimination (MED) to the multi-view learning setting, which use the hard margin consistency principle that enforces two view margins to be the same. In this paper, we propose soft margin consistency based multi-view MED (SMVMED) achieving margin consistency in a less strict way, which minimizes the relative entropy between the posteriors of two view margins. With a trade-off parameter balancing large margin and margin consistency, SMVMED is more flexible. We also propose a sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm to efficiently train SMVMED and make it scalable to large datasets. We evaluate the performance of SMVMED on multiple real-world datasets and get encouraging results",
