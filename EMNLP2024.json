    "abstract": "We study the integration of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) from clinical study into a joint predictive model. Compared to the totally black-box models, a competitive model with explainable structure is much more desirable. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel Gaussian Matrix Graphical Encoder(GMGE) based on matrix normal graphical model to encode unstructured medical text and simultaneously learn the underlying conditional dependency graph of concepts. We further present DiMES, a Diagnostic Model with Explainable Structure, which integrates the concept graph generated by GMGE with structured data such as patient's physical examination measures. Utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), DiMES encodes patient features based on the concept graph for downstream tasks, providing clinicians with accurate predictive information to assist in diagnostic decisions and treatment plan design. The effectiveness of the proposed DiMES is validated through its application on four downstream diagnostic predictive tasks(ACL, PCL, MMI and PS)",

    "title": "Rethinking Pragmatics in Large Language Models: Towards Open-Ended Evaluation and Preference Tuning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges of assessing and enhancing social-pragmatic inference in large language models (LLMs). We first highlight the inadequacy of current accuracy-based multiple choice question answering (MCQA) formats in assessing social-pragmatic reasoning, and propose the direct evaluation of models' free-form responses as measure, which - as our results show - correlates better with human judgement. Further, we explore the enhancement of pragmatic abilities in LLMs, proposing the use of preference optimization (PO) over supervised finetuning (SFT) since there's no ``gold'' answer in responding to a social situation. Our results indicate that preferential tuning significantly outperforms and proves more robust than SFT across pragmatic phenomena, and offers a near-free launch to enhance models' pragmatic ability without compromising generic abilities. Lastly, we delve into LLMs' internal space and demonstrate that the substantial boost of the model's pragmatic reasoning capabilities is linked to deeper layer representation, mirroring human's high-level thinking. Our experiments span multiple pragmatic and social reasoning data sources, covering diverse phenomena, as well as a image referential game requiring multimodal theory of mind (ToM). With our refined paradigms for evaluating and enhancing pragmatic inference, this paper offers key insights for developing more socially aware language models",

    "abstract": "In low-resource settings, the problem is often not only the amount of data available, but also the quality, and in ways that are entirely foreign to high-resourced languages. For instance, many extreme low-resource languages have only recently acquired writing systems. This may result in multiple writing systems competing for dominance or, within a single writing system, non-standardized spelling. Translating to and from low-resource languages is a challenge for machine translation (MT) systems due to a lack of suitable parallel data. In this case study, we focus on the impact of manual data cleaning on the performance of learning machine translation models. We focus on Bambara, the vehicular language of Mali, and introduce the largest curated dataset for multilingual translation. We finetune six commonly used transformer-based language models, i.e., AfriMBART, AfriMT5, AfriM2M100, Mistral, Open-Llama-7B, and Meta-Llama3-8B on three existing Bambara-French language pair datasets and our curated dataset. We show that our new aligned and curated multilingual dataset enhances the translation quality of all studied models using the BLEU, CHRF++, and AfriCOMET evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "Procedural texts, such as recipes and instruction manuals, are crucial for understanding processes involving multiple entities over time. Entity state tracking, which monitors the states of specific entities at each time step, is a key task in this domain. However, existing benchmarks heavily rely on manually annotated datasets, limiting scalability. We propose a novel task of step image generation in recipes, using step images as visual supervision for tracking entity states in procedural text without relying on manually annotated data. By generating step images, we can visualize the entity states in each step. For this task, we collect high-quality multimodal recipe datasets, theSpruceEats. Addressing the limitation of existing two-stage methods in achieving deep interaction between text and image, this paper introduces an explicit state modeling approach based on multimodal generative models. Experiments on theSpruceEats dataset demonstrate that our method enhance entity state tracking and image generation quality compared to existing methods, improving the CLIP similarity metric by 10.2% compared to existing methods",

Secondly, by introducing refinement layers, we allow interactions between arc representations, facilitating interactions between arcs.

Our experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a smaller number of output classes",

    "abstract": "Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE Transformers underperform vanilla Transformers in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific distillation method and conduct experiments on the BERT architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability distillation.

Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to construct tasks to comprehensively evaluate the robustness against format changes of MCQs by decomposing the answering process into several steps. Using this dataset, we evaluate six LLMs, such as Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Consequently, the lack of robustness to differences in the format of MCQs becomes evident.

Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism",

Our study reveals three primary findings: (i) Despite these factors significantly influencing overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, while others show high resistance. (ii) The sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by their Complexity and Transference, which indicate the relative importance of each factor in learning specific abilities.

We discover that the difference in scores assigned to response pairs by the reward model effectively indicates the quality of data, and data of varying qualities show significant distinctions in reward model training.

Although current LLMs are achieving increasingly better performance on various benchmarks, their performance in practical applications does not always match their benchmark results. Leakage of benchmarks can prevent the accurate assessment of LLMs' true performance. However, constructing new benchmarks is costly, labor-intensive and still carries the risk of leakage. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question Can we reuse these leaked benchmarks for LLM evaluation? We propose Inference-Time Decontamination (ITD) to address this issue by detecting and rewriting leaked samples without altering their difficulties. ITD can mitigate performance inflation caused by memorizing leaked benchmarks. Our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that ITD reduces inflated accuracy by 22.9\\% on GSM8K and 19.0\\% on MMLU. On MMLU, using Inference-time Decontamination can lead to a decrease in the results of Phi3 and Mistral by 6.7\\% and 3.6\\% respectively.

Despite high success rates on current benchmarks, however, these often feature simple problems with only one or two unknowns, which do not sufficiently challenge their reasoning capacities. This paper introduces a novel benchmark, BeyondX, designed to address these limitations by incorporating problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing the challenges in proposing multi-unknown problems from scratch, we developed BeyondX using an innovative automated pipeline that progressively increases complexity by expanding the number of unknowns in simpler problems. Empirical study on BeyondX reveals that the performance of existing LLMs, even those fine-tuned specifically on math tasks, significantly decreases as the number of unknowns increases - with a performance drop of up to 70% observed in GPT-4. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Formulate-and-Solve strategy, a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of unknowns.

However, DPO requires paired preference data which is harder and more expensive to obtain compared to binary preference data. We propose a retrieval-based method named Retrieval-DPO to align LLMs under binary preference data situation. The core idea of our method is that learning how to align can be achieved with non-paired preference data of similar questions rather than strictly paired preference data considering the learning process of human. For instance, to teach the LLM to learn how to treat multiple perspectives, other comprehensive golden answers of similar question may have similar positive effects as the golden answer of the same question. Following this idea, we retrieve an example with opposite label from the retrieval database for a binary preference data in the training set. After the retrieval process, we get a pair of preference data but with possibly different questions and then adopt the DOVE \\cite{bansal2024comparing} optimization objective for the alignment. We compare Retrieval-DPO with other preference optimization algorithms which do not need paired preference data such as Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Unified Language Model Alignment (ULMA). We find that our method significantly outperforms KTO and ULMA on helpful-base subset of HH dataset (over 13\\%) and slightly outperforms KTO on harmless-base subset of HH dataset and controlled sentiment generation task.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using preference datasets, enabling the LLM to generate outputs that align with human preferences. Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBisuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBisuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training",

Solving these puzzles necessitates inferring aspects of a language's grammatical structure from a small number of examples. Such puzzles provide a natural testbed for language models, as they require compositional generalization and few-shot inductive reasoning. Consisting solely of new puzzles written specifically for this work, ModeLing has no risk of appearing in the training data of existing AI systems: this ameliorates the risk of data leakage, a potential confounder for many prior evaluations of reasoning. Evaluating several large open source language models and GPT on our benchmark, we observe non-negligible accuracy, demonstrating few-shot emergent reasoning ability which cannot merely be attributed to shallow memorization. However, imperfect model performance suggests that ModeLing can be used to measure further progress in linguistic reasoning",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable generalizability in various domains. Despite their extensive knowledge, LLMs still face challenges in efficiently utilizing encoded knowledge to develop accurate and logical reasoning. To mitigate this problem, we introduced the Hint-before-Solving framework (HinSo), which guides the model in generating hints (e.g., specific knowledge or key ideas) for solving the problem before the step-by-step solution. Our studies involving 5 LLMs across 7 datasets of mathematical and commonsense reasoning results indicated that introducing hints before problem-solving can significantly enhance the performance of CoT. To investigate whether LLMs can learn the HinSo pattern and improve their generalization ability, we constructed two large-scale and high-quality training datasets, HST-S and HST-L, containing 7.5k and 75k samples, respectively. The experimental results of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) showed that, under the same settings, the performance of model trained on the HinSo-formatted data improved significantly compared to CoT-formatted data, with a performance increase of 5.1% and 5.6% on the GSM8K, respectively.

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to fill the gap between programming languages and natural language, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model.

Secondly, it includes negative text and images created through fine-grained editing and generation based on existing data, thereby testing the model's ability to correctly reject scenarios where the target object is not visible in the imageâ€”an essential aspect often overlooked in existing datasets and approaches. Utilizing this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art specialist models and MLLMs. Our findings indicate that there remains a significant gap in achieving satisfactory grounding performance.

    "abstract": "Lexical Constrained Generation (LCG) is a fundamental task in text generation. Recent advancement of large pretrained language models (LLMs) has enabled prompt-based controlling for LCG. Despite growing interest in assessing LLMs' capabilities in various aspects, there remains a lack of thorough investigation. To address this gap, we systematically analyze the performance of LLMs on satisfying lexical constraints with prompt-based controlling, as well as their efficacy in downstream applications (such as recipe generation, table-to-text, profile writing, etc). Through extensive experimentation, we identified several key observations that elucidate the limitations of LLMs in LCG, including (1) position bias, where LLMs tend to satisfy constraints that appear in specific positions within the input; (2) insensitive decoding parameters, which minimally impact the performance of LLMs; and (3) the inherent complexity of certain constraints (i.e. compound word). We conclude that there is a complexity bottleneck: LLMs still face significant challenges in consistently satisfying lexical constraints. Additionally, we introduce the Divide and Conquer Generation strategy, effective for both white-box and black-box LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance in LCG tasks. This strategy boosts LLMs' success rate by 93% in the most challenging LCG task, which is 40% more than the baseline. Our analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of LLMs in LCG, and our proposed strategy offers a pathway to more sophisticated and customized text generation applications",

In India, where \"transgender\" was legally recognised as a category only in 2014, and sameâ€“sex marriages are yet to be legalised, it becomes crucial to analyse whether and how news media reported the lived realities of vulnerable LGBTQ+ communities during the pandemic. This study analysed articles from online editions of two Englishâ€“language newspaper websites, which differed vastly in their circulation figuresâ€”The Times of India and The Indian Express. The results of our study suggest that these newspaper websites covered articles surrounding various aspects of the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals with a greater focus on transgender communities. However, they lacked quality and depth. Focusing on the period spanning March 2020 to August 2021, we analysed articles from The Times of India and The Indian Express using distilâ€“RoBERTaâ€“base and ChatGPTâ€“3.5 for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modelling. We also compared our results to the period before the pandemic (January 2019â€“December 2019) to understand the shift in topics and sentiments across the two newspaper websites. Our topic modelling results indicate that The Times of India and The Indian Express primarily wrote soft news on LGBTQ+ communities. Similarly, our sentiment analysis results indicate a difference in prevailing sentiment as depicted by the two models. Furthermore, our manual analysis of the articles indicates that the language used in certain articles by The Times of India was transphobic and obsolete. Our study captures the visibility and representation of the LGBTQ+ communities in online Indian news media outlets, the language they use, and the narratives they follow",

Quantization techniques have emerged as a promising avenue for addressing these challenges while preserving accuracy and making energy efficient. We propose CPTQuant, a comprehensive strategy that introduces correlation-based (CMPQ), pruning-based (PMPQ), and Taylor decomposition-based (TDMPQ) mixed precision techniques. CMPQ adapts the precision level based on canonical correlation analysis of different layers. PMPQ optimizes precision layer-wise based on their sensitivity to sparsity. TDMPQ modifies precision using Taylor decomposition to assess each layer's sensitivity to input perturbation. These strategies allocate higher precision to more sensitive layers while diminishing precision to robust layers. CPTQuant assesses the performance across BERT, OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B, and OPT-2.7B. We demonstrate up to 4x compression and a 2x-fold increase in efficiency with minimal accuracy drop compared to Hugging Face FP16. PMPQ stands out for achieving a considerably higher model compression. Sensitivity analyses across various LLMs show that the initial and final 30% of layers exhibit higher sensitivities than the remaining layers.

    "title": "Solving the Inverse Alignment Problem for Efficient RLHF",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the ``inverse alignment problem'' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy",

    "title": "SedarEval: Automated Evaluation using Self-Adaptive Rubrics",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called INSDA, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. INSDA consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach",

    "abstract": "Causal graph recovery is traditionally done using statistical estimation-based methods or based on individual's knowledge about variables of interests. They often suffer from data collection biases and limitations of individuals' knowledge. The advance of large language models (LLMs) provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that leverages LLMs to deduce causal relationships in general causal graph recovery tasks. This method leverages knowledge compressed in LLMs and knowledge LLMs extracted from scientific publication database as well as experiment data about factors of interest to achieve this goal. Our method gives a prompting strategy to extract associational relationships among those factors and a mechanism to perform causality verification for these associations. Comparing to other LLM-based methods that directly instruct LLMs to do the highly complex causal reasoning, our method shows clear advantage on causal graph quality on benchmark datasets. More importantly, as causality among some factors may change as new research results emerge, our method show sensitivity to new evidence in the literature and can provide useful information for updating causal graphs accordingly",

    "title": "TALEC: Teach Your LLM to Evaluate in Specific Domain with In-house Criteria by Criteria Division and Zero-shot Plus Few-shot",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text gener- ation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in spe- cific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation cri- teria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and busi- ness security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house cri- teria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to ad- just and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a cor- relation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks",

    "title": "On the Fragility of Active Learners for Text Classification",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) techniques optimally utilize a labeling budget by iteratively selecting instances that are most valuable for learning. However, they lack \"prerequisite checks\", i.e., there are no prescribed criteria to pick an AL algorithm best suited for a dataset. A practitioner must pick a technique they \\emph{trust} would beat random sampling, based on prior reported results, and hope that it is resilient to the many variables in their environment: dataset, labeling budget and prediction pipelines. The important questions then are: how often on average, do we expect any AL technique to reliably beat the computationally cheap and easy-to-implement strategy of random sampling? Does it at least make sense to use AL in an ``Always ON'' mode in a prediction pipeline, so that while it might not always help, it never under-performs random sampling? How much of a role does the prediction pipeline play in AL's success? We examine these questions in detail for the task of text classification using pre-trained representations, which are ubiquitous today. Our primary contribution here is a rigorous evaluation of AL techniques, old and new, across setups that vary wrt datasets, text representations and classifiers. This unlocks multiple insights around warm-up times, i.e., number of labels before gains from AL are seen, viability of an ``Always ON'' mode and the relative significance of different factors. Additionally, we release a framework for rigorous benchmarking of AL techniques for text classification",

Grounded in the analysis of real-world data from a linguistic perspective, we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs. For such intricate text style transfer, we further propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to analyze the characteristics and identify the problems of stylized texts. Comprehensive experiments suggest that current LLMs struggle to generate public speaking texts that align with human preferences, primarily due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information.

    "title": "On the Universal Truthfulness Hyperplane Inside LLMs",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate inaccurate responses -- this can be particularly dangerous in sensitive areas like medicine and healthcare. Current methods for detecting hallucinations involve sampling answers multiple times, making them computationally intensive. In this study, we introduce HalluCheck, a novel hallucination detection module that identifies factual elements or atomic facts within a text. HalluCheck operates on the premise that responses to questions probing factual answers should be consistent both within a single LLM and across different LLMs. To improve system robustness, we incorporate a token-probability-based double-check mechanism. For hallucinated facts, inconsistencies or a lack of model confidence during generation will be evident. We evaluate our detection module on fact-based datasets such as NQ\\_Open, HotpotQA, and WebQ, by building upon open-source LLMs such as LLaMa-2 (7B)-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Finally, we compare the generated output with the correct answers to determine sentence-level AUC-ROC scores for hallucination detection. Our results demonstrate that HalluCheck can (i) detect hallucinated facts and (ii) achieve significantly higher AUC-ROC scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions, specifically those that do not utilize external databases for hallucination detection",

    "abstract": "Efficient decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) for intricate tasks is impeded by the substantial inference cost. The prevailing search algorithms tend to focus solely on performance enhancement, ignoring the cost-effectiveness trade-off. To address these challenges, we first utilize the 3E Criteria to systematically evaluate the cost-benefit balance of current search strategies. We found current methods typically sacrifice vast efficiency for marginal improvement of effectiveness. In order to empower LLMs effective decision-making capability with balanced efficiency, we present a plug-and-play framework with Speculative Reward Model (SRM), which leverages external reward assigner to speculate the preferential actions, not just rely on self-evaluation inside LLMs. Through speculative verification approach for pruning and efficient navigation toward more promising steps, SRM boosts decision-making ability of LLM cost-effectively. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning for specific fields. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SRM for inference efficiency, which significantly lowers cost to a fraction of the original search framework's by 1/10 on average, without sacrificing effectiveness",

    "abstract": "Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo.

We introduce a new metrics RIG (raw information gain) in order to do so. Any LLM (large language model) could be considered a \"black box\" of compressed information. It is hard to measure what amount of information is stored inside the model regarding any domain. The contrast between the size of a trained model of around 43GB compared to 15 trillion tokens of training data is staggering The other issue is to figure out where do the limits come from: is it an architectural constraint or is the limitation coming from the data used in training. So far the most common way to identify if the model is properly trained and contains necessary information is to put it through a list of benchmarks and the decision is based on either it's ranking or some educated guess of a score threshold. Keeping in mind that the most of those benchmarks become part of training data for upcoming models we face a vicious cycle of never ending benchmark creation. Taken into account constant size growth of both language models and datasets we face an challenge of losing a track of what is efficient and what is not to train models as well as simple scale of the datasets makes them almost impossible to supervise at all, what is an immense obstacle when we need to update any language model according to different environments those are implemented at and we need to bring ethical issues, actuality of the human knowledge and controversial statements altogether",

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss",

Our findings indicate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models struggle with concept structure reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o averages a score of 62.1\\%).

To address these limitations, we investigate whether LLMs can generate meta-feedback that pinpoints errors in the feedback rather than the response.While the ability of LLMs to generate self-feedback has been well-researched, their potential to provide constructive meta-feedback remains under-explored. We design a novel self-correction prompting framework, Feedback-on-Feedback (FoF), which leverages meta-feedback to improve the feedback before refining the response. Our framework first samples multiple feedbacks for the initial response, and prompts the LLM to generate a meta-feedback that analyze the inconsistency between these feedbacks. Based on the meta-feedback, the LLM generates a refined feedback that subsequently guides the revision of the response.

    "abstract": "Long-context modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention, leading to the emergence of LLMs with ultra-context windows. Meanwhile, benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models are gradually catching up. However, existing benchmarks employ irrelevant noise texts to artificially extend the length of test cases, diverging from the real-world scenarios of long-context applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel long-context benchmark, Loong, aligning with realistic scenarios through extended multi-document question answering (QA). Unlike typical document QA, in Loong's test cases, each document is relevant to the final answer, ignoring any document will lead to the failure of the answer. Furthermore, Loong introduces four types of tasks with a range of context lengths: Spotlight Locating, Comparison, Clustering, and Chain of Reasoning, to facilitate a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of long-context understanding. Extensive experiments indicate that existing long-context language models still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) achieves poor performance, demonstrating that Loong can reliably assess the model's long-context modeling capabilities",

However, recent studies have highlighted that the dynamicity inherent in real-world environments poses significant challenges to the decision-making abilities of LLM agents, making the investigation of LLM decision-making boundaries in dynamic environments an urgent and formidable task. Current evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on assessing LLM decision-making performance in static and interactive environments, which significantly differ from the dynamicity present in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, existing evaluation frameworks lack fine-grained assessments of LLMs' capabilities, providing limited insights during the evaluation process and hindering a comprehensive understanding of the models' capabilities.

FD-Bench employs a fire evacuation scenario as a representative dynamic setting, offering a generalized evaluation framework and a step-wise evaluation strategy to comprehensively analyze and capture variations in decision-making abilities.

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have shown greater capability in translating figurative language compared to state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and combining NMTs and LLMs on idiom translation remains unexplored.

Using these datasets, we evaluate GPT models, Google Translate, and their combination, focusing on idiom translation accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance. Additionally, we assess existing automatic evaluation metrics and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for evaluating idiomatic translations. Our results indicate that while Google Translate shows superior fluency, GPT-3.5 excels in accurately translating idioms. We also show that models are better at translating English idioms than Persian ones, and different configurations of models perform differently depending on the direction of translation.

Nevertheless, LLMs typically require orders of magnitude more data than children, and language outcomes cannot be directly compared. Here, we introduce \\textit{machine-CDI}, a metric based on the learner's output to enable a direct comparison of machines and infants on their expressive vocabulary as a function of input quantity. This metric adapts the Communicative Development Inventories \\citep{fenson2007macarthur,frank2017wordbank}, a normalized inventory of words to quantify child language development, to the evaluation set of language models. We illustrate machine-CDI by comparing the expressive vocabulary in infants and character language models (LSTMs and Transformers) trained on English audiobooks. The results show that language models approximately match the children's learning curves, although Transformers are delayed compared to LSTMs. A further analysis show that the models are more impacted by word frequency than children, with a large delay in acquiring low frequency words for models. This delay is found to be linked to the more general phenomenon of long tail truncation observed in language models, which makes them unable to learn words based on few shot observations. These results shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlights important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process natural language",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "In-context learning has become a standard learning paradigm for language models. However, current prompt engineering methods, which function within the token space, may restrict their effectiveness. We propose to explore the potential of activation space through Iterative Context Vectors (ICVs), a technique aimed at improving task performance without backpropagation. ICVs are employed by first extracting and iteratively refining activations within a language model, then applying them during inference with minimal computational and memory overhead. We evaluate ICVs across a range of tasks using various models and observe significant improvements. Our findings suggest that activation steering can serve as a promising direction for in-context learning, thereby opening new avenues for future research",

    "abstract": "With the rise in social media (SM) platforms that offer easy access, community formation, and online debate, the issue of hate speech has risen rapidly. The hate detection, and countering it becomes a growing challenge to society, researchers, companies, and policymakers. Hate speech is in the form of text or multimodal such as memes, GIFs, audio, or video. The scientific study of hate speech from a computer science view has gained attention in recent years. Mostly it is considered a supervised task where the annotated corpora and shared resources play a big role. To combat it, SM, employing modern AI tools is getting attention. This survey comprehensively examines the work done to combat hate in the English language so far. This structures the state-of-the-art methodologies employed for unimodal identification, studies conducted in multimodal hate identification, the role of Explainable AI, prevention of hate speech through style transfer, and counter-narrative generation for the English language. The efficacy and limitations are also discussed. Compared with the earlier surveys this paper concisely gives a well-organized presentation of the methods to combat hate",

    "abstract": "Preference optimization is a crucial aspect of generative models, ensuring that the generated content aligns with users' preferences. While previous research has focused on optimizing for average preferences, text-to-image tasks require a personalized approach due to the diversity of individual preferences. In this study, we propose a two-stage framework for personalized preference optimization in text-to-image generation. The first stage, personalized image aesthetic assessment (PIAA), learns user preferences from a small amount of user image rating data. The second stage, prompt optimization, optimizes the text-to-image model's prompt to generate images that receive high scores from the learned preference model. We employ Large Language Models (LLMs) for the prompt optimization process. Through extensive experimentation with various configurations in the PIAA and prompt optimization stages, we demonstrate that our approach can generate novel images that align with individual user preferences, even with limited user data. Our research lays the foundation for future work on personalized content generation",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of Large Language models, more and more jobs are being automated by using LLMs. Therefore, it is very important to assess the fairness of LLMs. Studies reveal the reflection of societal norms and biases in LLMs, which creates a risk of propagating societal stereotypes in downstream tasks. Numerous works have been done in various NLP applications regarding bias exhibition via LLMs and more so on gender bias. However there is a gap on the study of bias in emotional attributes, although human emotion and gender are closely related in societal discourse for almost all societies. The gap is even larger for a low resource language like Bangla. Historically women were more associated with emotional responses like empathy, fear or guilt, whereas men were more associated with anger, bravado, authority etc. This resonates with the societal system in areas where Bangla is prevalent. We offer the first thorough investigation of gendered emotion attribution in Bangla for both closed and open source LLMs in this work. Our aim is to elucidate the intricate societal relationship between gender and emotion specifically within the context of Bangla. All of our resources including code and data will be publicly available to support future research on Bangla NLP",

Developing tailored models for Document AI applications also demands substantial labeled data and high training costs. To address these challenges, we conducted experiments with various models, data types, architectures, and training methodologies.

    "abstract": "Most existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are constrained to support domain-specific questions, i.e., to train different models separately for different VQA tasks, thus generalizing poorly to others. For example, models trained on the reasoning-focused dataset GQA struggle to effectively handle samples from the knowledge-emphasizing dataset OKVQA. Meanwhile, in real-world scenarios, it is user-unfriendly to restrict the domain of questions. Therefore, this paper proposes a necessary task: One-to-Many Visual Question Answering, of which the ultimate goal is to enable a single model to answer as many different domains of questions as possible by the effective integration of available VQA resources. To this end, we first investigate into ten common VQA datasets, and break the task of VQA down into the integration of three key abilities. Then, considering assorted questions rely on different VQA abilities, this paper proposes a novel dynamic Mixture of LoRAs (MoL) strategy. MoL mixes three individually trained LoRA adapters (corresponding to each VQA ability) dynamically for different samples demanding various VQA abilities. The proposed MoL strategy is verified to be highly effective by experiments, establishing SOTAs on four datasets. In addition, MoL generalizes well to three extra zero-shot datasets.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from huge number of parameters, which restricts their deployment on edge devices. Weight sharing is one promising solution that encourages weight reuse, effectively reducing memory usage with less performance drop. However, current weight sharing techniques primarily focus on small-scale models like BERT and employ coarse-grained sharing rules, e.g., layer-wise. This becomes limiting given the prevalence of LLMs and sharing an entire layer or block obviously diminishes the flexibility of weight sharing. In this paper, we present a perspective on head-wise shareable attention for large language models. We further propose two memory-efficient methods that share parameters across attention heads, with a specific focus on LLMs. % to reduce the memory usage for large PLMs. Both of them use the same dynamic strategy to select the shared weight matrices. The first method directly reuses the pre-trained weights without retraining, denoted as $\\textbf{DirectShare}$. The second method first post-trains with constraint on weight matrix similarity and then shares, denoted as $\\textbf{PostShare}$.

    "abstract": "Due to the prohibitively expensive full fine-tuning costs of large language models (LLMs), various popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed. These methods majorly rely on fine-tuning few add-on modules, popularly referred to as {\\it adapters}, that corresponds to only \\textit{small fraction of LLM parameters}. In specific, low rank adaptation (LoRA), has demonstrated impressive parameter efficiency while yielding performance close to the full fine-tuning. However, classical LoRA may still fine-tune more parameters as compared to the inherent rank of the pre-trained weights \\cite{aghajanyan2020intrinsic}, leaving room for further parameter reduction. To mitigate this, only recently, few researches had proposed various freezing strategy of LoRA projection matrices, however, at the cost of additional FLOPs. To improve fine-tuning efficiency, in this work, we present ShareLoRA, that leverages a novel approach to use the redundancy in pre-trained model weights and share LoRA modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameter counts. In specific, \\autolora{} automatically finds the redundancy of the pre-trained weights and determines which LoRA adapters can share parameters. For this, \\autolora{} uses the similarity between representations to assess the information redundancy and a greedy algorithm to maximize the sharing of LoRA modules. We performed extensive evaluations with LLaMA family LLMs across various tasks.

Existing linear attention based models usually exploit decay factor based positional encoding (PE), where attention scores decay exponentially with increasing relative distance.

Our analysis reveals that direct training decay factor is unstable. To address this problem, we propose a novel PE for linear attention named Disentangle to Decay (D2D). D2D disentangles decay factor into two parts to achieve further optimization and stable training. Moreover, D2D can be transformed into recurrent form for efficient inference. Experiments demonstrate that D2D achieves stable training of decay factor, and enhances performance of linear attention in both normal context length and length extrapolation scenarios",

This arouses curiosity regarding the capacity of LLM agents to comprehend probability distributions, thereby guiding the agent's behavioral decision-making through probabilistic sampling and generating behavioral sequences. To answer the above question, we divide the problem into two main aspects: sequence simulation with known probability distribution and sequence simulation with unknown probability distribution.

SafeAligner leverages the disparity in security levels between the responses from these models to differentiate between harmful and beneficial tokens, effectively guiding the safety alignment by altering the output token distribution of the target model.

    "title": "Chain of Evidences and Evidence to Generate: Prompting for Context Grounded and Retrieval Augmented Reasoning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "While chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting has revolutionized how LLMs perform reasoning tasks, its current methods and variations (e.g, Self-consistency, ReACT, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Cumulative Reasoning (CR) etc.,) suffer from limitations like limited context grounding, hallucination/inconsistent output generation, and iterative sluggishness. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel mono/dual-step prompting framework built upon two unique strategies \\textbf{Chain of Evidences (CoE)} and \\textbf{Evidence to Generate (E2G)}. Instead of unverified reasoning claims, our innovative approaches leverage the power of \"evidence for decision making\" by first focusing exclusively on the thought sequences explicitly mentioned in the context which then serve as extracted evidence, guiding the LLM's output generation process with greater precision and efficiency. This simple yet potent approach unlocks the full potential of chain-of-thoughts prompting, facilitating faster, more reliable, and contextually aware reasoning in LLMs. Our framework consistently achieves remarkable results across various knowledge-intensive reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing baseline approaches with state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, (i) on the LogiQA benchmark using GPT-4, CoE achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 53.8\\%, surpassing CoT by 18\\%, ToT by 11\\%, and CR by 9\\%; (ii) CoE with PaLM-2 outperforms the variable-shot performance of Gemini Ultra by 0.9 F1 points, achieving an F1 score of 83.3 on DROP",

However, the setting of this task overlooks a significant portion of commonsense knowledge based on free-text in the real world, characterized by broad knowledge scope, long content and non instantiation. The editing objects of previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) were single token or entity, which were not suitable for commonsense knowledge in free-text form. To address the aforementioned challenges, we conducted experiments from two perspectives: knowledge localization and knowledge editing. Firstly, we introduced Knowledge Localization for Free-Text(KLFT) method, revealing the challenges associated with the distribution of commonsense knowledge in MLP and Attention layers, as well as in decentralized distribution. Next, we propose a Dynamics-aware Editing Method(DEM), which utilizes a Dynamics-aware Module to locate the parameter positions corresponding to commonsense knowledge, and uses Knowledge Editing Module to update knowledge. The DEM method fully explores the potential of the MLP and Attention layers, and successfully edits commonsense knowledge based on free-text. The experimental results indicate that the DEM can achieve excellent editing performance",

The study also reveals the model's performance sensitivity to data ratios, challenges the concept of optimal data ratios, and explores the impact of data volume changes on model accuracy. Furthermore, it deepens the understanding of how different task types affect model performance fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "With the popularity of the Internet, online social media has increasingly become a platform for people to share their attitudes towards life, such as optimism and pessimism about the future. While the Internet embraces various views, it also quietly deepens the formation of impressions on different views and attitudes. A large part of these texts will form the corpus of the pre-trained model, and the model may learn the tendency of life attitudes in the corpus. Our work develops new methods to (1) measure life attitude biases in LMs trained on such corpora and (2) measure the judgement impact of downstream models trained on different life attitude corpus. We focus on mental health disorder detection, aiming to empirically quantify the effects of life attitude (optimism, pessimism) leaning in pretraining data on the influence of risk-related tasks. Our findings reveal that pretrained LMs do have life attitude leanings that reinforce the polarization present in pretraining corpora, propagating life attitude biases into mental health disorder detection.We discussed strategies that might mitigate or leverage models of different life attitude leaning",

Despite this, these LLM agents introduce unexpected safety risks when operating in interactive environments. Instead of centering on the harmlessness of LLM-generated content in most prior studies, this work addresses the imperative need for benchmarking the behavioral safety of LLM agents within diverse environments. We introduce R-Judge, a benchmark crafted to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in judging and identifying safety risks given agent interaction records. R-Judge comprises 569 records of multi-turn agent interaction, encompassing 27 key risk scenarios among 5 application categories and 10 risk types. It is of high-quality curation with annotated safety labels and risk descriptions. Evaluation of 11 LLMs on R-Judge shows considerable room for enhancing the risk awareness of LLMs: The best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 74.42% while no other models significantly exceed the random. Moreover, we reveal that risk awareness in open agent scenarios is a multi-dimensional capability involving knowledge and reasoning, thus challenging for LLMs. With further experiments, we find that fine-tuning on safety judgment significantly improve model performance while straightforward prompting mechanisms fail.

    "abstract": "Clinical notes are essential for physicians to accurately assess patient conditions, particularly in oncology where records are extensive. Efficient and effective information extraction from these notes is crucial for effective treatment. This is not a trivial task due to the lengthy and specialized content in the notes. Current methods that capture token-level or sentence-level relations, which are context-dependent, are sometimes insufficient for knowledge-intensive tasks such as information extraction from EHR that require external knowledge. To address this, we introduce a knowledge-enhanced hierarchical multimodal cross-attention approach. This method employs a cross-attention mechanism to integrate textual knowledge with patient network knowledge, aiming to synthesize information across multiple data levels, including word, sentence, note, and patient levels. This approach can efficiently highlight key sentences in clinical notes. We validate our method using extensive experiments on a large real-world dataset.

However, the research question remains relatively under-explored: Should multiple defendants and charges be treated separately in Legal judgment prediction?

Despite the promising progress, their proficiency in compositional reasoning over attributes and relations (eg, distinguishing between \"the car is underneath the person\" and \"the person is underneath the car\") remains notably inadequate. We investigate the cause for this deficient behavior is the composition attribution issue, where the attribution scores (eg, attention scores or GradCAM scores) for relations (eg, underneath) or attributes (eg, red) in text are substantially lower than those for object terms. In this work, we show such issue is mitigated via a novel framework called CAE (Composition Attribution Enhancement). This generic framework incorporates various interpretable attribution methods to encourages the model to pay greater attention on composition words denoting relationships and attributes within the text. Detailed analysis shows that our approach enables the models to adjust and rectify the attribution on the texts. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks reveal that our framework significantly enhances the ability to discern intricate details and construct more sophisticated interpretations of combined visual and linguistic elements",

    "abstract": "Safety backdoor attacks in large language models (LLMs) enable harmful behaviors to be stealthily triggered while evading detection during normal interactions. The high dimensionality of the trigger search space and the diverse range of potential malicious behaviors in LLMs make this a critical open problem. This paper presents BEEAR, a novel mitigation method based on a key insight: backdoor triggers induce a uniform drift in the model's embedding space, irrespective of the trigger's form or targeted behavior. Leveraging this observation, we introduce a bi-level optimization approach. The inner level identifies universal perturbations to the decoder's embeddings that steer the model towards defender-defined unwanted behaviors; the outer level fine-tunes the model to reinforce safe behaviors against these perturbations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, reducing the success rate of safety backdoor attacks from over 95\\% to $<$1\\% for general harmful behaviors and from 47\\% to 0\\% for Sleeper Agents, without compromising the model's helpfulness. Notably, our method relies only on defender-defined sets of safe and unwanted behaviors without any assumptions about the trigger location or attack mechanism.

Its increased credibility and broader impact make detection more complex, requiring robust reasoning across diverse media types and profound knowledge for accurate verification.

Leveraging their proficiency in processing visual and textual information, LVLM demonstrates promising capabilities in recognizing complex information and exhibiting strong reasoning skills.

However, current text-to-SQL LLMs are computationally expensive and challenging to deploy in real-world applications, highlighting the importance of compressing them. To achieve this goal, knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach, which aims to distill the larger teacher model into a smaller student model. While numerous KD methods for autoregressive LLMs have emerged recently, it is still under-explored whether they work well in complex text-to-SQL scenarios. To this end, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that these KD methods generally fall short in balancing performance and efficiency. In response to this problem, we propose to improve the KD with imperfect data, namely KID, which effectively boosts the performance without introducing much training budget. The core of KID is to efficiently mitigate the training-inference mismatch by simulating the cascading effect of inference in the imperfect training data. Extensive experiments on 5 text-to-SQL benchmarks show that, KID can not only achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +5.83% average score) across all model types and sizes, but also effectively improve the training efficiency",

Indeed, existing work has shown that LLMs can be used to great effect for many tasks, such as information retrieval (IR), and passage ranking. However, current state-of-the-art results heavily lean on the capabilities of the LLM being used. Currently, proprietary, and very large LLMs such as GPT-4 are the highest performing passage re-rankers. Hence, users without the resources to leverage top of the line LLMs, or ones that are closed source, are at a disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pre-filtering step before passage re-ranking in IR. Our experiments show that by using a small number of human generated relevance scores, coupled with LLM relevance scoring, it is effectively possible to filter out irrelevant passages before re-ranking. Our experiments also show that this pre-filtering then allows the LLM to perform significantly better at the re-ranking task. Indeed, our results show that smaller models such as Mixtral can become competitive with much larger proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4)",

    "abstract": "Despite its popularity in sentence-level relation extraction, distantly supervised data is rarely utilized by existing work in document-level relation extraction due to its noisy nature and low information density. Among its current applications, distantly supervised data is mostly used as a whole for pertaining, which is of low time efficiency. To fill in the gap of efficient and robust utilization of distantly supervised training data, we propose Efficient Multi-Supervision for document-level relation extraction, in which we first select a subset of informative documents from the massive dataset by combining distant supervision with expert supervision, then train the model with Multi-Supervision Ranking Loss that integrates the knowledge from multiple sources of supervision to alleviate the effects of noise. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the model performance with higher time efficiency than existing baselines",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Emotions are expressed differently and in different context and domain. On Twitter, for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag \\#anger to express this affective state, while in a news headline, such an emotion needs to be written in a polite manner. To enable conditional text generation models to create appropriate texts, users need a parameter that allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To achieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization methodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives and outputs a set of prompts for different preference weightings of the objectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their context. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various domain-specific emotion classifiers. Our findings indicate that MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp across all objectives with only a minimal loss (1--2 pp) for any single objective compared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are offset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives -- which is not possible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces computational resources by simultaneously optimizing for multiple objectives, eliminating separate optimizations for each objective",

    "abstract": "In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs. In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5.

In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient dynamic prefix method and formalize INER as a unified seq2seq generation task. By employing the dynamic prefix as a task instructor to guide the generative model, our approach can preserve task-invariant knowledge while adapting to new entities with minimal parameter updates, making it particularly effective in low-resource scenarios.

Identifying text segments requiring fact-checking is known as claim detection (CD) and claim check-worthiness detection (CW), the latter incorporating complex domain-specific criteria of worthiness and often framed as a ranking task. Zero- and few-shot LLM prompting is an attractive option for both tasks, as it bypasses the need for labeled datasets and allows verbalized claim and worthiness criteria to be directly used for prompting. We evaluate the LLMs' predictive accuracy and accuracy on five CD/CW datasets from diverse domains, each utilizing a different worthiness criterion. We examine two key aspects: (1) how to best distill factuality and worthiness criteria into a prompt, and (2) how much context to provide for each claim. To this end, we experiment with different levels of prompt verbosity and varying amounts of contextual information given to the model. We additionally evaluate the top-performing models with ranking metrics, resembling prioritization done by fact-checkers. Our results show that optimal prompt verbosity varies, meta-data alone adds more performance boost than co-text, and confidence scores can be directly used to produce reliable check-worthiness rankings",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have played a fundamental role in various natural language processing tasks with powerful prompt techniques. However, in real-world applications, there are often similar prompt components for repeated queries, which causes significant computational burdens during inference. Existing prompt compression and direct fine-tuning methods aim to tackle these challenges, yet they frequently struggle to strike an optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance effectiveness, especially in complex tasks such as NL2Code. In this paper, we propose a novel method namely PromptIntern to internalize the prompt knowledge into model parameters via progressive fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of decoder-only autoregressive language models, explainability evaluation research has predominantly focused on encoder-only models, specifically masked language models (MLMs). Evaluating the faithfulness of an explanation methodâ€”how accurately the method explains the inner workings and decision-making of the modelâ€”is very challenging because it is very hard to separate the model from its explanation. Most faithfulness evaluation techniques corrupt or remove some input tokens considered important according to a particular attribution (feature importance) method and observe the change in the model's output. While these faithfulness evaluation techniques are suitable for MLMs, as they involve corrupted or masked inputs during pretraining, they create out-of-distribution inputs for CLMs due to the fundamental difference in their training objective of next token prediction. In this study, we propose a technique that leverages counterfactual generation to evaluate the faithfulness of attribution methods for autoregressive language modeling scenarios. Our technique creates natural, fluent, and in-distribution counterfactuals, something that we show is important for a faithfulness evaluation method. We apply our method to several attribution methods and evaluate their faithfulness in predicting the important tokens of a few large language models",

To steer LLMs towards human preference, alignment technologies have been introduced and gained increasing attention. Nevertheless, existing methods heavily rely on high-quality positive-negative training pairs, suffering from noisy positive responses that are barely distinguishable from negative ones. Given recent LLMs' proficiency in generating helpful responses, this work pivots towards a new research question: **can we achieve alignment using solely human-annotated negative samples, preserving helpfulness while reducing harmfulness?** For this purpose, we propose Distributional Dispreference Optimization (D$^2$O), which maximizes the discrepancy between dispreferred responses and the generated non-negative ones. In this way, D$^2$O effectively eschews harmful information without incorporating noisy positive samples, while avoiding collapse using self-generated responses as anchors. We demonstrate that D$^2$O can be regarded as learning a distributional preference model reflecting human dispreference against negative responses, which is theoretically an upper bound of the instance-level DPO. Extensive experiments manifest that our method achieves comparable generation quality and surpasses the latest strong baselines in producing less harmful and more informative responses with better training stability and faster convergence",

    "title": "Enhancing Zero-shot Emotion Perception in Conversation through the Internal-to-External Chain-of-Thought",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "An excellent emotional dialogue model needs to rapidly adapt to new scenarios and perform emotion analysis to meet rapidly changing demands. Therefore, enhancing the model's zero-shot emotion-related capabilities in the dialogue domain has become a new challenge. However, current research shows that large language models (LLMs) perform poorly in zero-shot emotion-related tasks and the Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) task alone doesn't comprehensively reflect the model's emotion understanding capabilities. In this paper, we propose an Emotion Perception in Conversation (EPC) task, which includes both ERC and Emotion Inference in Conversations (EIC), to evaluate the model's emotion perception capabilities in dialogue comprehensively. We propose an Internal-to-External Chain-of-Thought (IoECoT) method for the EPC task. This is a plug-and-play method that first extracts personality information of the dialogue participants from the dialogue history as internal factors influencing emotions, and then uses the sentiment polarity of the historical utterances as external factors. Finally, emotions are perceived by combining internal and external factors. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments, and the results show that IoECoT significantly outperforms other baselines across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that IoECoT effectively enhances the emotion perception capabilities of LLMs in zero-shot scenarios",

    "title": "Playing with News Context for Algorithmic Trading",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The application of reinforcement learning for algorithmic trading in the spot market using numerical data is a well-studied problem. However, news data consists of hard-to-quantify information which the investors use to base their trading decisions. Thus factoring in news data for algorithmic trading can improve the trading performance of the RL agent. This paper proposes an RL-based framework that performs algorithmic trading in the futures market by combining news data and price data. We propose two approaches for representing the context of the news data: sentiment-aware approach and context-aware approach. We investigate the effect of these approaches on the trading performance of the RL agent. We further compare the performance of on-policy and off-policy RL algorithms. The models are evaluated by trading in the NIFTY 50 index. The evaluation of the models show that using context-aware approach for representation of news data significantly improves the return (\\%) and also reduces the maximum drawdown of the trading model during a trading session",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various tasks, but their performance is highly sensitive to the prompts utilized. This variability poses challenges for accurate assessment and user satisfaction. Current research frequently overlooks instance-level prompt variations and their implications on subjective evaluations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \\textbf{ProSA}, a framework designed to evaluate and comprehend prompt sensitivity in LLMs. ProSA incorporates a novel sensitivity metric, \\texttt{PromptSensiScore}, and leverages decoding confidence to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Our extensive study, spanning multiple tasks, uncovers that prompt sensitivity fluctuates across datasets and models, with larger models exhibiting enhanced robustness. We observe that few-shot examples can alleviate this sensitivity issue, and subjective evaluations are also susceptible to prompt sensitivities, particularly in complex, reasoning-oriented tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that higher model confidence correlates with increased prompt robustness. We believe this work will serve as a helpful tool in studying prompt sensitivity of LLMs",

    "abstract": "A common method to solve complex problems in software engineering, is to divide the problem into multiple sub-problems. Inspired by this, we propose a Modular Architecture for Software-engineering AI (MASAI) agents, where different LLM-powered sub-agents are instantiated with well-defined objectives and strategies tuned to achieve those objectives. Our modular architecture offers several advantages: (1) employing and tuning different problem-solving strategies across sub-agents, (2) enabling sub-agents to gather information from different sources scattered throughout a repository, and (3) avoiding unnecessarily long trajectories which inflate costs and add extraneous context. MASAI enabled us to achieve the highest performance (28.33% resolution rate) on the popular and highly challenging SWE-bench Lite dataset consisting of 300 GitHub issues from 11 Python repositories. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of MASAI relative to other agentic methods and analyze the effects of our design decisions and their contribution to the success of MASAI",

However, this framework has an evident drawback as a domain-agnostic detector cannot ensure the identification of only those entity spans that are specific to the target domain. To address this issue, we propose Double-Checker, which leverages collaboration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and small models. Specifically, we employ LLMs to verify candidate spans predicted by the small model and eliminate any spans that fall outside the scope of the target domain.

Previous works have focused on generic AI-generated text detection or have presented an approach for estimating the fraction of peer-reviews that can be AI-generated. Our focus here is to solve a real-world problem by assisting the editor or chair in determining whether a review is written by ChatGPT or not. To address this, we introduce the Term Frequency (TF) model, which posits that AI often repeats tokens, and the Review Regeneration (RR) model which is based on the idea that ChatGPT generates similar outputs upon re-prompting. We stress test these detectors against token attack and paraphrasing. Finally we propose an effective defensive strategy to reduce the effect of paraphrasing on our models. Our findings suggest both our proposed methods perform better than other AI text detectors. Our RR model is more robust, although our TF model performs better than the RR model without any attacks.

This bias, stemming from using a question set with a low concept coverage rate to represent a subject, can potentially lead to skewed results. To address this, we present ConceptPsy, a Chinese conceptual benchmark specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' complex reasoning and knowledge in psychology. ConceptPsy encompasses 12 core subjects and 1,383 concepts from official exams. To avoid copyright issues, we prompt \\texttt{GPT-4} to generate questions for each of the concepts, which are then validated by psychology professionals to ensure high quality. Besides the overall scores, we annotate each question with a chapter label to provide fine-grained results. We evaluate a range of LLMs on ConceptPsy and the results show significant performance differences across psychology concepts, even among models from the same series.

Experiments on well-known LLMs (i.e., Llama2 series and OPT) show that AdaInfer can achieve an average of 17.8% pruning ratio, even up to 43% on sentiment tasks while maintaining comparable performance with minimal loss (<1%).

We tackle this problem by proposing \\texttt{ObfuscaTune}, a novel, efficient and fully utility-preserving approach that combines a simple yet effective obfuscation technique with an efficient usage of confidential computing (only $~5\\%$ of the model parameters are placed on TEE). We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of \\texttt{ObfuscaTune} by validating it on GPT-2 models with different sizes on four NLP benchmark datasets. Finally, we compare to a naive version of our approach to highlight the necessity of using random matrices with low condition numbers in our approach to reduce errors induced by the obfuscation",

However, the parsing accuracy drops sharply when the model is transferred to low-resource language due to distribution shifts. To alleviate this issue, we propose a representation alignment and adversarial model to filter out useful knowledge from rich-resource language and ignore useless ones. Our proposed model consists of two components, i.e., an alignment network in the input layer for selecting useful language-specific representation features and an adversarial network in the encoder layer for augmenting the language-invariant contextualized features. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that our proposed model outperforms RoBARTa-enhanced strong baseline models by 1.37 LAS and 1.34 UAS. Detailed analysis shows that both alignment and adversarial networks are equally important in alleviating the distribution shifts problem and can benefit from each other. In addition, the comparative experiments demonstrate that both the alignment and adversarial networks can substantially facilitate extracting and utilizing relevant target language features, thereby increasing the adaptation capability of our proposed model",

It can simultaneously supervise the internal preference model at the token level and optimize the mapping layer of the reward model at the sequence level. Theoretical justifications and experiment results on five datasets show the validity and effectiveness of our proposed hybrid framework for training a high-quality reward model.

    "abstract": "Large Language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable abilities in understanding complex texts, offering a promising path towards human-like translation performance. However, this study reveals the misalignment between the translation-specific understanding and the general understanding inside LLMs. This understanding misalignment leads to LLMs mistakenly or literally translating some complicated concepts that they accurately comprehend in the general scenarios (e.g., QA). To align the translation-specific understanding to the general one, we propose a novel translation process, DUAT (Difficult words Understanding Aligned Translation), explicitly incorporating the general understanding on the complicated content incurring inconsistent understandings to guide the translation. Specifically, DUAT performs cross-lingual interpretation for the difficult-to-translate words and enhances the translation with the generated interpretations. Furthermore, we reframe the external tools to improve DUAT in detecting difficult words and generating helpful interpretations. We conduct experiments on the self-constructed benchmark Challenge-WMT, consisting of samples that are prone to mistranslation. Human evaluation results on high-resource and low-resource language pairs indicate that DUAT significantly facilitates the understanding alignment, which improves the translation quality (up to +3.85 COMET) and reduces translation literalness by -25% âˆ¼ -51%",

Prior studies involve addressing the calculation errors and step-missing errors, but neglect the semantic misunderstanding errors, which is the major factor limiting the LLMs' performance. To this end, we propose a simple-yet-effective method, namely Deeply Understanding the Problems (DUP), to improve the LLMs' math problem-solving ability by addressing semantic misunderstanding errors. The core of our method is to encourage the LLMs to deeply understand the problems and extract the key problem-solving information used for better reasoning. Extensive experiments on 10 diverse reasoning benchmarks show that our DUP method consistently outperforms the other counterparts by a large margin.

In this paper, we answer the question: Do LLMs know multilingual facts and can they use this knowledge for effective fact-checking? To this end, we create a benchmark by filtering multilingual claims from the X-fact dataset and evaluating the multilingual fact-checking capabilities of five LLMs across five diverse languages: Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Tamil on our benchmark. We employ three different prompting techniques: Zero-Shot, English Chain-of-Thought, and Cross-Lingual Prompting, using both greedy and self-consistency decoding. We extensively analyze our results and find that GPT-4o achieves the highest accuracy, but zero-shot prompting with self-consistency was the most effective overall. We also show that techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Cross-Lingual Prompting, which are designed to improve reasoning abilities, do not necessarily improve the fact-checking abilities of LLMs. Interestingly, we find a strong negative correlation between model accuracy and the amount of internet content for a given language. This suggests that LLMs are better at fact-checking from knowledge in low-resource languages. We hope that this study will encourage more work on multilingual fact-checking using LLMs",

However, prior studies have shown that dense models could contain harmful parameters that affect the model performance. This prompted us to consider whether SimCSE might also have similar harmful parameters. To tackle the problem, parameter sparsification is applied, where alignment and uniformity scores are used to measure the contribution of each parameter to the overall quality of sentence embeddings. Drawing from a preliminary study, we hypothesize that parameters with minimal contributions are detrimental, and sparsifying them would result in an improved model performance. Accordingly, a sparsified SimCSE (SparseCSE) is proposed. To systematically explore the ubiquity of detrimental parameters and the removal of them, extensive experiments are conducted on the standard semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and transfer learning tasks. The results show that the proposed SparseCSE significantly outperform SimCSE. Furthermore, through an in-depth analysis, we establish the validity and stability of our sparsification method, showcasing that the embedding space generated by SparseCSE exhibits an improved alignment compared to that produced by SimCSE.

However, they fail to fully separate the task ability from the source language or the language ability from the chosen task. In this paper, we acknowledge the mutual reliance between task ability and language ability and direct our attention toward the gap between the target language and the source language on tasks. As the gap removes the impact of tasks, we assume that it remains consistent across tasks. Based on this assumption, we propose a new cross-lingual transfer method called $\\texttt{AdaMergeX}$ that utilizes adaptive adapter merging. By introducing a reference task, we can determine that the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the reference task in both languages follows the same distribution as the divergence of adapters fine-tuned on the target task in both languages. Hence, we can obtain target adapters by combining the other three adapters. Furthermore, we propose a structure-adaptive adapter merging method.

This study addresses the limitations of manual data annotation by leveraging synthetic data generation (SDG) techniques using large language models (LLMs). We evaluate four SDG methodsâ€”plain prompting, sampling, precise attributes, and adjective attributesâ€”to generate synthetic job ads and assess their impact on classification model performance. Our analysis focuses on the balance between dataset size, data diversity and label-fit, and we explore the use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) filtering to enhance data quality. Results show that models trained on synthetic data can effectively classify real-world job ads, achieving competitive performance. However, we observed significant volatility in outcomes, which we could not fully explain. By making our code and data publicly available, we provide the research community with opportunities to further investigate SDG techniques. By publishing our best models, we offer researchers tools capable of achieving up to 96% F1 on a real-world dataset for classifying German OJAs by employment type",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models have recently revolutionized the NLP field, while they still fall short in some specific down-stream tasks. In the work, we focus on utilizing LLMs to perform machine translation, where we observe that two patterns of errors frequently occur and drastically affect the translation quality: language mismatch and repetition. The work sets out to explore the potential for mitigating these two issues by leveraging model editing methods, e.g., by locating FFN neurons or something that are responsible for the errors and deactivating them in the inference time. We find that directly applying such methods either limited effect on the targeted errors or has significant negative side-effect on the general translation quality, indicating that the located components may also be crucial for ensuring machine translation with LLMs on the rails. To this end, we propose to refine the located components by fetching the intersection of the locating results under different language settings, filtering out the aforementioned information that is irrelevant to targeted errors. The experiment results empirically demonstrate that our methods can effectively reduce the language mismatch and repetition ratios and meanwhile enhance or keep the general translation quality in most cases",

While these models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various applications, they are prone to generating content infused with hallucinations, compromising the trustworthiness of their output. This phenomenon raises concerns of LLM applications, particularly when the dissemination of misleading information can have detrimental impacts. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method called \\textsc{HalluAttack} which generates high quality counterfactual instruction data in order to reduce the hallucinations. We observe that these counterfactual instruction data can unlock the self-reflection ability of LLMs, and the LLMs will use knowledge learnt from pretraining phase more accurately. We conducted experiments across multiple open-source LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach\\footnote{The data we used for fine-tuning is publicly available in \\url{https://github.com/oldstree/halluattack}}. Results consistently demonstrate that, through counterfactual attack and subsequent fine-tuning, we are able to significantly improve the model performance on hallucination benchmarks (e.g. TruthfulQA and HalluQA). Moreover, we also find that the LLMs fine-tuned with counterfactual instruction data can also achieve gains on public general benchmarks like C-Eval, MMLU and GSM8K, which also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on hallucination mitigation",

To address this, we introduce the LM-KG Fidelity metric to assess KG representation reliability and propose the LM-KG Distribution-aware Alignment (LKDA) algorithm to improve explanation faithfulness.

    "abstract": "Parameter Efficient Tuning (PET) techniques such as Low-rank Adaptation~(LoRA) are effective methods to adapt Large Language Models to downstream tasks. We propose Sparse mixture of low Rank Adaption~(SiRA), which uses Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) by enforcing conditional computation with top k LoRA weights. SiRA is optimized through a combination of training techniques, including an auxiliary loss encouraging load balancing, a capacity limit which restricts the maximum number of tokens each expert can process, and novel expert dropout on top of the gating network. Through extensive experiments, we show that SiRA performs better than LoRA and other mixture of expert approaches across different single-task and multiple-task settings. Results show SiRA has more orthogonal low rank spaces and consumes less computing resources compared to other MoE variants",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation supports language models to strengthen their factual groundings by providing external context. However, language models often face challenges in locating and integrating extensive information, diminishing their effectiveness in solving complex questions. Query-focused compression tackles this issue by filtering out information irrelevant to the query, but current methods still struggle in realistic scenarios where crucial information may not be located with a single-step approach. To overcome this limitation, we introduce COMPACT, a novel framework that employs an active strategy to condense extensive documents without losing key information. COMPACT flexibly operates as a cost-efficient plug-in module with any off-the-shelf retriever or reader model, achieving extremely high compression rates (44x). Our experiments demonstrate that COMPACT brings significant improvements in both compression rate and QA performance on multi-hop question-answering datasets",

    "abstract": "Trading range breakout is a key method in the technical analysis of financial trading, widely employed by traders in financial markets such as stocks, futures, and foreign exchange. However, distinguishing between true and false breakout and providing the correct rationale cause significant challenges to investors. Traditional quantitative methods require large amounts of data and cannot directly present the reasoning process to users, making them less than perfect in this field. Recently, large language models have achieved success in various downstream applications, but their effectiveness in the domain of financial breakout detection has been subpar. The reason is that the unique data and specific knowledge are required in breakout detection. To address these issues, we created the first financial breakout dataset and introduce FinanceGPT-B, the premier large language model for financial breakout detection. Furthermore, we have developed a novel framework for large language models, namely multi-stage structure, effectively reducing mistakes in downstream applications. Experimental results indicate that compared to GPT-3.5, FinanceGPT-B improves the average accuracy of answers and rational by 49.97\\%, with the multi-stage structure contributing 9.72\\% to the improvement.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Due to the continuous emergence of new data, version updates have become an indispensable requirement for Large Language Models (LLMs). The training paradigms for version updates of LLMs include pre-training from scratch (PTFS) and continual pre-training (CPT). Preliminary experiments demonstrate that PTFS exhibits better pre-training performance, while the training cost of CPT is lower. Moreover, their performance and training cost gaps gradually widen with the version updates processing. To investigate the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, we analyze the effect of learning rate adjustments during the two stages of CPT: preparing an initialization checkpoint and conducting pre-training based on this checkpoint. We find that a large learning rate in the first stage and a complete learning rate decaying process in the second stage are crucial for version updates of LLMs. Hence, we propose a learning rate path switching training paradigm. Our paradigm comprises one main path, where we pre-train a LLM with the maximal learning rate, and multiple branching paths, each of which corresponds to an update of the LLM with newly-added training data. Compared with PTFS, when training four versions of LLMs, our paradigm can reduce the total training cost to 58% while maintaining comparable pre-training performance. In addition, we also validate the generalization of our paradigm, further proving its practicability",

However, these methods still fall short in verifiability and require certain time costs for fact checking. This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim (Refer & Claim), which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step.

In this paper, we focus on entity type ambiguity and analyze current state-of-the-art LLMs for their proficiency and consistency in applying their factual knowledge when prompted for entities under ambiguity. To do so, we propose an evaluation protocol that disentangles knowing from applying knowledge and test state-of-the-art LLMs on 49 entities. Our experiments reveal that LLMs perform poorly with ambiguous prompts, achieving only 80% accuracy. Our results further demonstrate systematic discrepancies in LLM behavior and their failure to consistently apply information, indicating that the models can exhibit knowledge without being able to utilize it, significant biases for preferred readings, as well as self-inconsistencies.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Despite advances in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, English remains the dominant language for LLM research and development. This has led to the widespread practice of pre-translation, i.e., translating the task prompt into English before inference. Selective pre-translation, a more surgical approach, focuses on translating specific prompt components. However, its current use lacks a systematic research foundation. Consequently, the optimal pre-translation strategy for various multilingual settings and tasks remains unclear. In this work, we aim to uncover the optimal setup for pre-translation by systematically assessing its modes of use. Specifically, we view the prompt as a modular entity, composed of four functional parts: instruction, context, examples (zero-shot / few-shot), and output, either of which could be translated or not. We evaluate pre-translation strategies across 35 languages covering both low and high-resource languages, and assessing various capabilities including Question Answering (QA), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Abstractive Summarization. Our experiments uncover the impact of factors as translation quality, similarity to English, and the size of pre-trained data, on the model performance with pre-translation. Finally, we suggest practical guidelines for choosing the optimal strategy in various multilingual scenarios",

    "abstract": "Large language models demonstrate reasonable multilingual abilities, despite predominantly English-centric pretraining. However, the spontaneous multilingual alignment in these models is shown to be weak, leading to unsatisfactory cross-lingual transfer and knowledge sharing. Previous works attempt to address this issue by explicitly injecting multilingual alignment information during or after pretraining. Thus for the early stage in pretraining, the alignment is weak for sharing information or knowledge across languages. In this paper, we propose PreAlign, a framework that establishes multilingual alignment prior to language model pretraining. PreAlign injects multilingual alignment by initializing the model to generate similar representations of aligned words and preserves this alignment using a code-switching strategy during pretraining. Extensive experiments in a synthetic English to English-Clone setting demonstrate that \\method significantly outperforms standard multilingual joint training in language modeling, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer, and cross-lingual knowledge application.

This gap is caused by a lack of explicit task-language distribution characterization exposed to the model. Addressing this by capturing these distributions explicitly through task guidelines enhances model performance. We then present LongGuide, the first efficient algorithm that generates two types of guidelines as additional instructions for LLMs: (i) Metric Guideline (MG) that instructs models to optimize for selected metrics; and (ii) Output Constraint Guideline (OCG) that constrains generation at both the token and sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the most useful combination of guidelines, improving strong open- and closed-source LLMs by 5.39% and 6.58% under zero- and few-shot settings across seven tasks.

Concretely, given an input question, we first prompt the LLM to generate knowledge triplets, forming a graph representation of the question. Unlike conventional knowledge triplets, our approach allows variables as head or tail entities, effectively representing a question as knowledge triplets. Second, for each triplet, the LLM generates a corresponding sub-question and answer along with using knowledge retrieval. If the prediction confidence exceeds a threshold, the sub-question and prediction are incorporated into the prompt for subsequent processing. This approach encourages that sub-questions are grounded in the extracted knowledge triplets, reducing redundancy and irrelevance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous CoT prompting methods and their variants on multi-hop question-answering benchmark datasets",

Traditional evaluations fail to assess a model's factual correctness. To rectify this absence, we present MoleculeQA, a novel question answering (QA) dataset which possesses 62K QA pairs over 23K molecules. Each QA pair, composed of a manual question, a positive option and three negative options, has consistent semantics with a molecular description from authoritative corpus. MoleculeQA is not only the first benchmark to evaluate molecular factual correctness but also the largest molecular QA dataset. A comprehensive evaluation on MoleculeQA for existing molecular LLMs exposes their deficiencies in specific aspects and pinpoints crucial factors for molecular modeling.

    "abstract": "Recent methods have demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve reasoning tasks better when they are encouraged to solve subtasks of the main task first. In this paper we devise a similar strategy that breaks down reasoning tasks into a problem decomposition phase and a problem solving phase and show that the strategy is able to outperform a single stage solution. Further, we hypothesize that the decomposition should be easier to distill into a smaller model compared to the problem solving because the latter requires large amounts of domain knowledge while the former only requires learning general problem solving strategies. We propose methods to distill these two capabilities and evaluate their impact on reasoning outcomes and inference cost. We find that we can distill the problem decomposition phase and at the same time achieve good generalization across tasks, datasets, and models. However, it is harder to distill the problem solving capability without losing performance and the resulting distilled model struggles with generalization. These results indicate that by using smaller, distilled problem decomposition models in combination with problem solving LLMs we can achieve reasoning with cost-efficient inference and local adaptation",

    "abstract": "Adapting pre-trained language models (PLMs) for cross-task generalization is a crucial research area within the field of NLP. While fine-tuning and in-context learning are effective approaches for adapting LMs to emerging tasks, they can be costly and inefficient. Recently, some researchers have focused on achieving efficient task adaptation via hypernetwork, which is a meta network that generates task-specific weights based on task-oriented information without any optimization. However, the training of hypernetworks often lacks stability since the optimization signal is not straightforward, and the task information is not adequately representative. Moreover, previous works train hypenetworks with the general corpus, which is struggling with few-shot adaptation. To address these issues, we introduce HyperLoRA, a hypernetwork for LoRA parameters generation involving hypernetwork pre-training on instruction-following data and generalization fine-tuning on sparse task data. Furthermore, we utilize a constrained training loss and a gradient-based demonstration selection strategy to enhance the training stability and performance. Experimental results and analysis across four benchmark datasets (P3, S-NI, BBH, and SuperGLUE) demonstrate the proposed approach has flexible generalization ability and superior performance",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "LLMs have become a go-to solution not just for text generation, but also for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Acquiring extensive knowledge through language modeling on web-scale corpora, they excel on English NLU, yet struggle to extend their NLU capabilities to underrepresented languages. In contrast, machine translation models (MT) produce excellent multilingual representations, resulting in strong translation performance even for low-resource languages. MT encoders, however, lack the knowledge necessary for comprehensive NLU that LLMs obtain through language modeling training on immense corpora. In this work, we get the best both worlds by integrating MT encoders directly into LLM backbones via sample-efficient self-distillation. The resulting MT-LLMs preserve the inherent multilingual representational alignment from the MT encoder, allowing lower-resource languages to tap into the rich knowledge embedded in English-centric LLMs. Merging the MT encoder and LLM in a single model, we mitigate the propagation of translation errors and inference overhead of MT decoding inherent to discrete translation-based cross-lingual transfer (e.g., translate-test). Evaluation spanning three prominent NLU tasks and 127 predominantly low-resource languages renders MT-LLMs highly effective in cross-lingual transfer. MT-LLMs substantially and consistently outperform translation-test based on the same MT model, showing that we truly unlock multilingual language understanding for LLMs",

    "abstract": "During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First, we curate a dataset \\textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test, to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we propose a novel criterion, \\textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \\textbf{MPE}, a simple but effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.\\footnote{Our code will be made publicly available",

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA.

In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R^3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples.

These scenarios often require LLMs to be adapted to meet specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective adaptation method DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation based on Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLM as learning opportunities and overcomes its own shortcomings through error revision, thereby achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED includes identifying the erroneous code generated by LLM, using Self-revise for code revision, optimizing the model with the revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that DEED achieves superior performance compared with mainstream fine-tuning and prompting methods using only a small amount of training data, with an average relative improvement of 54.7% on Pass@1 on multiple code generation datasets. We also verify the effectiveness of Self-revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets.

Previous work has shown that LLMs display biases in emotion attribution along gender lines.

Religions, therefore, cultivate certain emotions. Moreover, these rules are explicitly laid out and interpreted by religious leaders. Using emotion attribution, we explore how different religions are represented in LLMs. We find that: Major religions in the US and European countries are represented with more nuance, displaying a more shaded model of their beliefs. Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism are strongly stereotyped. Judaism and Islam are stigmatized -- the models' refusal skyrocket. We ascribe these to cultural bias in LLMs and the scarcity of NLP literature on religion. In the rare instances where religion is discussed, it is often in the context of toxic language, perpetuating the perception of these religions as inherently toxic.

Building upon this observation, we propose a novel and interpretable prompt-tuning method named IntCoOp, which learns to jointly align attribute-level inductive biases and class embeddings during prompt-tuning. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate IntCoOp across two representative tasks in a few-shot learning setup: generalization to novel classes, and unseen domain shifts. Through extensive experiments across 10 downstream datasets on CLIP, we find that introducing attribute-level inductive biases leads to superior performance against state-of-art prompt tuning frameworks. Notably, in a 16-shot setup, IntCoOp improves CoOp by 7.35% in average performance across 10 diverse datasets",

    "title": "Tool Graph Retriever: Exploring Dependency Graph-based Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the remarkable advancement of AI agents, the number of their equipped tools is increasing rapidly. However, integrating all tool information into the limited model context becomes impractical, highlighting the need for efficient tool retrieval methods. In this regard, dominant methods primarily rely on semantic similarities between tool descriptions and user queries to retrieve relevant tools. However, they often consider each tool independently, overlooking dependencies between tools, which may lead to the omission of prerequisite tools for successful task execution. To deal with this defect, in this paper, we propose Tool Graph Retriever (TGR), which exploits the dependencies among tools to learn better tool representations for retrieval. First, we construct a dataset termed TDI300K to train a discriminator for identifying tool dependencies. Then, we represent all candidate tools as a tool dependency graph and use graph convolution to integrate the dependencies into their representations. Finally, these updated tool representations are employed for online retrieval. Experimental results on several commonly used datasets show that our TGR can bring a performance improvement to existing dominant methods, achieving SOTA performance. Moreover, in-depth analyses also verify the importance of tool dependencies and the effectiveness of our TGR",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in many natural language processing tasks. However, our experiment reveals that, in stance detection tasks, LLMs may generate biased stances due to sentiment-stance spurious correlations and preference towards certain individuals and topics, thus harming their performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to Mitigate Biases of LLMs in stance detection with Calibration (MB-Cal). To be specific, a novel calibration network is devised to calibrate potential bias in the stance prediction of LLMs. Further, to address the challenge of effectively learning bias representations and the difficulty in the generalizability of debiasing, we construct counterfactual augmented data. This approach enhances the calibration network, facilitating the debiasing and out-of-domain generalization. Experimental results on in-target and zero-shot stance detection tasks show that the proposed MB-Cal can effectively mitigate biases of LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results",

    "abstract": "This paper tackles the task of emotion-cause pair extraction in the unsupervised domain adaptation setting. The problem is challenging as the distributions of the events causing emotions in target domains are dramatically different than those in source domains, despite the distributions of emotional expressions between domains are overlapped. Inspired by causal discovery, we propose a novel deep latent model in the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework, which not only captures the underlying latent structures of data but also utilizes the easily transferable knowledge of emotions as the bridge to link the distributions of events in different domains. To facilitate knowledge transfer across domains, we also propose a novel variational posterior regularization technique to disentangle the latent representations of emotions from those of events in order to mitigate the damage caused by the spurious correlations related to the events in source domains. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the strongest baseline by approximately 11.05\\% on a Chinese benchmark and 2.45\\% on a English benchmark in terms of weighted-average F1 score.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess powerful capabilities and play a crucial role in daily life. Instruction fine-tuning is essential for training LLMs, enabling them to understand human instructions and produce the desired output. Selecting appropriate data for instruction fine-tuning is essential but challenging, existing data selection methods struggle to balance effectiveness and efficiency in real-world scenarios. Given that instruction fine-tuning requires models to respond to a wide variety of questions, we focus on output quality to assess the quality of instruction fine-tuning samples. In this work, we propose a novel data selection framework that evaluates data from unknown sources based on its output. To guide the model in distinguishing instruction fine-tuning data, we train a discriminator that uses outputs from models of varying quality as supervision signals. We establish principles to evaluate model quality, asserting that a model's quality is higher if it is a newer version, has more parameters, and achieves higher scores on well-known benchmarks. This way, the discriminator learns the differences between outputs from different models, enabling it to categorize unknown data into the most similar model outputs.

With the increase in available context length of LLMs, recent experiments have shown that the performance of ICL does not necessarily scale well in many-shot (demonstration) settings. We hypothesize that the reason lies in more demonstrations dispersing the model attention from the query, hindering its understanding of key content, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Inspired by how humans learn from examples, we propose a training-free method FocusICL, which conducts triviality filtering to avoid attention being diverted by unimportant contents at token-level and operates hierarchical attention to further ensure sufficient attention towards current query at demonstration-level. We also design an efficient hyperparameter searching strategy for FocusICL based on model perplexity of demonstrations. Comprehensive experiments validate that FocusICL achieves an average performance improvement of 5.2% over vanilla ICL and scales well with many-shot demonstrations",

While knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent method for this, research on KD for generative language models like LLMs is relatively sparse, and the approach of distilling student-friendly knowledge, which has shown promising performance in KD for classification models, remains unexplored in generative language models. To explore this approach, we propose PromptKD, a simple yet effective method that utilizes prompt tuning - for the first time in KD - to enable generative language models to transfer student-friendly knowledge. Unlike previous works in classification that require fine-tuning the entire teacher model for extracting student-friendly knowledge, PromptKD achieves similar effects by adding a small number of prompt tokens and tuning only the prompt with student guidance. Extensive experiments on instruction-following datasets show that PromptKD achieves state-of-the-art performance while adding only 0.0007% of the teacher's parameters as prompts. Further analysis suggests that distilling student-friendly knowledge alleviates exposure bias effectively throughout the entire training process, leading to performance enhancements",

    "abstract": "Solving grid puzzles involves a significant amount of logical reasoning. Hence, it is a good domain to evaluate reasoning capability of a model which can then guide us to improve the reasoning ability of models. However, most existing works evaluate only the final predicted answer of a puzzle, without delving into an in-depth analysis of the LLMs' reasoning chains (such as where they falter) or providing any finer metrics to evaluate them. Since LLMs may rely on simple heuristics or artifacts to predict the final answer, it is crucial to evaluate the generated reasoning chain beyond overall correctness measures, for accurately evaluating the reasoning abilities of LLMs. To this end, we first develop GridPuzzle, an evaluation dataset comprising of 274 grid-based puzzles with different complexities. Second, we propose a new error taxonomy derived from manual analysis of reasoning chains from LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini, Mistral, and Llama-2. Then, we develop a LLM-based framework for large-scale subjective evaluation (i.e., identifying errors) and an objective metric, PuzzleEval, to evaluate the correctness of reasoning chains. Evaluating reasoning chains from LLMs leads to several interesting findings. We further show that existing prompting methods used for enhancing models' reasoning abilities do not improve performance on GridPuzzle.

Our results show that PBNs, as a mere architectural variation of vanilla LMs, offer more robustness compared to vanilla LMs under both targeted and static settings.

    "abstract": "While current tasks of converting natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) using Foundation Models have shown impressive achievements, adapting these approaches for converting natural language to Graph Query Language (NL2GQL) encounters hurdles due to the distinct nature of GQL compared to SQL, alongside the diverse forms of GQL. Moving away from traditional rule-based and slot-filling methodologies, we introduce a novel approach, $R^3$-NL2GQL, integrating both small and large Foundation Models for ranking, rewriting, and refining tasks. This method leverages the interpretative strengths of smaller models for initial ranking and rewriting stages, while capitalizing on the superior generalization and query generation prowess of larger models for the final transformation of natural language queries into GQL formats. Addressing the scarcity of datasets in this emerging field, we have developed a bilingual dataset, sourced from graph database manuals and selected open-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our evaluation of this methodology on this dataset demonstrates its promising efficacy and robustness",

    "abstract": "The fine-tuning of open-source large language models (LLMs) for machine translation has recently received considerable attention, marking a shift towards data-centric research from traditional neural machine translation. However, the area of data collection for instruction fine-tuning in machine translation remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we present LexMatcher, a simple yet effective method for data curation, the design of which is driven by the coverage of senses found in bilingual dictionaries. The construction process comprises data retrieval from an existing corpus and data augmentation that supplements the infrequent senses of polysemous words. Utilizing LLaMA2 as our base model, our approach outperforms the established baselines on the WMT2022 test sets and also exhibits remarkable performance in tasks related to word sense disambiguation and specialized terminology translation.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing tasks but struggle with hallucination issues. Existing solutions have considered utilizing LLMs' inherent reasoning abilities to alleviate hallucination, such as self-correction and diverse sampling methods. However, these methods often overtrust LLMs' initial answers due to inherent biases. The key to alleviating this issue lies in overriding LLMs' inherent biases for answer inspection. To this end, we propose a CounterFactual Multi-Agent Debate (CFMAD) framework. CFMAD presets the stances of LLMs to override their inherent biases by compelling LLMs to generate justifications for a predetermined answer's correctness. The LLMs with different predetermined stances are engaged with a skeptical critic for counterfactual debate on the rationality of generated justifications. Finally, the debate process is evaluated by a third-party judge to determine the final answer. Extensive experiments on four datasets of three tasks demonstrate the superiority of CFMAD over existing methods",

To address this gap, we investigate zero-shot domain adaptation for claim verification, where no labeled training data is available for the target domain. We propose a hybrid approach that combines utilizing labeled training data from a source domain via in-context learning, along with topically relevant contexts from target document collections such as Wikipedia by means of RAG.

Bridging the human cognition mechanism into LMMs, we aim for the models to engage with and generate responses that span a wider contextual scene understanding, mitigating hallucinatory outputs.

    "abstract": "Despite demonstrating emergent reasoning abilities, Large Language Models (LLMS) often lose track of complex, multi-step reasoning. Existing studies show that providing guidance via decomposing the original question into multiple subproblems elicits more robustness in LLM reasoning -- a decomposer generates the subproblems, and a solver solves each of these subproblems. However, these techniques fail to accommodate coordination between the decomposer and the solver modules (either in a single model or different specialized ones) -- the decomposer does not keep track of the ability of the solver to follow the decomposed reasoning. In this paper, we propose LM2 to address these challenges. LM2 modularizes the decomposition, solution, and verification into three different language models. The decomposer module identifies the key concepts necessary to solve the problem and generates step-by-step subquestions according to the reasoning requirement. The solver model generates the solution to the subproblems that are then checked by the verifier module; depending upon the feedback from the verifier, the reasoning context is constructed using the subproblems and the solutions. These models are trained to coordinate using policy learning. Exhaustive experimentation suggests the superiority of LM2 over existing methods on in- and out-domain reasoning problems, outperforming the best baselines by 8.1% on MATH, 7.71% on JEEBench, and 9.7% on MedQA problems",

In this paper, we explore the inner mechanisms of safety alignment from the perspective of mechanistic interpretability, focusing on identifying and analyzing *safety neurons* within LLMs that are responsible for safety behaviors. We propose generation-time activation contrasting to locate these neurons and dynamic activation patching to evaluate their causal effects. Experiments on multiple recent LLMs show that: (1) Safety neurons are sparse and effective. We can restore $90$\\% safety performance with intervention only on about $5$\\% of all the neurons. (2) Safety neurons encode transferrable mechanisms. They exhibit consistent effectiveness on different red-teaming datasets. The finding of safety neurons also interprets ''alignment tax''. We observe that the identified key neurons for safety and helpfulness significantly overlap, but they require different activation patterns of the shared neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of safety neurons in detecting unsafe outputs before generation. Our findings may promote further research on understanding LLM alignment.

We propose a prompt method Finite State Machine (FSM) to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM for complex tasks in addition to improved effectiveness and trustworthiness. Different from chain-of-thought (COT) methods, FSM addresses MHQA by iteratively decomposing a question into multi-turn sub-questions, and self-correcting in time, improving the accuracy of answers in each step. Specifically, FSM addresses one sub-question at a time and decides on the next step based on its current result and state, in an automaton-like format.

    "abstract": "Though Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in mathematics reasoning, they are still struggling with performing numeric operations accurately, such as addition and multiplication. Numbers can be tokenized into tokens in various ways by different LLMs and affect the numeric operations performance. Currently, there are two representatives: 1) Tokenize into $1$-digit, and 2) Tokenize into $1\\sim 3$ digit. The difference is roughly equivalent to using different numeral systems (namely base $10$ or base $10^{3}$). In light of this, we study the scaling behavior of different numeral systems in the context of transformer-based large language models. We empirically show that a base $10$ system is consistently more data-efficient than a base $10^{2}$ or $10^{3}$ system across training data scale, model sizes under from-scratch training settings, while different number systems have very similar performances when fine-tuned. Through thorough analysis and experiments, we conclude that tokenizing numbers into $1$-digit is more favorable for LLMs in numerical operations.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This paper studies in-context learning (ICL) by decomposing the output of large language models into the individual contributions of attention heads and MLPs (components). We observe curious components: good-performing ones that individually do well on a classification task, even when the model performs poorly; bad-performing ones that do much worse than chance; and label-biased components that always predict the same label. We find that component accuracies are well-correlated across different demonstration sets and perturbations of prompt templates, even when the full-model accuracy varies greatly. Based on our findings, we propose component reweighting, which learns to linearly re-scale the component activations from a few labeled examples. Given 24 labeled examples, our method improves by an average of 6.0% accuracy points over 24-shot ICL across 8 tasks on Llama-2-7B. Overall, this paper both enriches our understanding of ICL and provides a practical method for improvement by examining model internals",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in aligning large language models with human intentions, yet it often relies on complex methodologies like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and present challenges in sample efficiency and stability. In this paper, we introduce Inverse-Q*, an innovative framework that transcends traditional RL methods by optimizing token-level reinforcement learning without the need for additional reward or value models. Inverse-Q* leverages direct preference optimization techniques but extends them by estimating the conditionally optimal policy directly from the model's responses, facilitating more granular and flexible policy shaping. Our approach reduces reliance on human annotation and external supervision, making it especially suitable for low-resource settings. We present extensive experimental results demonstrating that Inverse-Q* not only matches but potentially exceeds the effectiveness of PPO in terms of convergence speed and the alignment of model responses with human preferences. Our findings suggest that Inverse-Q* offers a practical and robust alternative to conventional RLHF approaches, paving the way for more efficient and adaptable model training approaches",

In contrast to LoRA and other low-rank adaptation methods such as AdaLoRA, Delta-LoRA not only updates the low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$, but also propagate the learning to the pre-trained weights $W$ via updates utilizing the delta of the product of two low-rank matrices ($A^{(t+1)}B^{(t+1)} - A^{(t)}B^{(t)}$). Such a strategy effectively addresses the limitation that the incremental update of low-rank matrices is inadequate for learning representations capable for downstream tasks. Moreover, as the update of $W$ does not need to compute the gradients of $W$ and store their momentums, Delta-LoRA shares comparable memory requirements and computational costs with LoRA. Extensive experiments show that Delta-LoRA significantly outperforms existing low-rank adaptation methods.

    "abstract": "As the expansion of application of Large Language Models (LLMs), concerns about the safety of LLMs have grown among researchers. Numerous previous studies demonstrated the potential risks of LLMs to generate harmful contents and proposed various safety assessment benchmarks aimed at evaluating the safety risks. However, the evaluation questions in current benchmarks are not only too straightforward to be easily rejected by target LLMs, but also difficult to update questions with practical significance due to their lack of correlation with real-world events, thereby making these benchmarks challenging to sustainably apply in continuous evaluaton tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SafetyQuizzer, a question generation framework for evaluating the safety of LLMs in a more sustained manner. SafetyQuizzer leverages fine-tuned LLM and jailbreaking attack templates to generate weakly offensive questions and so reduces the decline rate. Additionally, by employing retrieval-augmented generation, SafetyQuizzer incorporates the latest events into evaluation questions, overcoming the challenge of question updates and introducing a new dimension of event relevance to enhance the quality of evaluation questions. Our experiments show that evaluation questions generated by SafetyQuizzer significantly reduce the decline rate compared to other benchmarks while still maintaining comparable attack success rate.

    "abstract": "Opinion summarization in e-commerce encapsulates the collective views of numerous users about a product based on their reviews. Typically, a product on an e-commerce platform has thousands of reviews, each review comprising around 10-15 words. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in summarization tasks, they struggle to handle such a large volume of reviews due to context limitations. To address this, we propose a scalable framework called XL-OPSUMM, that generates summaries incrementally with the help of an Aspect Dictionary (Refer to Section 3). However, the existing test set, AMASUM, has only 560 reviews per product on average. Due to the lack of a test set with thousands of reviews, we created a new test set called XL-FLIPKART by gathering data from the Flipkart website and generating summaries using GPT-4. Through various automatic evaluations and extensive analysis, we evaluated the framework's efficiency on two datasets, AMASUM and Xl-Flipkart. Experimental results show that our framework, XL-OPSUMM, powered by Llama-3-8B-8k, achieves an average ROUGE-1 F1 gain of 4.38% and a ROUGE-L F1 gain of 3.70% over the next best-performing model",

Then, execution feedback-based rejection sampling can generate data for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training.

On the other hand, translation-specific LLMs are built by pre-training on domain-specific monolingual corpora and fine-tuning with human-annotated translation data. Despite the superior performance, these methods either demand an unprecedented scale of computing and data or substantial human editing and annotation efforts. In this paper, we develop Ladder, a novel model-agnostic and cost-effective tool to refine the performance of general LLMs for MT. Ladder is trained on pseudo-refinement triplets which can be easily obtained from existing LLMs without additional human cost. During training, we propose a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy with an easy-to-hard schema, improving Ladder's refining performance progressively. The trained Ladder can be seamlessly integrated with any general-purpose LLMs to boost their translation performance. By utilizing Gemma-2B/7B as the backbone, Ladder-2B can elevate raw translations to the level of top-tier open-source models (e.g., refining BigTranslate-13B with +6.91 BLEU and +3.52 COMET for XXâ†’En), and Ladder-7B can further enhance model performance to be on par with the state-of-the-art GPT-4.

    "abstract": "RL-based techniques can be employed to search for prompts that, when fed into a target language model, maximize a set of user-specified reward functions. However, in many target applications, the natural reward functions are in tension with one another -- for example, content preservation vs. style matching in style transfer tasks. Current techniques focus on maximizing the average of reward functions, which does not necessarily lead to prompts that achieve balance across rewards -- an issue that has been well-studied in the multi-objective and robust optimization literature. In this paper, we conduct an empirical comparison of several existing multi-objective optimization techniques adapted to this new setting: RL-based discrete prompt optimization. We compare two methods optimizing the volume of the Pareto reward surface and one method that chooses an update direction that benefits all rewards simultaneously. We evaluate performance on two NLP tasks: style transfer and machine translation, each using three competing reward functions. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-objective methods that directly optimize the volume of the Pareto reward surface perform better and achieve a better balance of all rewards than those that attempt to find monotonic update directions",

    "abstract": "Using prompt-based \"diversity interventions\" is a typical way to improve diversity for Text-to-Image models to depict individuals with various racial or gender traits.

In this work, we propose **DemOgraphic FActualIty Representation (DoFaiR)**, a benchmark to quantify the trade-off between using diversity interventions and preserving demographic factuality in Text-to-Image models. DoFaiR consists of 756 test instances, various diversity prompts, and evaluation metrics to reveal the factuality tax of diversity instructions through an automated, fact-checked, and evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments with DALLE-3 on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions improve the number of different gender and racial groups in generated images at the cost of accurate historical demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose **Fact-Augmented Intervention** (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI remarkably preserves demographic factuality under diversity interventions, while also boosting diversity",

Notably, $\\mathbb{IA}$ is an inference-only method, thus could enhance the safety of LLMs without compromising their helpfulness. Extensive experiments on varying jailbreak benchmarks across ChatGLM, Llama2, Llama3, Vicuna, MPT, DeepSeek, and GPT-3.5 show that $\\mathbb{IA}$ could consistently and significantly reduce the harmfulness in responses (averagely -48.2\\% attack success rate) without compromising the general helpfulness.

In this paper, we introduce a benchmark to evaluate gender-related social biases based on the step-by-step process using CoT prompts. We construct the benchmark for an English reasoning task where the LLM is given a list of words comprising feminine, masculine, and gendered occupational words, and is required to count the number of feminine and masculine words. Our CoT prompts require the LLM to explicitly indicate whether each word in the word list is feminine or masculine. Experimental results show that considering both the step-by-step process and predictions of LLMs improves the quality of bias evaluation. Furthermore, despite the simplicity of the task of counting words, our benchmark produces evaluations of gender-related social biases that are comparable to existing human-scratched benchmarks",

This presents a challenge in understanding the information they capture, and how it is encoded within transformer networks, raising the possibility that encoded biases may remain undetected. This work addresses confounding bias learned during model fine-tuning, when a pretrained language model is adapted to downstream domains and tasks. Building on previous methodologies, we extend them by proposing the Extended Confounding Filter and the Dual Filter. These methods aim to isolate and address weights within the transformer network that are associated with confounding variables through distinct training phases. We evaluate these methods on the \\textit{DementiaBank} dataset, a first-person narrative dataset that contains language of patients with cognitive impairment and healthy controls. We aim to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods in the domain of dementia detection as a means to correct for gender-related disparities in class distribution at training time. Our results show that transformer models can overfit to the subpopulation distribution in the training data. By disrupting the weights associated with known confounders, we show that fairer models can be achieved with reduced prediction bias towards specific subgroups. Moreover, our findings highlight resilience of the model against weights deletion and show a trade-off between model performance in dementia detection and the reduction of disparities across gender groups",

ASC follows recent work, Universal Self-Consistency (USC) in using multiple stochastic samples from an LLM to improve the long-form response. Unlike USC which only focuses on selecting the best single generation, ASC picks authentic subparts from the samples and merges them into a superior composite answer. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we show that merging relevant subparts of multiple samples performs significantly better than picking a single sample. ASC demonstrates significant gains over USC on multiple factoids and open-ended QA datasets - ASQA, QAMPARI, QUEST, ELI5 with ChatGPT and Llama3. Our analysis also reveals untapped potential for enhancing long-form generations using approach of merging multiple samples",

Existing methods, wrappers-based methods suffer from limited adaptability and scalability when faced with a new website, while language agents, empowered by large language models (LLMs), exhibit poor reusability in diverse web environments. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of generating web scrapers with LLMs and propose AutoScraper, a two-stage framework that can handle diverse and changing web environments more efficiently. AutoScraper leverages the hierarchical structure of HTML and similarity across different web pages for generating web scrapers. Besides, we propose a new executability metric for better measuring the performance of web scraper generation tasks. We conduct comprehensive experiments with multiple LLMs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our work is now open-source",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models~(LLMs) has opened up unprecedented possibilities for automating complex tasks that are often comparable to human performance. Despite their capabilities, LLMs still encounter difficulties in completing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and complexity due to their inherent limitations in handling multifaceted problems single-handedly. This paper introduces `Smurfs', a cutting-edge multi-agent framework designed to revolutionize the application of LLMs. By seamlessly transforming a conventional LLM into a synergistic multi-agent ensemble, Smurfs can enhance the model's ability to solve complex tasks at no additional cost. This is achieved through innovative prompting strategies that allocate distinct roles within the model, thereby facilitating collaboration among specialized agents and forming an intelligent multi-agent system. Our empirical investigation on both open-ended task of StableToolBench and closed-ended task on HotpotQA showcases Smurfs' superior capability in intricate tool utilization scenarios. Notably, Smurfs outmatches all the baseline methods in both experiments, setting new state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, through comprehensive ablation studies, we dissect the contribution of the core components of the multi-agent framework to its overall efficacy. This not only verifies the effectiveness of the framework, but also sets a route for future exploration of multi-agent LLM systems",

We also include LLaMA as a baseline architecture for softmax attention for comparison. These models were trained with six variants, ranging from 70M to 7B parameters on a 300B-token corpus, and evaluated with a total of 1,376 intermediate checkpoints on various downstream tasks. These tasks include validation loss, commonsense reasoning, and information retrieval and generation.

    "title": "Take Off the Training Wheels! Progressive In-Context Learning for Effective Alignment",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have explored the working mechanisms of In-Context Learning (ICL). However, they mainly focus on classification and simple generation tasks, limiting their broader application to more complex generation tasks in practice. To address this gap, we investigate the impact of demonstrations on token representations within the practical alignment tasks. We find that the transformer embeds the task function learned from demonstrations into the separator token representation, which plays an important role in the generation of prior response tokens. Once the prior response tokens are determined, the demonstrations become redundant. Motivated by this finding, we propose an efficient Progressive In-Context Alignment (PICA) method consisting of two stages. In the first few-shot stage, the model generates several prior response tokens via standard ICL while concurrently extracting the ICL vector that stores the task function from the separator token representation. In the following zero-shot stage, this ICL vector guides the model to generate responses without further demonstrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PICA not only surpasses vanilla ICL but also achieves comparable performance to other alignment tuning methods. The proposed training-free method reduces the time cost (e.g., 5.45Ã—) with improved alignment performance (e.g., 6.57+). Consequently, our work highlights the application of ICL for alignment and calls for a deeper understanding of ICL for complex generations",

Extensive studies across different research focuses, different personality psychometrics, and different LLMs make it challenging to have a holistic overview and further pose difficulties in applying findings to real-world applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review by categorizing current studies into three research problems: self-assessment, exhibition, and recognition, based on the intrinsic characteristics and external manifestations of personality in LLMs. For each problem, we provide a thorough analysis and conduct in-depth comparisons of their corresponding solutions. Besides, we summarize research findings and open challenges from current studies and further discuss their underlying causes. We also collect extensive publicly available resources to facilitate interested researchers and developers. Lastly, we discuss the potential future research directions and application scenarios.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, leading to an expectation for LLMs to be trustworthy ---- both accurate and well-calibrated (the prediction confidence should align with its ground truth correctness likelihood). Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to \"tuning-induced mis-calibration\". In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher's knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the \"concentrated knowledge\" phenomenon during distillation, which can significantly reduce the computational burden. Then we apply a \"trustworthy maximization\" process to optimize the utilization of this small portion of concentrated knowledge before transferring it to the student. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where better accuracy (+2.3\\%) and less mis-calibration (-10\\%) are achieved on average across both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating better trustworthiness",

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been a widely-used and effective method for fine-tuning LLMs. However, LoRA alone exhibits limited benefits when confronted with multi-task or multi-domain scenarios. Given the prevalent existence of multi-domain challenges in machine translation, this paper focuses on enhancing the Multi-Domain Translation Capabilities of LLMs. We extend LoRA to Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, defined as MoE-LoRA, to address domain conflicts in multi-domain settings. Our approach involves introducing MoE-LoRA solely at higher layers to target specific domain-related knowledge acquisition, preceded by General Cross-Lingual Alignment during the training process. Particularly, we propose a methodology called Expert Margin Optimization to facilitate the transfer of additional knowledge from other domains to enhance the inputs specific to a domain.

Activation sparsification can mitigate these challenges by reducing the number of activated neurons during inference.

Existing susceptibility studies heavily rely on self-reported beliefs, which can be subject to bias, expensive to collect, and challenging to scale for downstream applications. To address these limitations, in this work, we propose a computational approach to efficiently model users' latent susceptibility levels. As shown in previous work, susceptibility is influenced by various factors (e.g., demographic factors, political ideology), and directly influences people's reposting behavior on social media. To represent the underlying mental process, our susceptibility modeling incorporates these factors as inputs, guided by the supervision of people's sharing behavior. Using COVID-19 as a testbed, our experiments demonstrate a significant alignment between the susceptibility scores estimated by our computational modeling and human judgments, confirming the effectiveness of this latent modeling approach. Furthermore, we apply our model to annotate susceptibility scores on a large-scale dataset and analyze the relationships between susceptibility with various factors. Our analysis reveals that political leanings, etc., psychological factors exhibit varying degrees of association with susceptibility to COVID-19 misinformation, and shows that susceptibility is unevenly distributed across different professional and geographical backgrounds",

This process involves abstracting specific instances into higher-level concepts and forming abstract knowledge that can be applied in unfamiliar or novel situations, which can enhance models' inferential capabilities and support the effective transfer of knowledge across various domains. Despite its significance, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview that comprehensively examines existing works in the definition, execution, and application of conceptualization to enhance reasoning tasks. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting the first comprehensive survey of 150+ papers, categorizing various definitions, resources, methods, and downstream applications related to conceptualization into a unified taxonomy, with a focus on the entity and event levels.

We compare the performance of 4 state of the art LLMs on the benchmark, analyzing their performance in dependence of the length of the event sequence considered as well as of the explicitness of the temporal reference.

Recent language models still have much room for improvement in their data efficiency compared to humans. In this paper, we investigate whether language models efficiently use indirect data (indirect evidence), from which they infer sentence acceptability. In contrast, humans use indirect evidence efficiently, which is considered one of the inductive biases contributing to efficient language acquisition. To explore this question, we inject synthetic instances with newly coined \"wug\" words into pretraining data and explore the model's behavior on evaluation data that assess grammatical acceptability regarding those words. We prepare the injected instances by varying their levels of indirectness and quantity. Our experiments surprisingly show that language models do not acquire grammatical knowledge even after repeated exposure to instances with the same structure but differing only in lexical items from evaluation instances in certain language phenomena. Our findings suggest a potential direction for future research: developing models that use latent indirect evidence to acquire grammatical knowledge",

    "title": "Model Tells Itself Where to Attend: Faithfulness Meets Automatic Attention Steering",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various real-world tasks. However, recent studies reveal that LLMs often struggle to fully comprehend and effectively utilize their input contexts, resulting in responses that lack faithfulness or suffer from hallucination. This difficulty becomes particularly evident when the contexts are lengthy or contain distracting information, which can divert LLMs from fully capturing essential evidence. Most prior work focuses on designing effective prompts to guide LLMs in utilizing contextual information more faithfully. For instance, iterative prompting highlights key information through two high-level prompting steps that first ask the LLM to identify important pieces of context and then derive answers accordingly. However, prompting methods are constrained to highlighting key information implicitly in token space, which is often insufficient to fully steer the model's attention. To improve model faithfulness more reliably, we propose AutoPASTA, a method that automatically identifies contextual key information and explicitly highlights it by steering the model's attention scores. Similar to prompting, AutoPASTA is applied at inference time and does not require changing any model parameters. Our experiments on open-book QA demonstrate that AutoPASTA can effectively guide models to grasp essential contextual information, leading to substantially improved model faithfulness and performance, e.g., an average improvement of 11.26% for LLAMA3-8B-Instruct.

To fill this gap, we dissect DPR into two key attributes, i.e., the psychologist's empathy and proactive guidance. We thus present WundtGPT, an empathetic and proactive mental health large language model that is acquired by fine-tuning it with instruction and real conversation between psychologists and patients. It is designed to assist psychologists in diagnosis and help patients who are reluctant to communicate face-to-face understand their psychological conditions. Its uniqueness lies in that it could not only pose purposeful questions to guide patients in detailing their symptoms but also offer warm emotional reassurance. In particular, WundtGPT incorporates \\textbf{Collection of Questions}, \\textbf{Chain of Psychodiagnosis}, and \\textbf{Empathy Constraints} into a comprehensive prompt for eliciting LLMs' questions and diagnoses. Additionally, WundtGPT proposes a reward model to promote alignment with empathetic mental health professionals, which encompasses two key factors: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) pre-trained by next token prediction are inherently proficient in generative tasks. However, their performance on knowledge-driven tasks such as factual knowledge querying remains unsatisfactory. Knowledge graphs (KGs), as high-quality structured knowledge bases, can provide reliable knowledge for LLMs, potentially compensating for their knowledge deficiencies. Aligning LLMs with explicit, structured knowledge from KGs has been a challenge; previous attempts either failed to effectively align knowledge representations or compromised the generative capabilities of LLMs, leading to less-than-optimal outcomes. This paper proposes \\textbf{KaLM}, a \\textit{Knowledge-aligned Language Modeling} approach, which fine-tunes autoregressive LLMs to align with KG knowledge via the joint objective of explicit knowledge alignment and implicit knowledge alignment. The explicit knowledge alignment objective aims to directly optimize the knowledge representation of LLMs through dual-view knowledge graph contrastive learning. The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on incorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion language modeling.

Furthermore, comprehensive analysis under the framework inspired the development of Confidence-guided Fact-level self-correction (ConFact), which uses high-confidence facts within a response as additional knowledge to improve low-confidence ones.

In this work, we address the limitations of prior discrete diffusion models for conditional long-text generation, particularly in long sequence-to-sequence tasks such as abstractive summarization. Despite fast decoding speeds compared to autoregressive methods, previous diffusion models failed on the abstractive summarization task due to the incompatibility between the backbone architectures and the random noising process. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel semantic-aware noising process that enables Transformer backbones to handle long sequences effectively. Additionally, we propose CrossMamba, an adaptation of the Mamba model to the encoder-decoder paradigm, which integrates seamlessly with the random absorbing noising process. Our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark summarization datasets: Gigaword, CNN/DailyMail, and Arxiv, outperforming existing discrete diffusion models on ROUGE metrics as well as possessing much faster speed in inference compared to autoregressive models",

    "abstract": "Tokenization is a critical step in every NLP system, yet most works treat it as an isolated component separate from the models they are building. In this paper, we present a framework to jointly learn next-token prediction and segmentation from a sequence of characters or bytes. We evaluate our model on language modeling benchmarks in English, Chinese, and Japanese using both character and byte vocabularies. Our model consistently outperforms baselines on Chinese benchmarks with character vocabulary and shows significant improvements with byte vocabulary. Further latency improvements are achieved by adapting different pooling strategies while maintaining comparable results to the best models. Our main contributions are threefold: we propose a language model that learns to segment the input sequence, conforming to the desired segmentation prior; we demonstrate that our model achieves shorter latency than baselines in token generation; and we show that our model can be applied to three different languagesâ€”English, Chinese, and Japaneseâ€”demonstrating its potential for wider NLP applications.

Meanwhile, building high-quality benchmarks with much longer text lengths and more demanding tasks to provide comprehensive evaluations is of immense practical interest to facilitate long context understanding research of LLMs. However, prior benchmarks create datasets that ostensibly cater to long-text comprehension by expanding the input of traditional tasks, which falls short to exhibit the unique characteristics of long-text understanding, including long dependency tasks and longer text length compatible with modern LLMs' context window size. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark for extremely long context understanding with long-range dependencies, XL$^2$Bench, which includes three scenariosâ€”Fiction Reading, Paper Reading, and Law Readingâ€”and four tasks of increasing complexity: Memory Retrieval, Detailed Understanding, Overall Understanding, and Open-ended Generation, covering 27 subtasks in English and Chinese. It has an average length of 100K+ words (English) and 200K+ characters (Chinese). Evaluating seven leading LLMs on XL$^2$Bench, we find that their performance significantly lags behind human levels.

Traditional methods often segment sequence into chunks and compress them iteratively with fixed-size memory. However, our empirical analysis shows that the fixed-size memory results in wasted computational and GPU memory resources. Therefore, we introduces Incremental Memory (IM), a method that starts with a small memory size and gradually increases it, optimizing computational efficiency. Additionally, we propose Decremental Chunk based on Incremental Memory (IMDC), which reduces chunk size while increasing memory size, ensuring stable and lower GPU memory usage. Our experiments demonstrate that IMDC is consistently faster (1.45x) and reduces GPU memory consumption by 23.3\\% compared to fixed-size memory, achieving comparable performance on the LongBench Benchmark",

Prior approaches have failed to impart the human-desirable properties within an opinion summary. Recently, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become a dominant strategy in aligning Language Models (LMs) with human values. This motivates us to leverage RLHF for our task. The key to the strategy is learning a reward model ($\\varphi$), which can reflect the latent reward model of humans. The training process for $\\varphi$ requires sizeable human preference data, usually in the order of tens of thousands. However, human goals are subjective, and vary from task-to-task, hindering us from using a general purpose off-the-shelf reward model. This necessitates a large-scale preference annotation for our task, which is expensive and time-consuming.

    "abstract": "Recently, very large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on several English NLP tasks with just in-context learning (ICL), but their utility in other languages is still underexplored. We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of *zero-labelled* cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available -- however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language. We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting. SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy). To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages. In Stage I, using source MRL training data, target language's test data is noisily labeled. In Stage II, these noisy test data points are used as exemplars in ICL for further improved labelling. Additionally, our implementation of SSP uses a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, prediction confidence (when available) and label coverage. Experiments on three tasks and eleven LRLs (from three regions) demonstrate that SSP strongly outperforms existing SOTA fine-tuned and prompting-based baselines in 0-CLT setup",

This finding is generalizable across models and languages and is more evident in larger models.

    "abstract": "Commonsense Knowledge Bases (CSKB) Population, which aims at automatically expanding knowledge in CSKBs with external resources, is an important yet hard task in NLP. Fang et al. (2021a) proposed a CSKB Population (CKBP) framework with an evaluation set CKBP v1. However, CKBP v1 relies on crowdsourced annotations that suffer from a considerable number of mislabeled answers, and the evaluation set lacks alignment with the external knowledge source due to random sampling. In this paper, we introduce CKBP v2, a new high-quality CSKB Population evaluation set that addresses the two aforementioned issues by employing domain experts as annotators and incorporating diversified adversarial samples to make the evaluation data more representative. We show that CKBP v2 serves as a challenging and representative evaluation dataset for the CSKB Population task, while its development set aids in selecting a population model that leads to improved knowledge acquisition for downstream commonsense reasoning. A better population model can also help acquire more informative commonsense knowledge as additional supervision signals for both generative commonsense inference and zero-shot commonsense question answering. Specifically, the question-answering model based on DeBERTa-v3-large (He et al., 2023b) even outperforms powerful large language models in a zero-shot setting, including ChatGPT and GPT-3.5",

However, the collection and curation of high-quality training data requires significant costs and time investment, especially for collecting user-related information. In this paper we explore the usefulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating synthetic documents tailored to user's personal interests using user-related information. We introduce a new dataset, Sy-SE-PQA, to study the effectiveness of models fine-tuned on LLM-generated data and study how the complexity of personalization impacts model performances. We build Sy-SE-PQA based on an existing dataset, SE-PQA, which consists of questions and answers posted on the popular StackExchange communities. Starting from questions in SE-PQA, we generate synthetic answers using different prompt techniques and LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs have high potential in generating training data, tailored to user's needs, for neural retrieval models and it can be used to replace training data.

However, in Chinese, existing GEC datasets often fail to consider the importance of specific grammatical error types within compositional scenarios, lack research on data collected from native Chinese speakers, and largely overlook cross-sentence grammatical errors. Furthermore, the measurement of the overall fluency of an essay is often overlooked. To address these issues, we present CEFA (Chinese Essay Fluency Assessment), an extensive corpus that is derived from essays authored by native Chinese-speaking primary and secondary students and encapsulates essay fluency scores along with both coarse and fine-grained grammatical error types and corrections. Experiments employing various benchmark models on CEFA substantiate the challenging nature of our dataset. Our findings further highlight the significance of fine-grained annotations in fluency assessment and the mutually beneficial relationship between error types and corrections.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit various emergent abilities. Among these abilities, some might reveal the internal working mechanisms of models. In this paper, we uncover a novel emergent capability in models: the intrinsic ability to perform extended sequences of calculations without relying on chain-of-thought step-by-step solutions. Remarkably, the most advanced models are capable of directly outputting the results of two-digit number additions with lengths extending up to 15 addends. We hypothesize that the model emerges discrete representations of symbols within its hidden states and performs symbolic calculations internally. To test this hypothesis, we design a sequence of experiments that look into the hidden states. Specifically, we first confirm that Implicit Discrete State Representations (IDSRs) exist. Then, we provide interesting observations about the formation of IDSRs from layer, digit, and sequence perspectives. Finally, we confirm that models indeed use IDSRs to produce the final answers. However, we also discover that the state representations are far from lossless in current open-sourced models, leading to inaccuracies in final performance.

Recognizing and managing such scenarios is crucial for LLMs to ensure their reliability, but this exploration remains understudied. This study examines whether LLMs can identify incomplete conditions and appropriately determine when to refrain from using tools. To this end, we address a dataset by manipulating instances from two datasets by removing necessary tools or essential information for tool invocation. We confirm that most LLMs are challenged to identify the additional information required to utilize specific tools and the absence of appropriate tools.

    "abstract": "Pretrained language models memorize vast amounts of information, including private and copyrighted data, raising significant safety concerns. Retraining these models after excluding sensitive data is prohibitively expensive, making machine unlearning a viable, cost-effective alternative. Previous research has focused on machine unlearning for monolingual models, but we find that unlearning in one language does not necessarily transfer to others. This vulnerability makes models susceptible to low-resource language attacks, where sensitive information remains accessible in less dominant languages. This paper presents a pioneering approach to machine unlearning for multilingual language models, selectively erasing information across different languages while maintaining overall performance. Specifically, our method employs an adaptive unlearning scheme that assigns language-dependent weights to address different language performances of multilingual language models. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to existing unlearning baselines, setting a new standard for secure and adaptable multilingual language models",

    "abstract": "Interactive storytelling between parents and children is a common activity in the real world, in which parents expect to teach children both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story narratives. While increasing AI-assisted storytelling systems have been developed and used in children's story-based interaction and learning scenarios, existing systems often fall short of generating real-world knowledge infused conversation to meet parents' practical expectation of interactive storytelling, with the foremost reason of existing question-answering (QA) datasets these systems build on focusing mainly on the knowledge answerable within the story content. To bridge this gap, we designed an annotation framework empowered by real-world knowledge graph to facilitate experts' annotations while collecting their mental procedures. Further, we leveraged this annotation framework to build StorySpark, a dataset of 5,868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge beyond story context. A comprehensive benchmarking experiment, including both automated and human expert evaluation within various QA pair generation (QAG) settings, demonstrates the usability of our StorySpark on the story-based knowledgeable QAG task.

However, their low interpretability often leads to errors in unforeseen circumstances, limiting their utility. Many works have focused on creating comprehensive evaluation systems, but previous benchmarks have primarily assessed problem-solving abilities while neglecting the response's uncertainty, which may result in unreliability. Recent methods for measuring LLM reliability are resource-intensive and unable to test black-box models. To address this, we propose UBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLM reliability. UBENCH includes 3,978 multiple-choice questions covering knowledge, language, understanding, and reasoning abilities. Experimental results show that UBENCH has achieved state-of-the-art performance, while its single-sampling method significantly saves computational resources compared to baseline methods that require multiple samplings. Additionally, based on UBENCH, we evaluate the reliability of 15 popular LLMs, finding GLM4 to be the most outstanding, closely followed by GPT-4.

Weight quantization is an effective technique for reducing the decoding latency and memory requirements of LLMs. Existing approaches primarily aim to maintain the quality of quantized models by preserving outliers in input features, but they still suffer significant quality loss at lower bit widths. Our approach builds on Optimal Brain Quantization (OBQ), an iterative weight-update-based quantization framework. We identify a key limitation of OBQ, specifically that its uniform quantization grid is suboptimal for maintaining model quality, as it introduces large errors to the task loss.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance on tasks involving long contexts remains sub-optimal. In-Context Learning (ICL) with few-shot examples may be an appealing solution to enhance LLM performance in this scenario too. However, na\\\"ively adding ICL examples with long context faces challenges, including domain shifts between demonstrations and the target query and substantial token overhead added for each example. In this work, we propose to automatically generate few-shot examples for long context QA tasks by recycling contexts. Specifically, given a long input context (1-3k tokens) and a query, we generate additional query-output pairs from the given context as few-shot examples. This ensures that the demonstrations come from the same domain as the target query and only add a small number of tokens to the prompt. Furthermore, we enhance each demonstration example by instructing the model to \\textit{explicitly} identify the relevant paragraphs before the answer. This approach acts as a structured Chain of Thought and provides fine-grained attribution to the answer. We apply our method on multiple models and obtain a substantial improvement on various QA datasets with long context, especially when the answer lies within the middle of the text. Surprisingly, despite introducing only single-passage ICL examples, LLMs successfully generalize to multi-hop long-context QA using our approach",

Specifically, LLMs should refuse to answer unsafe tool use relevant instructions and insecure tool responses to ensure their reliability and harmlessness.

To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Graph Memory-based Editing for Large Language Models (GMeLLo), a straitforward and effective method that merges the explicit knowledge representation of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the linguistic flexibility of LLMs. Beyond merely leveraging LLMs for question answering, GMeLLo employs these models to convert free-form language into structured queries and fact triples, facilitating seamless interaction with KGs for rapid updates and precise multi-hop reasoning. Our results show that GMeLLo significantly surpasses current state-of-the-art knowledge editing methods in the multi-hop question answering benchmark, MQuAKE, especially in scenarios with extensive knowledge edits",

Poetry is a lightning rod for the marketing and popular imagination of LLM capabilities because it is a signifier of human creativity and complexity, as well as a popular and culturally significant art form. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? What can they know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize one aspect of English-language poetry, poetic form, which captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. We use this task to reflect on LLMs' current poetic capabilities, as well as the challenges and pitfalls of creating NLP benchmarks for poetry and for other creative tasks. In particular, we use this task to audit and reflect on the poems included in popular pretraining datasets. Our findings have implications for NLP researchers interested in model evaluation, digital humanities and cultural analytics research, and cultural heritage collections",

    "title": "Enhancing Controllable Generation with Improved Control Module Representations",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Controllable generation (CG) has been widely used in large language models (LLMs) for a wide range of language tasks, such as multi-task learning and human preference alignment. For example, prompt-based CG uses curated prompts as inputs (such as system prompts) to control LLMs behaviors. Finetuning-based CG is widely adopted when training data is available; it trains control modules and controls LLM behaviors by plugging these modules into LLMs (e.g., trainable prompts or LoRA weights). Finetuning-based CG can freeze LLMs and only train control modules for efficiency or train LLMs together with control models for effectiveness. We argue that fine-tuning control modules together with LLMs directly is not the optimal optimization strategy since their representations are often initialized irrelevantly to LLMs' representations, which adds more difficulty for optimization. A better optimization should first align control modules with the LLM's representation space and then optimize them together. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Two-step Freezing-then-Tuning framework (TFT) to achieve better optimization results for finetuning-based CG. Concretely, we first freeze LLMs and only optimize control modules to align their representations with LLMs, and then optimize control modules together with LLMs to ensure performance. Experiment results on two popular human preference alignment datasets and one multi-task learning dataset show that our approach significantly improves the controllable generation qualities compared with one-step optimization widely used in related works, and achieves better or on-par performance compared with other kinds of baselines, such as direct preference optimization",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL parsing involves the translation of natural language queries (NLQs) into their corresponding SQL commands. A principal challenge within this domain is the formulation of SQL queries that are not only syntactically correct but also semantically aligned with the natural language input. However, the intrinsic disparity between the NLQ and the SQL poses a significant challenge. In this research, we introduce Keyword Instruction (KeyInst), a novel method designed to enhance SQL formulation by Large Language Models (LLMs). KeyInst essentially provides guidance on pivotal SQL keywords likely to be part of the final query, thus facilitates a smoother SQL query formulation process. We explore two strategies for integrating KeyInst into Text-to-SQL parsing: a pipeline strategy and a single-pass strategy. The former first generates KeyInst for question, which are then used to prompt LLMs. The latter employs a fine-tuned model to concurrently generate KeyInst and SQL in one step. We developed StrucQL, a benchmark specifically designed for the evaluation of SQL formulation. Extensive experiments on StrucQL and other benchmarks demonstrate that KeyInst significantly improves upon the existing Text-to-SQL prompting techniques",

Despite its critical role in model performance, ensuring the quality of this data is challenging due to its sheer volume and the absence of sample-level quality annotations and enhancements. In this paper, we introduce DecorateLM, a data engineering method designed to refine the pretraining corpus through data rating, tagging and editing. Specifically, DecorateLM rates texts against quality criteria, tags texts with hierarchical labels, and edits texts into a more formalized format. Due to the massive size of the pretraining corpus, adopting an LLM for decorating the entire corpus is less efficient. Therefore, to balance performance with efficiency, we curate a meticulously annotated training corpus for DecorateLM using a large language model and distill data engineering expertise into a compact 1.2 billion parameter small language model (SLM). We then apply DecorateLM to enhance 100B billion tokens of the training corpus, selecting 45 billion tokens that exemplify high quality and diversity for the further training of another 1.2 billion parameter LLM. Our results demonstrate that employing such high-quality data can significantly boost model performance, showcasing a powerful approach to enhance the quality of the pretraining corpus",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been a surge in deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision-making tasks, such as income prediction and crime risk assessments. Due to bias in the pre-training data, LLMs generally present unfairness and discrimination against underprivileged groups. However, traditional fairness enhancement methods are generally impractical for LLMs due to the computational cost of fine-tuning and the black-box nature of powerful LLMs. To deal with this, In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a promising strategy for enhancing LLM fairness through input-output pairs, without the need for extensive retraining. Nevertheless, the efficacy of ICL is hindered by the inherent bias in both data and the LLM itself, leading to the potential exaggeration of existing societal disparities. In this study, we investigate the unfairness problem in LLMs and propose a novel demonstration selection strategy to address data and model biases when applying ICL.

However, this approach restricts LLMs to local performance improvements, neglecting global algorithmic innovation. Therefore, we adopt a completely different perspective by reconstructing the optimization pairs into a problem-oriented approach. This allows for the integration of various ingenious ideas from different programmers tackling the same problem. Experimental results demonstrate that adapting LLMs to problem-oriented optimization pairs significantly enhances their optimization capabilities. Meanwhile, we identified performance bottlenecks within the problem-oriented perspective.

Surprisingly, these safety patterns function as \"keys'' (used as a metaphor for security defense capability) that can be used to open or lock Pandora's Box of LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs against jailbreaking can be lessened or augmented by attenuating or strengthening the identified safety patterns.

To facilitate chart-based reasoning using natural language, various downstream tasks have been introduced recently such as chart question answering, chart summarization, and fact-checking with charts. These tasks pose a unique challenge, demanding both vision-language reasoning and a nuanced understanding of chart data tables, visual encodings, and natural language instructions. Despite the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse NLP tasks, their abilities and limitations in the realm of data visualization remain under-explored, possibly due to their lack of multi-modal capabilities. To bridge the gap, this paper presents one of the first comprehensive evaluations of the recently developed large vision language models (LVLMs) for chart understanding and reasoning tasks. Our evaluation includes a comprehensive assessment of both closed and open-sourced LVLMs across five major chart reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we perform a qualitative evaluation of LVLMs' performance on a diverse range of charts, aiming to provide a thorough analysis.

Such a system would reduce the burden on clinicians, who must otherwise rely on transcribing video recordings and checking them manually for signs of interference. We release a new, expert-annotated dataset for this task, and evaluate multiple state-of-the-art large language models.

In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints, we find that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the supervised fine-tuned model resembles high sensitivity to few-shot evaluation prompts, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The security of multi-turn conversational large language models (LLMs) is understudied despite it being one of the most popular LLM utilization. Specifically, LLMs are vulnerable to data poisoning backdoor attacks, where an adversary manipulates the training data to cause the model to output malicious responses to predefined triggers. Specific to the multi-turn dialogue setting, LLMs are at the risk of even more harmful and stealthy backdoor attacks where the backdoor triggers may span across multiple utterances, giving lee-way to context-driven attacks. In this paper, we explore a novel distributed backdoor trigger attack that serves to be an extra tool in an adversary's toolbox that can interface with other single-turn attack strategies in a plug and play manner. Results on two representative defense mechanisms indicate that distributed backdoor triggers are robust against existing defense strategies which are designed for single-turn user-model interactions, motivating us to propose a new defense strategy for the multi-turn dialogue setting that is more challenging. To this end, we also explore a novel contrastive decoding based defense that is able to mitigate the backdoor with a low computational tradeoff",

    "title": "EPT: Explosive Prompt Tuning For Parameter-Efficient with Large Norm Prompt",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Prompt tuning introduces additional learnable tokens, known as $\\textit{soft prompts}$, to frozen pre-trained language models for parameter-efficient tuning. Unlike fine-tuning, only these soft prompts are trained on downstream tasks rather than all model parameters. While recent prompt tuning approaches that introduce a reparameterization network have shown comparable performance to fine-tuning, they still require a large number of parameters for the soft prompts. In this paper, we empirically show the characteristics of the recent prompt tuning methods, such as the large norm of trained soft prompts and their significant similarity to each other. Inspired by these observations, we propose simple yet effective modifications to the reparameterization network for efficient prompt tuning, which involves inducing large norm, replacing overparameterization with under-parameterization, and focusing on a single prompt. This approach preserves the advantageous characteristics of the soft prompts while significantly reducing the number of parameters. Our comprehensive experiments across 21 diverse NLP datasets show that our method called EPT: Explosive Prompt Tuning, significantly outperforms prompt Tuning and achieves comparable performance full fine-tuning or other parameter-efficient tuning, with only 2.3K parameters during training on T5-base",

Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on the final activation state, InternalInspector conducts a comprehensive analysis across all internal states of every layer to accurately identify both correct and incorrect prediction processes. By benchmarking InternalInspector against existing confidence estimation methods across various natural language understanding and generation tasks, including factual question answering, commonsense reasoning, and reading comprehension, InternalInspector achieves significantly higher accuracy in aligning the estimated confidence scores with the correctness of the LLM's predictions and lower calibration error. Furthermore, InternalInspector excels at HaluEval, a hallucination detection benchmark, outperforming other internal-based confidence estimation methods in this task",

With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), many researchers have employed LLMs as the ESC models. However, the evaluation of these LLM-based ESCs remains uncertain. In detail, we first re-organize 2,801 role-playing cards from seven existing datasets to define the roles of the role-playing agent. Second, we train a specific role-playing model called ESC-Role which behaves more like a confused person than GPT-4. Third, through ESC-Role and organized role cards, we systematically conduct experiments using 14 LLMs as the ESC models, including general AI-assistant LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) and ESC-oriented LLMs (e.g., ExTES-Llama). We conduct comprehensive human annotations on interactive multi-turn dialogues of different ESC models. The results show that ESC-oriented LLMs exhibit superior ESC abilities compared to general AI-assistant LLMs, but there is still a gap behind human performance.

However, data generation at scale using a teacher LLM can be costly, and full finetuning can be computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce Selfâ€“Boost, an iterative data augmentation and instruction finetuning strategy that has no external dependence on any teacher models. Selfâ€“Boost uses parameter efficient finetuning (PEFT) with Llama 3 8B to instruction finetune a model using the seed data, uses the same model to generate examples similar to the misclassifications, and also the same model to verify and filter the generated examples.

    "abstract": "Large language models have become increasingly prominent, also signaling a shift towards multimodality as the next frontier in artificial intelligence, where their embeddings are harnessed as prompts to generate textual content. Vision-language models (VLMs) stand at the forefront of this advancement, offering innovative ways to combine visual and textual data for enhanced understanding and interaction. However, this integration also enlarges the attack surface. Patch-based adversarial attack is considered the most realistic threat model in physical vision applications, as demonstrated in many existing literature. In this paper, we propose to address patched visual prompt injection, where adversaries exploit adversarial patches to generate target content in VLMs. Our investigation reveals that patched adversarial prompts exhibit sensitivity to pixel-wise randomization, a trait that remains robust even against adaptive attacks designed to counteract such defenses. Leveraging this insight, we introduce SmoothVLM, a defense mechanism rooted in smoothing techniques, specifically tailored to protect VLMs from the threat of patched visual prompt injectors. Our framework significantly lowers the attack success rate to a range between 0% and 5.0% on two leading VLMs, while achieving around 67.3% to 95.0% context recovery of the benign images, demonstrating a balance between security and usability",

This task is crucial for promoting consistent judgments in similar cases, effectively enhancing judicial fairness and improving work efficiency for judges. However, existing works face two main challenges for real-world applications: existing works mainly focus on case-to-case retrieval using lengthy queries, which does not match real-world scenarios; and the limited data scale, with current datasets containing only hundreds of queries, is insufficient to satisfy the training requirements of existing data-hungry neural models. To address these issues, we introduce an automated method to construct synthetic query-candidate pairs and build the largest LCR dataset to date, LEAD, which is hundreds of times larger than existing datasets. This data construction method can provide ample training signals for LCR models. Experimental results demonstrate that model training with our constructed data can achieve state-of-the-art results on two widely-used LCR benchmarks. Besides, the construction method can also be applied to civil cases and achieve promising results. The code and dataset used in this paper will be released to promote the development of LCR",

    "abstract": "To address the issues of insufficient knowledge and hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous studies have explored integrating LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KGs). However, these methods are typically evaluated on conventional Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) with complete KGs, where all factual triples required for each question are entirely covered by the given KG. In such cases, LLMs primarily act as an agent to find answer entities within the KG, rather than effectively integrating the internal knowledge of LLMs and external knowledge sources such as KGs. In fact, KGs are often incomplete to cover all the knowledge required to answer questions. To simulate these real-world scenarios and evaluate the ability of LLMs to integrate internal and external knowledge, we propose leveraging LLMs for QA under Incomplete Knowledge Graph (IKGQA), where the provided KG lacks some of the factual triples for each question, and construct corresponding datasets. To handle IKGQA, we propose a training-free method called Generate-on-Graph (GoG), which can generate new factual triples while exploring KGs. Specifically, GoG performs reasoning through a Thinking-Searching-Generating framework, which treats LLM as both Agent and KG in IKGQA. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our GoG outperforms all previous methods",

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian in-Context example Selection method (ByCS) for ICL. Extending the inference probability conditioned on in-context examples based on Bayes' theorem, ByCS focuses on the inverse inference conditioned on test input. Following the assumption that accurate inverse inference probability (likelihood) will result in accurate inference probability (posterior), in-context examples are selected based on their inverse inference results. Diverse and extensive cross-tasking and cross-modality experiments are performed with speech, text, and image examples.

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become integral to advancing NLP tasks, their sequential decoding becomes a bottleneck to achieving more efficient inference. Multi-Draft Speculative Decoding (MDSD) emerges as a promising solution, where a small draft model produces a tree of tokens with each path as a draft predicting the target LLM's outputs, which is then verified by the target LLM in parallel. However, current methods rely on Recursive Rejection Sampling (RRS) and its variants, which suffer from low acceptance rates in proceeding drafts, diminishing the merits of multiple drafts. In this work, we investigate this critical inefficiency and sub-optimality through an optimal transport (OT) formulation that aims to maximize the acceptance rate by optimizing the joint distribution $\\pi(x_{1:k},y)$ of $k$-draft tokens $x_{1:k}$ and an accepted token $y$. We show that the OT can be greatly simplified to a much smaller Linear Programming (LP) focusing on a few probabilities in $\\pi(x_{1:k},y)$. Moreover, our analysis of different choices for the marginal distribution $Q(x_{1:k})$ reveals its importance to the sampling effectiveness and efficiency. Motivated by the new insight, we introduce SpecHub, which adopts a special design of $Q(x_{1:k})$ that significantly accelerates the LP and provably achieves a higher acceptance rate than existing strategies. SpecHub can be seamlessly integrated into existing MDSD frameworks, improving their acceptance rate while only incurring linear computational overhead. In extensive experiments, Spechub consistently generates 0.05-0.27 and 0.02-0.16 more tokens per step than RRS with and without replacement and achieves equivalent batch efficiency with half as much concurrency.

Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMa-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Phi-v3) validated using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, BertScore, and GPT-4 based evaluations. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost \"thoughts-to-text\" technology, applicable to neuroscience and NLP",

    "title": "Towards Difficulty-Agnostic Efficient Transfer Learning for Vision-Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable applicability across a variety of downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification. Recently, the use of prompts or adapters for efficient transfer learning (ETL) has gained significant attention for effectively adapting to downstream tasks. However, previous studies have overlooked the challenge of varying transfer difficulty of downstream tasks. In this paper, we empirically analyze how each ETL method behaves with respect to transfer difficulty. Our observations indicate that utilizing vision prompts and text adapters is crucial for adaptability and generalizability in domains with high difficulty. Also, by applying an adaptive ensemble approach that integrates task-adapted VLMs with pre-trained VLMs and strategically leverages more general knowledge in low-difficulty and less in high-difficulty domains, we consistently enhance performance across both types of domains. Based on these observations, we propose an adaptive ensemble method that combines visual prompts and text adapters with pre-trained VLMs, tailored by transfer difficulty, to achieve optimal performance for any target domain. Upon experimenting with extensive benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms all baselines, particularly on unseen tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness",

    "title": "A Collaborative Reasoning Framework Powered by Reinforcement Learning and Large Language Models for Complex Questions Answering over Knowledge Graph",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to automatically answer natural language questions by reasoning across multiple triples in knowledge graphs (KGs). Reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods are introduced to enhance model interpretability. Nevertheless, when addressing complex questions requiring long-term reasoning, the RL agent is usually misled by aimless exploration, as it lacks common learning practices with prior knowledge. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been proven to encode vast amounts of knowledge about the world and possess remarkable reasoning capabilities. However, they often encounter challenges with hallucination issues, failing to address complex questions that demand deep and deliberate reasoning. In this paper, we propose a collaborative reasoning framework (CRF) powered by RL and LLMs to answer complex questions based on the knowledge graph. Our approach leverages the common sense priors contained in LLMs while utilizing RL to provide learning from the environment, resulting in a hierarchical agent that uses LLMs to solve the complex KGQA task. By combining LLMs and the RL policy, the high-level agent accurately identifies constraints encountered during reasoning, while the low-level agent conducts efficient path reasoning by selecting the most promising relations in KG. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which surpasses state-of-the-art approaches",

    "title": "Dual-Space Knowledge Distillation for Large Language Models",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is known as a promising solution to compress large language models (LLMs) via transferring their knowledge to smaller models. During this process, white-box KD methods usually minimize the distance between the output distributions of the two models so that more knowledge can be transferred. However, in the current white-box KD framework, the output distributions are from the respective output spaces of the two models, using their own prediction heads. We argue that the space discrepancy will lead to low similarity between the teacher model and the student model on both representation and distribution levels. Furthermore, this discrepancy also hinders the KD process between models with different vocabularies, which is common for current LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a dual-space knowledge distillation (DSKD) framework that unifies the output spaces of the two models for KD. On the basis of DSKD, we further develop a cross-model attention mechanism, which can automatically align the representations of the two models with different vocabularies. Thus, our framework is not only compatible with various distance functions for KD (e.g., KL divergence) like the current framework, but also supports KD between any two LLMs regardless of their vocabularies. Experiments on task-agnostic instruction-following benchmarks show that DSKD significantly outperforms the current white-box KD framework with various distance functions, and also surpasses existing KD methods for LLMs with different vocabularies",
