    "abstract": "We study the integration of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) from clinical study into a joint predictive model. Compared to the totally black-box models, a competitive model with explainable structure is much more desirable. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel Gaussian Matrix Graphical Encoder(GMGE) based on matrix normal graphical model to encode unstructured medical text and simultaneously learn the underlying conditional dependency graph of concepts. We further present DiMES, a Diagnostic Model with Explainable Structure, which integrates the concept graph generated by GMGE with structured data such as patient's physical examination measures. Utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), DiMES encodes patient features based on the concept graph for downstream tasks, providing clinicians with accurate predictive information to assist in diagnostic decisions and treatment plan design. The effectiveness of the proposed DiMES is validated through its application on four downstream diagnostic predictive tasks(ACL, PCL, MMI and PS)",

    "title": "Rethinking Pragmatics in Large Language Models: Towards Open-Ended Evaluation and Preference Tuning",
    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges of assessing and enhancing social-pragmatic inference in large language models (LLMs). We first highlight the inadequacy of current accuracy-based multiple choice question answering (MCQA) formats in assessing social-pragmatic reasoning, and propose the direct evaluation of models' free-form responses as measure, which - as our results show - correlates better with human judgement. Further, we explore the enhancement of pragmatic abilities in LLMs, proposing the use of preference optimization (PO) over supervised finetuning (SFT) since there's no ``gold'' answer in responding to a social situation. Our results indicate that preferential tuning significantly outperforms and proves more robust than SFT across pragmatic phenomena, and offers a near-free launch to enhance models' pragmatic ability without compromising generic abilities. Lastly, we delve into LLMs' internal space and demonstrate that the substantial boost of the model's pragmatic reasoning capabilities is linked to deeper layer representation, mirroring human's high-level thinking. Our experiments span multiple pragmatic and social reasoning data sources, covering diverse phenomena, as well as a image referential game requiring multimodal theory of mind (ToM). With our refined paradigms for evaluating and enhancing pragmatic inference, this paper offers key insights for developing more socially aware language models",

    "abstract": "In low-resource settings, the problem is often not only the amount of data available, but also the quality, and in ways that are entirely foreign to high-resourced languages. For instance, many extreme low-resource languages have only recently acquired writing systems. This may result in multiple writing systems competing for dominance or, within a single writing system, non-standardized spelling. Translating to and from low-resource languages is a challenge for machine translation (MT) systems due to a lack of suitable parallel data. In this case study, we focus on the impact of manual data cleaning on the performance of learning machine translation models. We focus on Bambara, the vehicular language of Mali, and introduce the largest curated dataset for multilingual translation. We finetune six commonly used transformer-based language models, i.e., AfriMBART, AfriMT5, AfriM2M100, Mistral, Open-Llama-7B, and Meta-Llama3-8B on three existing Bambara-French language pair datasets and our curated dataset. We show that our new aligned and curated multilingual dataset enhances the translation quality of all studied models using the BLEU, CHRF++, and AfriCOMET evaluation metrics",

    "abstract": "Procedural texts, such as recipes and instruction manuals, are crucial for understanding processes involving multiple entities over time. Entity state tracking, which monitors the states of specific entities at each time step, is a key task in this domain. However, existing benchmarks heavily rely on manually annotated datasets, limiting scalability. We propose a novel task of step image generation in recipes, using step images as visual supervision for tracking entity states in procedural text without relying on manually annotated data. By generating step images, we can visualize the entity states in each step. For this task, we collect high-quality multimodal recipe datasets, theSpruceEats. Addressing the limitation of existing two-stage methods in achieving deep interaction between text and image, this paper introduces an explicit state modeling approach based on multimodal generative models. Experiments on theSpruceEats dataset demonstrate that our method enhance entity state tracking and image generation quality compared to existing methods, improving the CLIP similarity metric by 10.2% compared to existing methods",

Secondly, by introducing refinement layers, we allow interactions between arc representations, facilitating interactions between arcs.

Our experiments demonstrate that, while longer contexts can accommodate more examples, simply increasing the number of demonstrations does not guarantee improved performance. Smart ICL selection remains crucial, even with thousands of demonstrations. To further enhance ICL in this setting, we introduce Refract ICL, a novel ICL selection algorithm specifically designed to focus LLM attention on challenging examples by strategically repeating them within the context and incorporating zero-shot predictions as error signals. Our results show that Refract ICL significantly improves the performance of extremely long-context models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, particularly on tasks with a smaller number of output classes",

    "abstract": "Recently, Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers have garnered increasing attention due to their advantages in model capacity and computational efficiency. However, studies have indicated that MoE Transformers underperform vanilla Transformers in many downstream tasks, significantly diminishing the practical value of MoE models. To explain this issue, we propose that the pre-training performance and transfer capability of a model are joint determinants of its downstream task performance. MoE models, in comparison to vanilla models, have poorer transfer capability, leading to their subpar performance in downstream tasks. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of transfer capability distillation, positing that although vanilla models have weaker performance, they are effective teachers of transfer capability. The MoE models guided by vanilla models can achieve both strong pre-training performance and transfer capability, ultimately enhancing their performance in downstream tasks. We design a specific distillation method and conduct experiments on the BERT architecture. Experimental results show a significant improvement in downstream performance of MoE models, and many further evidences also strongly support the concept of transfer capability distillation.

Therefore, in this study, we propose a method to construct tasks to comprehensively evaluate the robustness against format changes of MCQs by decomposing the answering process into several steps. Using this dataset, we evaluate six LLMs, such as Llama3-70B and Mixtral-8x7B. Consequently, the lack of robustness to differences in the format of MCQs becomes evident.

Drawing inspiration from adversarial training in deep learning and LLM agent learning processes, we introduce the In-Context Adversarial Game (ICAG) for defending against jailbreaks without the need for fine-tuning. ICAG leverages agent learning to conduct an adversarial game, aiming to dynamically extend knowledge to defend against jailbreaks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on static datasets, ICAG employs an iterative process to enhance both the defense and attack agents. This continuous improvement process strengthens defenses against newly generated jailbreak prompts. Our empirical studies affirm ICAG's efficacy, where LLMs safeguarded by ICAG exhibit significantly reduced jailbreak success rates across various attack scenarios. Moreover, ICAG demonstrates remarkable transferability to other LLMs, indicating its potential as a versatile defense mechanism",

Our study reveals three primary findings: (i) Despite these factors significantly influencing overall model performance, some abilities are more responsive to scaling, while others show high resistance. (ii) The sensitivity of different abilities to these factors can be explained by their Complexity and Transference, which indicate the relative importance of each factor in learning specific abilities.

We discover that the difference in scores assigned to response pairs by the reward model effectively indicates the quality of data, and data of varying qualities show significant distinctions in reward model training.

Although current LLMs are achieving increasingly better performance on various benchmarks, their performance in practical applications does not always match their benchmark results. Leakage of benchmarks can prevent the accurate assessment of LLMs' true performance. However, constructing new benchmarks is costly, labor-intensive and still carries the risk of leakage. Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question Can we reuse these leaked benchmarks for LLM evaluation? We propose Inference-Time Decontamination (ITD) to address this issue by detecting and rewriting leaked samples without altering their difficulties. ITD can mitigate performance inflation caused by memorizing leaked benchmarks. Our proof-of-concept experiments demonstrate that ITD reduces inflated accuracy by 22.9\\% on GSM8K and 19.0\\% on MMLU. On MMLU, using Inference-time Decontamination can lead to a decrease in the results of Phi3 and Mistral by 6.7\\% and 3.6\\% respectively.

This paper introduces a novel benchmark, BeyondX, designed to address these limitations by incorporating problems with multiple unknowns. Recognizing the challenges in proposing multi-unknown problems from scratch, we developed BeyondX using an innovative automated pipeline that progressively increases complexity by expanding the number of unknowns in simpler problems. Empirical study on BeyondX reveals that the performance of existing LLMs, even those fine-tuned specifically on math tasks, significantly decreases as the number of unknowns increases - with a performance drop of up to 70% observed in GPT-4. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Formulate-and-Solve strategy, a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of unknowns.

However, DPO requires paired preference data which is harder and more expensive to obtain compared to binary preference data. We propose a retrieval-based method named Retrieval-DPO to align LLMs under binary preference data situation. The core idea of our method is that learning how to align can be achieved with non-paired preference data of similar questions rather than strictly paired preference data considering the learning process of human. For instance, to teach the LLM to learn how to treat multiple perspectives, other comprehensive golden answers of similar question may have similar positive effects as the golden answer of the same question. Following this idea, we retrieve an example with opposite label from the retrieval database for a binary preference data in the training set. After the retrieval process, we get a pair of preference data but with possibly different questions and then adopt the DOVE \\cite{bansal2024comparing} optimization objective for the alignment. We compare Retrieval-DPO with other preference optimization algorithms which do not need paired preference data such as Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) and Unified Language Model Alignment (ULMA). We find that our method significantly outperforms KTO and ULMA on helpful-base subset of HH dataset (over 13\\%) and slightly outperforms KTO on harmless-base subset of HH dataset and controlled sentiment generation task.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using preference datasets, enabling the LLM to generate outputs that align with human preferences. Given the sensitive nature of these preference datasets held by various clients, there is a need to implement RLHF within a federated learning (FL) framework, where clients are reluctant to share their data due to privacy concerns. To address this, we introduce a feasible framework in which clients collaboratively train a binary selector with their preference datasets using our proposed FedBis. With a well-trained selector, we can further enhance the LLM that generates human-preferred completions. Meanwhile, we propose a novel algorithm, FedBiscuit, that trains multiple selectors by organizing clients into balanced and disjoint clusters based on their preferences. Compared to the FedBis, FedBisuit demonstrates superior performance in simulating human preferences for pairwise completions. Our extensive experiments on federated human preference datasets -- marking the first benchmark to address heterogeneous data partitioning among clients -- demonstrate that FedBisuit outperforms FedBis and even surpasses traditional centralized training",

Solving these puzzles necessitates inferring aspects of a language's grammatical structure from a small number of examples. Such puzzles provide a natural testbed for language models, as they require compositional generalization and few-shot inductive reasoning. Consisting solely of new puzzles written specifically for this work, ModeLing has no risk of appearing in the training data of existing AI systems: this ameliorates the risk of data leakage, a potential confounder for many prior evaluations of reasoning. Evaluating several large open source language models and GPT on our benchmark, we observe non-negligible accuracy, demonstrating few-shot emergent reasoning ability which cannot merely be attributed to shallow memorization. However, imperfect model performance suggests that ModeLing can be used to measure further progress in linguistic reasoning",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable generalizability in various domains. Despite their extensive knowledge, LLMs still face challenges in efficiently utilizing encoded knowledge to develop accurate and logical reasoning. To mitigate this problem, we introduced the Hint-before-Solving framework (HinSo), which guides the model in generating hints (e.g., specific knowledge or key ideas) for solving the problem before the step-by-step solution. Our studies involving 5 LLMs across 7 datasets of mathematical and commonsense reasoning results indicated that introducing hints before problem-solving can significantly enhance the performance of CoT. To investigate whether LLMs can learn the HinSo pattern and improve their generalization ability, we constructed two large-scale and high-quality training datasets, HST-S and HST-L, containing 7.5k and 75k samples, respectively. The experimental results of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) showed that, under the same settings, the performance of model trained on the HinSo-formatted data improved significantly compared to CoT-formatted data, with a performance increase of 5.1% and 5.6% on the GSM8K, respectively.

Despite the intelligence shown by the general large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing among natural language and different programming languages.

To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging graphical representation into informative knowledge for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into the model parameters via finetuning the models with the help of a pretrained GNN expert model.

Secondly, it includes negative text and images created through fine-grained editing and generation based on existing data, thereby testing the model's ability to correctly reject scenarios where the target object is not visible in the image—an essential aspect often overlooked in existing datasets and approaches. Utilizing this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive evaluations of both state-of-the-art specialist models and MLLMs. Our findings indicate that there remains a significant gap in achieving satisfactory grounding performance.

    "abstract": "Lexical Constrained Generation (LCG) is a fundamental task in text generation. Recent advancement of large pretrained language models (LLMs) has enabled prompt-based controlling for LCG. Despite growing interest in assessing LLMs' capabilities in various aspects, there remains a lack of thorough investigation. To address this gap, we systematically analyze the performance of LLMs on satisfying lexical constraints with prompt-based controlling, as well as their efficacy in downstream applications (such as recipe generation, table-to-text, profile writing, etc). Through extensive experimentation, we identified several key observations that elucidate the limitations of LLMs in LCG, including (1) position bias, where LLMs tend to satisfy constraints that appear in specific positions within the input; (2) insensitive decoding parameters, which minimally impact the performance of LLMs; and (3) the inherent complexity of certain constraints (i.e. compound word). We conclude that there is a complexity bottleneck: LLMs still face significant challenges in consistently satisfying lexical constraints. Additionally, we introduce the Divide and Conquer Generation strategy, effective for both white-box and black-box LLMs, significantly enhancing their performance in LCG tasks. This strategy boosts LLMs' success rate by 93% in the most challenging LCG task, which is 40% more than the baseline. Our analysis aims to provide valuable insights into the performance of LLMs in LCG, and our proposed strategy offers a pathway to more sophisticated and customized text generation applications",

In India, where \"transgender\" was legally recognised as a category only in 2014, and same–sex marriages are yet to be legalised, it becomes crucial to analyse whether and how news media reported the lived realities of vulnerable LGBTQ+ communities during the pandemic. This study analysed articles from online editions of two English–language newspaper websites, which differed vastly in their circulation figures—The Times of India and The Indian Express. The results of our study suggest that these newspaper websites covered articles surrounding various aspects of the lives of LGBTQ+ individuals with a greater focus on transgender communities. However, they lacked quality and depth. Focusing on the period spanning March 2020 to August 2021, we analysed articles from The Times of India and The Indian Express using distil–RoBERTa–base and ChatGPT–3.5 for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modelling. We also compared our results to the period before the pandemic (January 2019–December 2019) to understand the shift in topics and sentiments across the two newspaper websites. Our topic modelling results indicate that The Times of India and The Indian Express primarily wrote soft news on LGBTQ+ communities. Similarly, our sentiment analysis results indicate a difference in prevailing sentiment as depicted by the two models. Furthermore, our manual analysis of the articles indicates that the language used in certain articles by The Times of India was transphobic and obsolete. Our study captures the visibility and representation of the LGBTQ+ communities in online Indian news media outlets, the language they use, and the narratives they follow",

Quantization techniques have emerged as a promising avenue for addressing these challenges while preserving accuracy and making energy efficient. We propose CPTQuant, a comprehensive strategy that introduces correlation-based (CMPQ), pruning-based (PMPQ), and Taylor decomposition-based (TDMPQ) mixed precision techniques. CMPQ adapts the precision level based on canonical correlation analysis of different layers. PMPQ optimizes precision layer-wise based on their sensitivity to sparsity. TDMPQ modifies precision using Taylor decomposition to assess each layer's sensitivity to input perturbation. These strategies allocate higher precision to more sensitive layers while diminishing precision to robust layers. CPTQuant assesses the performance across BERT, OPT-125M, OPT-350M, OPT-1.3B, and OPT-2.7B. We demonstrate up to 4x compression and a 2x-fold increase in efficiency with minimal accuracy drop compared to Hugging Face FP16. PMPQ stands out for achieving a considerably higher model compression. Sensitivity analyses across various LLMs show that the initial and final 30% of layers exhibit higher sensitivities than the remaining layers.

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Collecting high-quality preference datasets for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is resource-intensive and challenging. As a result, researchers often train reward models on extensive offline datasets which aggregate diverse generation sources and scoring/alignment policies. We hypothesize that this aggregation has an averaging effect on reward model scores, which limits signal and impairs the alignment process. Inspired by the field of inverse RL, we define the ``inverse alignment problem'' in language model training, where our objective is to optimize the critic's reward for a fixed actor and a fixed offline preference dataset. We hypothesize that solving the inverse alignment problem will improve reward model quality by providing clearer feedback on the policy's current behavior. To that end, we investigate whether repeatedly fine-tuning a reward model on subsets of the offline preference dataset aligned with a periodically frozen policy during RLHF improves upon vanilla RLHF. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach facilitates superior alignment and faster convergence compared to using an unaligned or out-of-distribution reward model relative to the LLM policy",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "The evaluation paradigm of LLM-as-judge gains popularity due to its significant reduction in human labor and time costs. This approach utilizes one or more large language models (LLMs) to assess the quality of outputs from other LLMs. However, existing methods rely on generic scoring rubrics that fail to consider the specificities of each question and its problem-solving process, compromising precision and stability in assessments. Inspired by human examination scoring processes, we propose a new evaluation paradigm based on self-adaptive rubrics. Specifically, we create detailed scoring rubrics for each question, capturing the primary and secondary criteria in a structured format of scoring and deduction points that mimic a human evaluator's analytical process. Building on this paradigm, we further develop a novel benchmark called INSDA, which covers a range of domains including long-tail knowledge, mathematics, coding, and logical reasoning. INSDA consists of 1,000 meticulously crafted questions, each with its own self-adaptive rubric. To further streamline the evaluation, we train a specialized evaluator language model (evaluator LM) to supplant human graders. Using the same training data, our evaluator LM achieves a higher concordance rate with human grading results than other paradigms, including GPT-4, highlighting the superiority and efficiency of our approach",

    "abstract": "Causal graph recovery is traditionally done using statistical estimation-based methods or based on individual's knowledge about variables of interests. They often suffer from data collection biases and limitations of individuals' knowledge. The advance of large language models (LLMs) provides opportunities to address these problems. We propose a novel method that leverages LLMs to deduce causal relationships in general causal graph recovery tasks. This method leverages knowledge compressed in LLMs and knowledge LLMs extracted from scientific publication database as well as experiment data about factors of interest to achieve this goal. Our method gives a prompting strategy to extract associational relationships among those factors and a mechanism to perform causality verification for these associations. Comparing to other LLM-based methods that directly instruct LLMs to do the highly complex causal reasoning, our method shows clear advantage on causal graph quality on benchmark datasets. More importantly, as causality among some factors may change as new research results emerge, our method show sensitivity to new evidence in the literature and can provide useful information for updating causal graphs accordingly",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of large language models (LLM), the evaluation of LLM becomes increasingly important. Measuring text gener- ation tasks such as summarization and article creation is very difficult. Especially in spe- cific application domains (e.g., to-business or to-customer service), in-house evaluation cri- teria have to meet not only general standards (correctness, helpfulness and creativity, etc.) but also specific needs of customers and busi- ness security requirements at the same time, making the evaluation more difficult. So far, the evaluation of LLM in business scenarios has mainly relied on manual, which is expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a model-based evaluation method: TALEC, which allows users to flexibly set their own evaluation criteria, and uses in-context learning (ICL) to teach judge model these in-house cri- teria. In addition, we try combining zero-shot and few-shot to make the judge model focus on more information. We also propose a prompt paradigm and an engineering approach to ad- just and iterate the shots ,helping judge model to better understand the complex criteria. We then compare fine-tuning with ICL, finding that fine-tuning can be replaced by ICL. TALEC demonstrates a strong capability to accurately reflect human preferences and achieves a cor- relation of over 80% with human judgments, outperforming even the inter-human correlation in some tasks",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL) techniques optimally utilize a labeling budget by iteratively selecting instances that are most valuable for learning. However, they lack \"prerequisite checks\", i.e., there are no prescribed criteria to pick an AL algorithm best suited for a dataset. A practitioner must pick a technique they \\emph{trust} would beat random sampling, based on prior reported results, and hope that it is resilient to the many variables in their environment: dataset, labeling budget and prediction pipelines. The important questions then are: how often on average, do we expect any AL technique to reliably beat the computationally cheap and easy-to-implement strategy of random sampling? Does it at least make sense to use AL in an ``Always ON'' mode in a prediction pipeline, so that while it might not always help, it never under-performs random sampling? How much of a role does the prediction pipeline play in AL's success? We examine these questions in detail for the task of text classification using pre-trained representations, which are ubiquitous today. Our primary contribution here is a rigorous evaluation of AL techniques, old and new, across setups that vary wrt datasets, text representations and classifiers. This unlocks multiple insights around warm-up times, i.e., number of labels before gains from AL are seen, viability of an ``Always ON'' mode and the relative significance of different factors. Additionally, we release a framework for rigorous benchmarking of AL techniques for text classification",

Grounded in the analysis of real-world data from a linguistic perspective, we decompose public-speaking style into key sub-styles to pose challenges and quantify the style modeling capability of LLMs. For such intricate text style transfer, we further propose a fine-grained evaluation framework to analyze the characteristics and identify the problems of stylized texts. Comprehensive experiments suggest that current LLMs struggle to generate public speaking texts that align with human preferences, primarily due to excessive stylization and loss of semantic information.

    "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across various fields, hallucination remains a significant challenge. Recent studies have explored hallucinations through the lens of internal representations, proposing mechanisms to decipher LLMs' adherence to facts. However, these approaches often fail to generalize to out-of-distribution data, leading to concerns about whether internal representation patterns reflect fundamental factual awareness, or only overfit spurious correlations on the specific datasets. In this work, we investigate whether a universal truthfulness hyperplane that distinguishes the model's factually correct and incorrect outputs exists within the model. To this end, we scale up the number of training datasets and conduct an extensive evaluation -- we train the truthfulness hyperplane on a diverse collection of over 40 datasets and examine its cross-task, cross-domain, and in-domain generalization. Our results indicate that increasing the diversity of the training datasets significantly enhances the performance in all scenarios, while the volume of data samples plays a less critical role. This finding supports the optimistic hypothesis that a universal truthfulness hyperplane may indeed exist within the model, offering promising directions for future research",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently generate inaccurate responses -- this can be particularly dangerous in sensitive areas like medicine and healthcare. Current methods for detecting hallucinations involve sampling answers multiple times, making them computationally intensive. In this study, we introduce HalluCheck, a novel hallucination detection module that identifies factual elements or atomic facts within a text. HalluCheck operates on the premise that responses to questions probing factual answers should be consistent both within a single LLM and across different LLMs. To improve system robustness, we incorporate a token-probability-based double-check mechanism. For hallucinated facts, inconsistencies or a lack of model confidence during generation will be evident. We evaluate our detection module on fact-based datasets such as NQ\\_Open, HotpotQA, and WebQ, by building upon open-source LLMs such as LLaMa-2 (7B)-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct. Finally, we compare the generated output with the correct answers to determine sentence-level AUC-ROC scores for hallucination detection. Our results demonstrate that HalluCheck can (i) detect hallucinated facts and (ii) achieve significantly higher AUC-ROC scores compared to existing baselines that operate under similar conditions, specifically those that do not utilize external databases for hallucination detection",

The prevailing search algorithms tend to focus solely on performance enhancement, ignoring the cost-effectiveness trade-off. To address these challenges, we first utilize the 3E Criteria to systematically evaluate the cost-benefit balance of current search strategies. We found current methods typically sacrifice vast efficiency for marginal improvement of effectiveness. In order to empower LLMs effective decision-making capability with balanced efficiency, we present a plug-and-play framework with Speculative Reward Model (SRM), which leverages external reward assigner to speculate the preferential actions, not just rely on self-evaluation inside LLMs. Through speculative verification approach for pruning and efficient navigation toward more promising steps, SRM boosts decision-making ability of LLM cost-effectively. We evaluate SRM on several complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and numerical reasoning for specific fields. Our results demonstrate the superiority of SRM for inference efficiency, which significantly lowers cost to a fraction of the original search framework's by 1/10 on average, without sacrificing effectiveness",

Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification.

We introduce a new metrics RIG (raw information gain) in order to do so. Any LLM (large language model) could be considered a \"black box\" of compressed information. It is hard to measure what amount of information is stored inside the model regarding any domain. The contrast between the size of a trained model of around 43GB compared to 15 trillion tokens of training data is staggering The other issue is to figure out where do the limits come from: is it an architectural constraint or is the limitation coming from the data used in training. So far the most common way to identify if the model is properly trained and contains necessary information is to put it through a list of benchmarks and the decision is based on either it's ranking or some educated guess of a score threshold. Keeping in mind that the most of those benchmarks become part of training data for upcoming models we face a vicious cycle of never ending benchmark creation. Taken into account constant size growth of both language models and datasets we face an challenge of losing a track of what is efficient and what is not to train models as well as simple scale of the datasets makes them almost impossible to supervise at all, what is an immense obstacle when we need to update any language model according to different environments those are implemented at and we need to bring ethical issues, actuality of the human knowledge and controversial statements altogether",

In the legal field, LLMs often provide generalized responses, lacking the necessary specificity for expert legal advice.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a popular approach to addressing these issues. However, existing methods often focus solely on semantic-level similarity, neglecting the logical structure relationships between different legal questions.

Secondly, the DSSM model that integrates logical structure and semantic information is used to retrieve the most relevant candidate questions from the database. Finally, in-context learning is used to generate the final answer. Experiments on a real-world legal QA dataset, using both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

From the pool of 22k questions, we utilize 4k to create the benchmark that offers balanced coverage of subjects and incorporates a diverse range of case analysis techniques. Furthermore, we evaluate a range of existing large language models(LLMs), spanning from open-sourced to proprietary models. Our experiments and analysis demonstrate that CPsyExam serves as an effective benchmark for enhancing the understanding of psychology within LLMs and enables the comparison of LLMs across various granularities",

    "abstract": "Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent tasks is critical in developing language agents. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a promising technique for this adaptation with the alleviation of compounding errors, offering a means to directly optimize Reinforcement Learning (RL) objectives. However, applying DPO to multi-turn tasks presents challenges due to the inability to cancel the partition function. Overcoming this obstacle involves making the partition function independent of the current state and addressing length disparities between preferred and dis-preferred trajectories. In this light, we replace the policy constraint with the state-action occupancy measure constraint in the RL objective and add length normalization to the Bradley-Terry model, yielding a novel loss function named DMPO for multi-turn agent tasks with theoretical explanations. Extensive experiments on three multi-turn agent task datasets confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the DMPO loss",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promising results in various tasks, but their ability to perceive the visual world with deep, hierarchical understanding similar to humans remains uncertain. To address this gap, we introduce CONSTRUCTURE, a novel concept-level benchmark to assess MLLMs' hierarchical concept understanding and reasoning abilities. Our goal is to evaluate MLLMs across four key aspects: 1) Understanding atomic concepts at different levels of abstraction; 2) Performing upward abstraction reasoning across concepts; 3) Achieving downward concretization reasoning across concepts; and 4) Conducting multi-hop reasoning between sibling or common ancestor concepts. Our findings indicate that even state-of-the-art multimodal models struggle with concept structure reasoning (e.g., GPT-4o averages a score of 62.1\\%). We summarize key findings of MLLMs in concept structure reasoning evaluation. Morever, we provide key insights from experiments using CoT prompting and fine-tuning to enhance their abilities",

To address these challenges, we propose Chain of Condition, a novel prompting approach by firstly identifying all conditions and constructing their logical relationships explicitly according to the document, then verifying whether these conditions are satisfied, finally solving the logical expression by tools to indicate any missing conditions and generating the answer based on the resolved conditions. The experiments on two benchmark conditional question answering datasets shows chain of condition outperforms existing prompting baselines, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

While persuasive strategies have been incorporated in dialogue systems to provide personalized services, current research primarily focuses on studying persuasive strategies from persuader's perspective, with limited exploration of persuadee's susceptibility towards these strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task called Susceptibility Strategy Detection, aimed at identifying the persuasive strategies that users are most susceptible to. To support this new task, we develop a refined dataset P4G+, and propose a dual attitude-sensitive framework to detect susceptibility strategy by analyzing the persuasive process, user interactions, and content within dialogues.

However, their performance may sometimes decline following self-correction, either because the feedback contains errors or because they unnecessarily attempt to refine an already accurate response. To address these limitations, we investigate whether LLMs can generate meta-feedback that pinpoints errors in the feedback rather than the response.While the ability of LLMs to generate self-feedback has been well-researched, their potential to provide constructive meta-feedback remains under-explored. We design a novel self-correction prompting framework, Feedback-on-Feedback (FoF), which leverages meta-feedback to improve the feedback before refining the response. Our framework first samples multiple feedbacks for the initial response, and prompts the LLM to generate a meta-feedback that analyze the inconsistency between these feedbacks. Based on the meta-feedback, the LLM generates a refined feedback that subsequently guides the revision of the response. Our FoF framework uniformly outperforms competitive baselines across two base models in different sizes and three datasets spanning arithmetic reasoning, machine translation and programming, with an improvement of up to 1.68% in GSM8K task by LLaMA3-8B model",

    "volume": "review",
    "abstract": "Long-context modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered widespread attention, leading to the emergence of LLMs with ultra-context windows. Meanwhile, benchmarks for evaluating long-context language models are gradually catching up. However, existing benchmarks employ irrelevant noise texts to artificially extend the length of test cases, diverging from the real-world scenarios of long-context applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel long-context benchmark, Loong, aligning with realistic scenarios through extended multi-document question answering (QA). Unlike typical document QA, in Loong's test cases, each document is relevant to the final answer, ignoring any document will lead to the failure of the answer. Furthermore, Loong introduces four types of tasks with a range of context lengths: Spotlight Locating, Comparison, Clustering, and Chain of Reasoning, to facilitate a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of long-context understanding. Extensive experiments indicate that existing long-context language models still exhibit considerable potential for enhancement. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) achieves poor performance, demonstrating that Loong can reliably assess the model's long-context modeling capabilities",

    "abstract": "LLMs as general-purpose agents have gained widespread application in practical domains due to robust autonomous decision-making capabilities and extensive world knowledge. However, recent studies have highlighted that the dynamicity inherent in real-world environments poses significant challenges to the decision-making abilities of LLM agents, making the investigation of LLM decision-making boundaries in dynamic environments an urgent and formidable task. Current evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on assessing LLM decision-making performance in static and interactive environments, which significantly differ from the dynamicity present in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, existing evaluation frameworks lack fine-grained assessments of LLMs' capabilities, providing limited insights during the evaluation process and hindering a comprehensive understanding of the models' capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose FD-Bench, a framework for evaluating the decision-making abilities of LLM agents in dynamic scenarios. FD-Bench employs a fire evacuation scenario as a representative dynamic setting, offering a generalized evaluation framework and a step-wise evaluation strategy to comprehensively analyze and capture variations in decision-making abilities. This framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the decision-making capabilities and limitations of LLM agents in dynamic environments, laying the foundation for their potential deployment in more realistic physical scenarios",

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 have shown greater capability in translating figurative language compared to state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) systems. However, the impact of different prompting methods and combining NMTs and LLMs on idiom translation remains unexplored. This paper introduces two parallel datasets for Persian\\rightarrow English and English\\rightarrow Persian translation to address these challenges. The Persian idiom examples are sampled from our PersianIdioms resource, which is compiled from an online dictionary and contains 2200 idioms with their meanings and popularity scores. Using these datasets, we evaluate GPT models, Google Translate, and their combination, focusing on idiom translation accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance. Additionally, we assess existing automatic evaluation metrics and GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for evaluating idiomatic translations. Our results indicate that while Google Translate shows superior fluency, GPT-3.5 excels in accurately translating idioms. We also show that models are better at translating English idioms than Persian ones, and different configurations of models perform differently depending on the direction of translation.

To address this, we conducted a large-scale user study with 85 clinicians in the context of human-AI collaborative chest X-ray analysis. We evaluated three types of explanations: saliency maps, natural language explanations, and their combination. We specifically examine how different explanation types influence users depending on whether the AI is correct.
